It was mid-June, a few days after he had toppled o_ a 12-foot-tall platform during a Foo Fighters gig in Sweden, breaking his right fibula and dislocating his ankle. The damage was significant, requiring surgery and six metal screws in his leg. \u201cA physical therapist told me it was like my ankle got into a 40-mile-per-hour car crash,\u201d Grohl says. \u201cIt\u2019s like my ankle got its ass kicked by Ronda Rousey.\u201d Worst of all, the Foos had to cancel the rest of their European tour, seven dates in all. Their upcoming North American tour \u2013 including a 20th-anniversary concert in Washington, D.C., on July 4th \u2013 was in jeopardy as well.<\/p>\n<p>Now, as he sat in an OxyContininduced haze in London, Grohl had a mystic vision that saved the Foos\u2019 summer plans. Reaching for a stack of hotel stationery, he sketched a \u201cridiculous, primitive drawing\u201d of a fantastical, guitar-adorned throne that would allow him to prop up his bum leg in concert, and he had Foo Fighters\u2019 lighting guy build it. \u201cWhen I saw that thing, I just fucking cracked up,\u201d Grohl says, laughing. \u201cIt was exactly what I wanted it to be \u2013 and it worked!\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Thanks to the throne, Grohl was onstage for the July 4th show \u2013 and for every Foos gig since. For a guy who\u2019s used to prowling the stage, sitting down for an entire show has been a challenge. \u201cI\u2019ve got my leg up on that thing, but the rest of my body is like fucking Joe Cocker up there,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s insane.\u201d Grohl has been opening shows by playing the riff to \u201cEverlong\u201d from behind a giant curtain, which pulls away to reveal him sitting, leg outstretched, to the elated laughter of fans. At the Foos\u2019 gig at Boston\u2019s Fenway Park, Grohl brought out his orthopedic surgeon to help the band cover the White Stripes\u2019 \u201cSeven Nation Army.\u201d Grohl says the outpouring of support from fans has been overwhelming: Every night when he takes the stage, he looks out and is met by crowds of people wearing Tshirts emblazoned with an X-ray of his broken leg. \u201cIt\u2019s really weird,\u201d he says.<\/p>\n<p>The Foo Fighters tour runs into the fall, with some short breaks, but the band is already beginning to focus on the second season of its HBO series, <i>Sonic Highways.<\/i> Grohl hints that the premise of the show \u2013 the Foos travel to different cities and write and record with local heroes \u2013 might get tweaked this time around. \u201cI have a pretty good idea of what I\u2019d like to do,\u201d Grohl says. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t always have to be the Foo Fighters. It doesn\u2019t always have to be America. I\u2019ve already contacted a ton of musicians to see if they\u2019d be interested in being involved, and every single one of them said yes.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"\/var\/site_2923\/storage\/images\/media2\/images\/f0014-016\/37607-1-eng-GB\/f0014-012.jpg\" width=\"370\" height=\"503\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0014-01\" title=\"f0014-01\" \/>\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>ELECTRIC CHAIR<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Grohl\u2019s sketch of the guitar throne, built by his lighting guy.<\/p>\n <span class=\"credit\">\nS.

The group was spearheaded by Reed Mullin, drummer for hardcore-metal vets Corrosion of Conformity, a longtime friend of Grohl. \u201cReed was my drumming hero when I was 15 or 16,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve stolen so many of his drum riffs from COC\u2019s <i>Animosity<\/i> over the years.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Grohl assumes an unlikely role in Teenage Time Killers: bassist. The group simply asked the Foo singer if he wanted to play the four-string on a number of songs. \u201cIt\u2019s probably my favorite instrument to play standing up,\u201d Grohl says. He handles bass on 11 of the 20 songs on the group\u2019s newly released debut, <i>Greatest Hits Vol. 1.<\/i> \u201cI knocked out my parts in a day or two, and it was so much fun,\u201d says Grohl. \u201cIt was like hardcore karaoke with a bass.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Mullin is also organizing a Teenage Time Killers concert in L.A., to take place in the late summer with as many of the album\u2019s participants as possible \u2013 including Grohl. \u201cOh, my God, I need to learn those fucking songs again,\u201d Grohl says about the prospect. \u201cThose are hard.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Grohl isn\u2019t sure how long it\u2019ll be before he regains full use of his leg. His cast came off within his first week back on the road, and he recently used crutches to walk along the catwalk for acoustic performances of \u201cMy Hero\u201d and \u201cTimes Like These.\u201d \u201cThat show, when the throne comes out and I just fucking jump off it and start running \u2013 it\u2019s going to be a pretty awesome moment,\u201d he says.<\/p>\n","layout":{},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":0,"link_source":"","competition":[],"flatplan_title":"","notes":"","gutter_credit":"","other":"","image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1467287544.3342","name":"f0013-01","source":"NICK WASS\/INVISION\/AP IMAGES","caption":"<p><b>WATCH THE THRONE<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Grohl at RFK Stadium in Washington, D.C., on July 4th.<\/p>\n","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http:\/\/cdn-assets.ziniopro.com\/var\/site_2923\/storage\/images\/media2\/images\/f0013-01\/37614-1-eng-GB\/f0013-012.jpg?t=default_ipad_portrait&ext\/f0013-012_default_ipad_portrait.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"768","height":"967","legacy_id":"3933","is_default":true},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1467287544.3342","name":"f0013-01","source":"NICK WASS\/INVISION\/AP IMAGES","caption":"<p><b>WATCH THE THRONE<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Grohl at RFK Stadium in Washington, D.C., on July 4th.<\/p>\n","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http:\/\/cdn-assets.ziniopro.com\/var\/site_2923\/storage\/images\/media2\/images\/f0013-01\/37614-1-eng-GB\/f0013-012.jpg?t=default_ipad_landscape&ext\/f0013-012_default_ipad_landscape.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"610","height":"768","legacy_id":"3933","is_default":false}],"related_objects":{"image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_1_1467287543.3216","name":"f0014-01","source":"S.

It was the beginning of \u201cCheerleader,\u201d which has since become one of the more unlikely \u2013 and slowest-rising \u2013 Number One pop hits ever. \u201cCheerleader\u201d started as a radio favorite in Jamaica in 2012, became a hit all over Europe in 2014, and finally topped the Hot 100 in mid-July. \u201cMan,\u201d says Pasley, \u201cit\u2019s overwhelming.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Pasley, 28, grew up loving rappers like Tupac and Eminem, but things changed in his early twenties. \u201cI got exposed to melodic aspects of music when I started listening to John Legend, Nat King Cole and Sam Cooke,\u201d he says. His life changed forever when he met with Jamaican producer Clifton Dillon, who fell in love with the early version of \u201cCheerleader\u201d and brought in drumming great Sly Dunbar to play on it. German producer Felix Jaehn later created a remix that has since taken over the world. Now, Omi hopes to have his debut album out by the fall. \u201cThe song is like being off to a good start in a race,\u201d he says. \u201cAll I have to do is maintain my momentum and keep my composure.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"byline\"><b>ANDY GREENE<\/b><\/p>\n","layout":{},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":0,"link_source":"","competition":[],"flatplan_title":"","notes":"","gutter_credit":"","other":"","image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1467287546.7946","name":"f0014-02","source":"SCOTT SCHATEK","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http:\/\/cdn-assets.ziniopro.com\/var\/site_2923\/storage\/images\/media2\/images\/f0014-025\/37643-1-eng-GB\/f0014-022.jpg?t=default_ipad_portrait&ext\/f0014-022_default_ipad_portrait.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"745","height":"1024","legacy_id":"3936","is_default":true},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1467287546.7946","name":"f0014-02","source":"SCOTT SCHATEK","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http:\/\/cdn-assets.ziniopro.com\/var\/site_2923\/storage\/images\/media2\/images\/f0014-025\/37643-1-eng-GB\/f0014-022.jpg?t=default_ipad_landscape&ext\/f0014-022_default_ipad_landscape.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"559","height":"768","legacy_id":"3936","is_default":false}],"url_alias":"http:\/\/site-2923.audiencemedia.com","type":"story","order":"6","folio_number":"14","folio_numbers":"14","pdf_page_index":"14","thumbnail":"http:\/\/cdn-assets.ziniopro.com\/var\/site_2923\/storage\/images\/media2\/images\/f0014-025\/37643-1-eng-GB\/f0014-022.jpg?t=tablet_story_thumbnail&ext\/f0014-022_tablet_story_thumbnail.jpg","color":"FFFFFF","real_id":"3935","main_section_id":"154","ads":[]},{"id":"zinio_28_100340926_1467287548.7341","title":"Jimmy Page Wraps Zep Reissues With a Bang","sub_title":"","author":[{"id":"0","name":"DAVID FRICKE","email":"noreply@audiencemedia.com","is_default":false}],"tag":"","strap_line":"REISSUES","intro":"Guitarist preps blowout \u2018Coda\u2019 set and promises to get busy on new material","body":"\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"\/var\/site_2923\/storage\/images\/media2\/images\/f0015-01\/37679-1-eng-GB\/f0015-012.jpg\" width=\"435\" height=\"655\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0015-01\" title=\"f0015-01\" \/>\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>LOOKING BACK, MOVING FORWARD<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Page in 1977 (above) and this year.<\/p>\n <span class=\"credit\">\nOLLIE MILLINGTON\/REDFERNS\/GETTY IMAGES<\/span><\/figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    <\/div>\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"\/var\/site_2923\/storage\/images\/media2\/images\/f0015-02\/37672-1-eng-GB\/f0015-022.jpg\" width=\"174\" height=\"176\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0015-02\" title=\"f0015-02\" \/>\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n <span class=\"credit\">\n\u00a9 NEAL PRESTON\/CORBIS<\/span><\/figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    <\/div><p><b>J<\/b>IMMY PAGE CAN TELL YOU EXACTly when he will become a solo artist again: on August 2nd, right after the Led Zeppelin guitarist concludes his yearlong deluxe reissues of the band\u2019s studio albums with the July 31st release of expanded editions of 1976\u2019s <i>Presence,<\/i> 1979\u2019s <i>In Through the Out Door<\/i> and the 1982 compilation, <i>Coda<\/i>. On August 1st, \u201cI\u2019ll wipe my brow, lay in bed and read the paper,\u201d Page says with a grin in a New York hotel room.

Now it\u2019s time.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Page still clearly recalls the way he felt about his instrument after Zeppelin broke up in 1980 following the death of drummer John Bonham. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to play the guitar,\u201d Page admits. \u201cIt was going to bring up too much.\u201d A short time later, he learned that he was contractually obligated to produce one last Zeppelin studio LP. \u201cI was like, \u2018Oh, my God, no.\u2019 \u201d The result, <i>Coda,<\/i> \u201cwas a compromise, just an album of things left over.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Surprisingly, the new three-disc version of that album is now the killer climax of Page\u2019s Zeppelinreissue series \u2013 \u201cthe mother of all <i>Coda<\/i>s,\u201d he notes, with major rarities such as \u201cSugar Mama,\u201d an outtake from 1969\u2019s <i>Led Zeppelin<\/i> and two legendary 1972 recordings Page made in India with singer Robert Plant. That\u2019s it, too: \u201cNo more studio stuff,\u201d Page says firmly. \u201cI made sure these reissues were thorough and complete.

Recording in Los Angeles with pop and rock producers Mike Elizondo (Dr. Dre, Fiona Apple) and Rob Cavallo (Green Day), the singerguitarist fused classic influences like Willie Dixon and Albert King with a love for Nirvana and hip-hop, yanking traditional American music into the present.<\/p>\n<p>For his new album, <i>The Story of Sonny Boy Slim<\/i>, the 30-year-old Clark brought it all back home, recording in his native Austin in search of a more relaxed, familiar vibe. \u201cI went in feeling vulnerable \u2013 I was very aware of the sophomore slump,\u201d says Clark. \u201cI really wanted to just come home and be in the studio, hang out and go back to my house.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>While <i>Blak and Blu<\/i> has a slick, L.A. feel, <i>Sonny Boy Slim<\/i> is pure Austin soul. Starting in March of last year, Clark headed into Austin\u2019s Arlyn Studios with little more than ideas and grooves, self-producing the album with his live engineer Bharath \u201cCheex\u201d Ramanath and Arlyn\u2019s chief engineer, Jacob Sciba. \u201cThese guys,\u201d says Clark, referring to Sciba and fellow engineer Joseph Holguin, \u201cput in a lot of hard work to let me be in this room and let loose.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Sessions would often take place late at night and sometimes continue past daybreak, fueled by beloved Arlyn coowner Lisa Fletcher\u2019s combination of locally made vodka and fresh-squeezed grapefruit juice.

Earlier this year, he debuted material from <i>The Story of Sonny Boy Slim<\/i> at Bonnaroo, and he\u2019ll soon be hitting the road with his longtime touring band, which also played on the album. \u201cI really just wanted to put everything together and be 1,000 percent who I am,\u201d Clark says of the finished product. \u201cThis album is exactly what that is: loud.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"byline\"><b>JOE GROSS, <i>Clark photograph by<\/i> Pooneh Ghana <\/b><\/p>\n","layout":{},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":0,"link_source":"","competition":[],"flatplan_title":"","notes":"","gutter_credit":"","other":"","image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1467287554.8298","name":"f0016-01","source":"","caption":"<p><b>HOMECOMING<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Clark at Arlyn Studios in Austin<\/p>\n","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http:\/\/cdn-assets.ziniopro.com\/var\/site_2923\/storage\/images\/media2\/images\/f0016-015\/37737-1-eng-GB\/f0016-012.jpg?t=default_ipad_portrait&ext\/f0016-012_default_ipad_portrait.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"763","height":"1024","legacy_id":"3946","is_default":true},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1467287554.8298","name":"f0016-01","source":"","caption":"<p><b>HOMECOMING<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Clark at Arlyn Studios in Austin<\/p>\n","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http:\/\/cdn-assets.ziniopro.com\/var\/site_2923\/storage\/images\/media2\/images\/f0016-015\/37737-1-eng-GB\/f0016-012.jpg?t=default_ipad_landscape&ext\/f0016-012_default_ipad_landscape.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"572","height":"768","legacy_id":"3946","is_default":false}],"url_alias":"http:\/\/site-2923.audiencemedia.com","type":"story","order":"9","folio_number":"16","folio_numbers":"16","pdf_page_index":"16","thumbnail":"http:\/\/cdn-assets.ziniopro.com\/var\/site_2923\/storage\/images\/media2\/images\/f0016-015\/37737-1-eng-GB\/f0016-012.jpg?t=tablet_story_thumbnail&ext\/f0016-012_tablet_story_thumbnail.jpg","color":"FFFFFF","real_id":"3945","main_section_id":"154","ads":[]},{"id":"zinio_28_100340926_1467287556.768","title":"A Teenage Climate Warrior","sub_title":"","author":[{"id":"0","name":"COCO MCPHERSON","email":"noreply@audiencemedia.com","is_default":false}],"tag":"","strap_line":"ACTIVISM","intro":"Meet the 15-year-old hip-hop artist impacting the environmental debate","body":"\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"\/var\/site_2923\/storage\/images\/media2\/images\/f0016-02\/37766-1-eng-GB\/f0016-022.jpg\" width=\"239\" height=\"410\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0016-02\" title=\"f0016-02\" \/>\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p>Martinez<\/p>\n <span class=\"credit\">\nTAMARA ROSE<\/span><\/figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    <\/div><p><b>C<\/b>OLORADO-RAISED ECO-ACTIVIST and rapper Xiuhtezcatl Martinez is only 15 years old, but he\u2019s already a leading voice in the environmental movement.

Kevin Parker is in bed, and the room is a mess \u2013 empty cans of Tecate litter the tables; underwear, skinny jeans and scarves spill from a suitcase. Hangover cures \u2013 Advil, Tums \u2013 rest on the nightstand. \u201cI like a messy hotel room,\u201d Parker deadpans in his thick Australian accent. \u201cIt\u2019s a little slice of home.\u201d His memory of last night is hazy, but he knows he climbed down from a second-floor balcony at the hotel and ended up in a nearby creek, where he sat on a rock and watched the sunrise. Today, he wants to take it easy: \u201cFucking codeine and <i>South Park.<\/i>\u201d<\/p>\n<p>But it\u2019s the day before Tame Impala\u2019s five-week summer tour kicks off at Austin\u2019s Psych Fest, and Parker, 29, has work to do. So he struggles out of bed and helps his sound man lug laptops and keyboards into his room. They sit at a desk and connect a MIDI keyboard to a Mac, then turn on an oscilloscope machine, a device that measures electrical signals. They\u2019re typically used to check whether a TV or a medical scanner is working, but Parker discovered that if you plug an instrument into one, it produces trippy images. He\u2019s been projecting them on a huge screen during Tame Impala shows ever since.<\/p>\n<p>Some bands hire a production team to handle onstage visuals; Parker does it himself \u2013 along with just about every element of Tame Impala. He played almost every note on the band\u2019s three albums by himself before bringing the songs \u2013 paranoid, self-critical head trips buried in a haze of psychedelic riffs and spaced-out synths \u2013 to the rest of the group to execute live.<\/p>\n<p>The results have been impressive: Tame Impala just played main-stage slots at Coachella and Governors Ball and will headline Radio City Music Hall this fall. Paul McCartney\u2019s a fan, and Mark Ronson has called them his \u201cfavorite rock &amp; roll band.\u201d \u201cSonically, they\u2019re making some of the most exciting albums right now,\u201d says Jack Antonoff of Bleachers and fun. \u201cThey sound like a really exciting blend of future mixed with the early Seventies \u2013 this incredible, bizarre blend.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Parker\u2019s iron grip on his band\u2019s creative process has a downside. He spent months in a Paris apartment making Tame Impala\u2019s 2012 breakthrough, <i>Lonerism<\/i>, a process he calls \u201ctorture.\u201d \u201cI felt like I was going insane,\u201d he adds. \u201cI wasn\u2019t looking after myself, mentally, nutritionally.\u201d He tried to put less pressure on himself for the band\u2019s new album, <i>Currents<\/i>. \u201cBut I wound up falling down completely the same hole again.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>On much of the new album, Parker struggles with an identity crisis; he recorded the album after a breakup and as he chose to embrace life as a young rock star. \u201cI\u2019ve always had these morals I\u2019ve sort of put on myself: that excess is bad,\u201d he says. \u201cI used to be into Buddhism and stuff. I was vegetarian. I was all about shutting things out.\u201d This applies to his music too \u2013 the record trades rock riffs for more electronic and R&amp;B influences. \u201cI grew up in the grunge era,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve always resisted the idea of being part of a machine, wanting just to be an artist in my own right. But at some point I just realized shutting things out took more energy than just letting it in.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Parker\u2019s phone rings; there\u2019s a car waiting to take him to hear the vinyl edition of <i>Currents<\/i> for the first time. As he leaves his room, there\u2019s a note under his door \u2013 a fan in 1212 is wondering if she can get a picture. \u201cThat\u2019s weird,\u201d he says, quieting down when he realizes that room is across from his. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll knock on her door. That\u2019s never happened before!\u201d<\/p>\n<p>A day earlier, Tame Impala stood on an Austin soundstage rehearsing, smoke machines and all. The mood is light \u2013 between songs, a few band members plan a visit to a New Orleans strip club, and Parker sarcastically wonders why some crew members have disappeared around 4:20 p.m. Parker suggests several tweaks to the songs: a little more bass drive during \u201cFeels Like We Always Go Backwards,\u201d and for drummer Julien Barbagallo to play \u201ca little more sensitively\u201d on a new song, \u201cEventually.\u201d When the drummer doesn\u2019t quite get it, Parker takes a seat and demonstrates the part himself.<\/p>\n<p>As the clock approaches 8 p.m. and the band runs out of beer, his tone grows stern. \u201cWe\u2019re running out of fuck-around time,\u201d he says. \u201cLet\u2019s try to play them in a way that doesn\u2019t sound embarrassing.\u201d When multi-instrumentalist Jay Watson suggests they figure out one of his keyboard parts at sound-check tomorrow, Parker barks, \u201cThere is no sound-check. It\u2019s a fucking festival.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t sound like a dick, just a taskmaster, and the band is used to it. \u201cHe always wanted to control every element,\u201d says Watson, who also plays in the Tame Impala offshoot band Pond. \u201cLike how hard I hit the cymbal. It took a few years to be comfortable getting told what to do all the time.\u201d (Watson doesn\u2019t complain about his job: \u201cI get to drink beer midday!\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Parker has always preferred to work alone. He grew up in Perth, a sparkling city on Australia\u2019s west coast that\u2019s one of the most remote metropolises in the world, 2,000 miles from Sydney and Melbourne. He calls himself \u201cessentially an only child.\u201d His parents split up when he was four; he went to live with his mom in the eastern suburbs of Perth, while his brother went to live with his wealthier father, an accountant for a gold-mining company. \u201cI have almost no memory of my parents ever speaking to each other,\u201d he says. \u201cThey split up on bad terms. I assumed that\u2019s what family life was like. Just essentially a soap opera.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>By the time he was 12, Parker was experimenting with multitrack recording. As a teen, he loved the Smashing Pumpkins, Silverchair and even Korn (\u201cI think I had a lot in common with the lead singer. He had kind of family issues\u201d). But Parker calls his first Flaming Lips show a spiritual moment. \u201cIt completely fucked me up,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m really into the way music can affect you, emotionally, spatially. The idea that music can make you feel like you\u2019re not standing with two feet on the ground is really interesting to me.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"\/var\/site_2923\/storage\/images\/media2\/images\/f0019-014\/37824-1-eng-GB\/f0019-012.jpg\" width=\"518\" height=\"415\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0019-01\" title=\"f0019-01\" \/>\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>SICK VISUALS<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Tame Impala onstage at Austin Psych Fest in May.

The house became the center of Perth\u2019s weird, avant-garde psychedelic scene. \u201cWe listened to Sabbath, like, 18 hours a day,\u201d says Watson. They grew a huge weed plant in their backyard. Parker would get high and record kids playing baseball, then distort their voices through delay pedals. \u201cPsychedelic music became a way of life,\u201d says Parker.<\/p>\n<p>Because Perth is so isolated \u2013 \u201cPeople are generally content to just impress the other people in Perth\u201d \u2013 Parker was shocked when he was asked to play shows in Sydney and Melbourne after he put some of his original songs on MySpace in 2007.<\/p>\n<p>In 2010, the band\u2019s first LP, <i>Innerspeaker,<\/i> earned it prime U.K. festival spots, and publications like <i>NME<\/i> started comparing Parker to John Lennon. In fact, Parker has never listened to a full Beatles album \u2013 he\u2019s more likely to play Daft Punk and Timbaland on the bus. Parker decided to embrace those influences on <i>Currents<\/i>, which adds slow-jam falsetto, vocoder and disco beats to their sound. While recording, he listened mostly to Nineties R&amp;B: \u201cAs a teenager I thought I was supposed to hate it.\u201d Between sips of ros\u00e9 at dinner one night in Texas, he spends several minutes talking about the Swedish music producer Max Martin. \u201cHe\u2019s my idol at the moment,\u201d Parker says. He excitedly shares that only McCartney and Lennon have written more Number One hits, and notes that Britney Spears\u2019 \u201c. . . Baby One More Time\u201d was originally written for the Backstreet Boys. He starts singing the chorus: \u201cYou can hear it, right?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s always been my fantasy \u2013 this idea of [being] someone behind the scenes, pulling strings, writing these fucking amazing songs,\u201d he says. \u201cIt gives pop music this intellectual side. It makes it more like a craft. It inspires me.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI SURVIVED,\u201d PARKER SAYS IN THE lobby of Tame Impala\u2019s hotel in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, a month after our Austin meeting. The band is about to play New York\u2019s Governors Ball, the final gig of its U.S. tour. Parker\u2019s wrist is covered in wristbands from other recent festivals. He\u2019s not that impressed with the Gov Ball site. \u201cIt looks similar to a lot of the other festivals we\u2019ve been doing,\u201d he says.<\/p>\n<p>Parker just finished listening to a recording of the previous night\u2019s show in D.C., and he thinks the band has made a lot of progress in the past month. \u201cIt feels like the end of some epic movie.\u201d He can\u2019t wait to get home to Perth to see his girlfriend, an old friend from high school who works in advertising.<\/p>\n<p>The band members eat a late breakfast, and hours later they\u2019re on the festival\u2019s main stage. \u201cHoly shit,\u201d Parker says, gazing at the crowd. As frantic circular projections he designed dance behind him, Parker straps on a Rickenbacker and launches into a roaring Sabbath-like riff. He grows more animated throughout the show, which peaks with the Zombies-like \u201cApocalypse Dreams.\u201d During a drum solo, Parker lifts his guitar over his head and steps onto the drum riser before collapsing to his knees, and then rolls onto his back as he keeps strumming.<\/p>\n<p>Parker says he used to avoid \u201cclassicrock-show moves\u201d like these \u2013 he\u2019d cringe whenever he saw a frontman venture into the crowd to touch the audience. Recently, though, he had a change of heart. \u201cI did it once,\u201d he says, \u201cand all these hands reached out and touched mine, and the looks on their faces was sheer joy. They were happy, they were stoked, and it kind of made their day. Then you have this weird sort of like moral dilemma \u2013 on one hand, it\u2019s a clich\u00e9 rock move, but on the other, you made a lot of people happy for whatever reason. So maybe it\u2019s not such a bad thing.

Their boundless charisma and creative flair have made fans of street-level hustlers and Justin Bieber alike, and their 2014 hit \u201cFight Night\u201d was recently certified gold. But big drama has been hanging over them as they finish their first studio LP, <i>Yung Rich Nation.<\/i> Tonight, the group\u2019s third member \u2013 Quavo\u2019s cousin Off set \u2013 is languishing 200 miles away in a Statesboro, Georgia, jail due to an April incident in which all three were busted on drug and weapons charges. It\u2019s a major complication that couldn\u2019t have come at a worse time. Even so, Quavo shrugs it off: \u201cEverybody gets slapped on the wrist. Off set will be back soon.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>For now, the two free members of Migos have decided to go bowling. A little after 10 p.m., Quavo strolls into a brightly lit alley and rents a couple of lanes, paying the cashier with a bill from the fat roll of hundreds in the back pocket of his skinny gray Balmain jeans. A darkblue T-shirt from Migos\u2019 clothing line, several flashy chains and medallions, a diamond-encrusted Rolex and a large pair of nonprescription Versace eyeglasses complete a look that could be compared to a swagged-out Steve Urkel. Quavo trades in his gray Air Jordans for bowling shoes, chooses a red ball and throws an effortless strike on his first try. \u201cPut that in Rolling Stone!\u201d he crows, kicking off a night in which he bowls with Lebowski-esque grace for two hours, scoring a solid 217.<\/p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"\/var\/site_2923\/storage\/images\/media2\/images\/f0022-02\/37860-1-eng-GB\/f0022-022.jpg\" width=\"236\" height=\"236\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0022-02\" title=\"f0022-02\" \/>\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p>Off set<\/p>\n <span class=\"credit\">\nBEN GRIEME<\/span><\/figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    <\/div><p>Later, back at Migos\u2019 studio, Quavo and Takeoff sink into black leather couches and roll blunts. Quavo exhales a regal puff and jokingly banishes one of their crew from the room: \u201cGet a gold plaque, then you can smoke in here.\u201d But there\u2019s an energy missing from the room without Off -set, who\u2019s been locked up in Statesboro since the group\u2019s April 18th performance. Police arrested all three members, along with about a dozen associates, after allegedly finding less than an ounce of marijuana, some codeine syrup and four handguns in their tour vans. While Quavo and Takeoff were each able to post $10,000 bail, Off set was forced to stay longer due to prior burglary and theft convictions on his rap sheet. The case made new headlines in early May, when Off set was hit with a battery charge after an alleged fight with another inmate. (He has pleaded not guilty.) \u201cOff set\u2019s the animal out the group,\u201d Quavo says. \u201cBut he ain\u2019t no bad guy.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Migos\u2019 lawyers maintain that the weapons were brought to Statesboro by the group\u2019s security, and they question whether the police had any legal grounds to search the vehicles. \u201cI think the entire arrest and the entire prosecution are strictly racially motivated,\u201d says Quavo\u2019s attorney, Cris Schneider. \u201cBoth law enforcement and the prosecutor know that they can\u2019t tie any of that stuff to any of these individuals.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Offset sounds fairly upbeat when he calls me from Statesboro a few days earlier. \u201cI\u2019m chilling,\u201d he says. \u201cI mean, I\u2019m in jail, so there\u2019s not much going on.\u201d He tells me he\u2019s been working out, writing lyrics and talking to his bandmates daily. \u201cWe pray together,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re family. We believe in loyalty.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Around 2 a.m., Quavo steps into a vocal booth and begins spinning cocaine metaphors over a skeletal beat. \u201cMarilyn Manson, Marilyn Manson,\u201d he raps. \u201cKnow some niggas cooking up that Marilyn Manson.\u201d He repeats the lines five or six times, building from a moody mumble to an excited yell. By 3 a.m., with a rough song sketched out, he\u2019s twisting up another blunt in the control room. \u201cShit,\u201d he says. \u201cAll we gotta do is keep making hits and let God judge.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"byline\"><b>SIMON VOZICK-LEVINSON,<\/b><i>Photograph by<\/i> Diwang Valdez<\/p>\n","layout":{},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":0,"link_source":"","competition":[],"flatplan_title":"","notes":"","gutter_credit":"","other":"","image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1467287568.485","name":"f0022-01","source":"","caption":"<p><b>TWO MUSKETEERS<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Quavo (left) and Takeoff<\/p>\n","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http:\/\/cdn-assets.ziniopro.com\/var\/site_2923\/storage\/images\/media2\/images\/f0022-015\/37867-1-eng-GB\/f0022-012.jpg?t=default_ipad_portrait&ext\/f0022-012_default_ipad_portrait.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"768","height":"762","legacy_id":"3960","is_default":true},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1467287568.485","name":"f0022-01","source":"","caption":"<p><b>TWO MUSKETEERS<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Quavo (left) and Takeoff<\/p>\n","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http:\/\/cdn-assets.ziniopro.com\/var\/site_2923\/storage\/images\/media2\/images\/f0022-015\/37867-1-eng-GB\/f0022-012.jpg?t=default_ipad_landscape&ext\/f0022-012_default_ipad_landscape.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"774","height":"768","legacy_id":"3960","is_default":false}],"related_objects":{"image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_1_1467287566.9384","name":"f0022-02","source":"BEN GRIEME","caption":"<p>Off set<\/p>\n","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http:\/\/cdn-assets.ziniopro.com\/var\/site_2923\/storage\/images\/media2\/images\/f0022-02\/37860-1-eng-GB\/f0022-022.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"236","height":"236","legacy_id":"3959"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_1_1467287566.9384","name":"f0022-02","source":"BEN GRIEME","caption":"<p>Off set<\/p>\n","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http:\/\/cdn-assets.ziniopro.com\/var\/site_2923\/storage\/images\/media2\/images\/f0022-02\/37860-1-eng-GB\/f0022-022.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"236","height":"236","legacy_id":"3959"}]},"url_alias":"http:\/\/site-2923.audiencemedia.com","type":"story","order":"13","folio_number":"22","folio_numbers":"22","pdf_page_index":"22","thumbnail":"http:\/\/cdn-assets.ziniopro.com\/var\/site_2923\/storage\/images\/media2\/images\/f0022-015\/37867-1-eng-GB\/f0022-012.jpg?t=tablet_story_thumbnail&ext\/f0022-012_tablet_story_thumbnail.jpg","color":"FFFFFF","real_id":"3958","main_section_id":"154","ads":[]},{"id":"zinio_28_100340926_1467287571.4939","title":"James Taylor","sub_title":"","author":[{"id":"0","name":"Andy Greene","email":"noreply@audiencemedia.com","is_default":false}],"tag":"","strap_line":"MY LIFE IN 15 SONGS","intro":"Addiction, absent fathers and survival: The surprisingly dark stories behind some folk-rock classics","body":"<p class=\"byline\">By Andy Greene<\/p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"\/var\/site_2923\/storage\/images\/media2\/images\/f0023-016\/37924-1-eng-GB\/f0023-012.jpg\" width=\"765\" height=\"1161\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0023-01\" title=\"f0023-01\" \/>\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>FROZEN MAN<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Taylor at the Newport Folk Festival, 1969<\/p>\n <span class=\"credit\">\n\u00a9 BARON WOLMAN\/ICONIC IMAGES.<\/span><\/figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    <\/div><p><b>J<\/b>AMES TAYLOR\u2019S NEW ALBUM, <i>Before This World,<\/i> is his first collection of original songs in 13 years, though he wasn\u2019t exactly taking it easy during that stretch \u2013 he toured regularly, released live and cover albums, and helped raise twin boys, now 14. But a few years ago, Taylor realized that he needed to make songwriting a top priority in his life if he was ever going to release another album of new songs. So he borrowed a friend\u2019s apartment and camped out to write what would become <i>Before This World,<\/i> a sweet, reflective disc that evokes memories of his classic 1970s albums. \u201cI\u2019m not the type of musician who reinvents himself over and over again,\u201d he says. \u201cI am a slow evolution of a style of recording and writing, and I do think that in ways I get better at it.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>At 67, Taylor is able to look back honestly on his life and career, including the darker moments \u2013 from his heroin addiction to his struggles as a parent (he fathered two children, Sally, 41, and singer-songwriter Ben, 38, with ex-wife Carly Simon). \u201cSally and Ben turned out brilliantly,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I can\u2019t take much credit for them. I was a pretty compromised father. Addiction is delayed development, so I may have been late in becoming an adult.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Sitting in a luxury suite at Fenway Park before his beloved Boston Red Sox took on the New York Yankees one recent evening, Taylor walked us through 50 years of songwriting, going all the way back to getting signed to Apple Records by the Beatles in 1968.<\/p>\n<h3><b>Rainy Day Man 1967<\/b><\/h3><p>In 1966, I was living at the Albert Hotel in New York with my best friend, Zach Wiesner, who wrote this song with me. We had one of two rooms at the hotel that hadn\u2019t been destroyed in a fire, so it was pretty cheap.<\/p>\n<p>The \u201crainy day man\u201d was a dope connection. I had taken my first opiate in 1966. Joel \u201cBishop\u201d O\u2019Brien, the drummer in the Flying Machine, was an addict. I spent a lot of time at his apartment, so it was just a matter of time before I tried heroin. I was pretty much born to shoot dope \u2013 it was the key to my lock, so I really was gone for the next 20 years.<\/p>\n<p class=\"pullQuote\"><b> \u201cThe \u2018rainy day man\u2019 was a dope connection.

He was right: I was strung out, malnourished and kind of beat. He arrived the next day with the family station wagon and drove me back to North Carolina, where I had grown up. I took time to recover, and around Christmas 1967 I talked my parents into buying me a ticket to London, where I had a friend who agreed to put me up for a few weeks.<\/p>\n<p>I was hoping to sing in clubs or even on the streets, but I ended up getting in touch with Peter Asher, who had just started working for Apple Records. He got me an audition with Paul McCartney and George Harrison, where I played them this song. Paul said to Peter, \u201cYou feel like producing this guy?\u201d And Peter said, \u201cYeah.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The song is about an early girlfriend and the calm you feel in the presence of someone who knows you really well.

I realized how lucky I was to be listening to the Beatles playbacks and watching their process in the studio, but at the same time that I was surrounded by this holy host of my absolute idols, I missed my home in North Carolina. This captured that feeling of being called away to an other place.<\/p>\n<h3><b>Sweet Baby James 1970<\/b><\/h3><p>Allen Klein took over Apple Records in 1969. We had it in our contract that we could audit him to see what our sales were, and he didn\u2019t want anybody looking at the books, so he let us go. In fact, he let everybody on the label go except the Beat les.<\/p>\n<p>I came back to the States and found out my brother Alex had had a kid. I decided to write a song for the baby boy, who was named after me. A little cowboy song. It starts as a lullaby, then the second half of the song \u2013 \u201cthe turnpike from Stockbridge to Boston . . .\u201d \u2013 talks about what music means to me. It gets pretty spiritual by the end. I think it\u2019s my best song.<\/p>\n<h3><b>Steamroller 1970<\/b><\/h3><p>I came back from London with my heroin habit raging again, so I went to rehab. Well, it wasn\u2019t rehab. It was a psychiatric facility in Stockbridge, Massachusetts. I\u2019d been in a psychiatric hospital when I was 17, and I think that\u2019s just what my folks knew to do with me. This facility wasn\u2019t meant to handle opiate rehab, but that\u2019s where I went, and I wrote a lot of songs that wound up on <i>Sweet Baby James<\/i> there.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cSteamroller,\u201d however, was from my Flying Machine days, and it was a joke. There were a lot of white guys playing the blues, college students singing Howlin\u2019 Wolf and Muddy Waters, and it seemed comical to me. \u201cSteamroller\u201d was just meant to be a takeoff .<\/p>\n<p>One of the effects of being hospitalized a couple of times is that any expectations my family might have had for me \u2013 academic or professional \u2013 had all been abandoned. They kinda threw up their hands and said, \u201cWell, at least he\u2019s still alive.\u201d They were always very supportive of my music, but I did feel as though I came from a place of being disenfranchised and alienated. So while seeing <i>Sweet Baby James<\/i> take off was hugely gratifying and everything I wanted, success was a major adjustment.<\/p>\n<h3><b>You\u2019ve Got a Friend 1971<\/b><\/h3><p>Carole King and I were playing the Troubadour in Los Angeles together.

It\u2019s probably typical, but I have a sense that he was emotionally sort of frozen. \u201cWalking Man\u201d is informed by my longing for him. He disappeared for a few years when I was seven, eight and nine. He was drafted into the Navy, and then he volunteered to go to the South Pole. We missed him a lot. My mother was a daughter of a Yankee fisherman. She had five kids born within six years in the countryside of North Carolina, and here she was waiting for her husband to come home. That always stayed with me, somehow.<\/p>\n<h3><b>A Junkie\u2019s Lament 1976<\/b><\/h3><p>I\u2019ve got a lot of recovery songs. This one\u2019s a warning not to think of a junkie as a complete functioning human being. Heroin should\u2019ve killed me about five times, but it never did. My kids suffered from their father being an addict. I think there\u2019s no way they can\u2019t.<\/p>\n<p>People take drugs to be in control. They want to short-circuit any risk that they might take in life, any uncertainty, any anxiety. They just want to find the chemical route, to just push the button that gets the final result. So all of your relationships suffer, no question about it.<\/p>\n<h3><b>Secret o\u2019 Life 1977<\/b><\/h3><p>I wrote this in a little patch of sunlight while sitting on the stairs of a house I was literally building on Martha\u2019s Vineyard. It took me about 10 minutes. It\u2019s as though the song was just sitting there in the guitar. There aren\u2019t many that come that easily.<\/p>\n<p>One line goes, \u201cThe secret of life is enjoying the passage of time.\u201d It\u2019s a preposterous thing to write about, and so the title was supposed to recall Life Savers flavors \u2013 Pep-O-Mint or But-O-Rum. It\u2019s a jab at the presumptuousness of writing a song called \u201cThe Secret of Life.\u201d<\/p>\n<h3><b>Only a Dream in Rio 1985<\/b><\/h3><p>I had gone into yet another rehab, to kick methadone after a couple of really nasty \u201cjackpots,\u201d which is where you humiliate yourself and the people who love you by fucking up. I tried to detox at a place in Connecticut, but I fell back and continued to use. It wasn\u2019t until [saxophonist] Michael Brecker got me involved with the Twelve Steps that I got serious. But even after I got clean, I didn\u2019t know whether there was life on the other side of addiction for me. I wasn\u2019t sure I could write anymore, either.<\/p>\n<p>Then I went down to Rio de Janeiro to play the Rock in Rio festival. [Brazilian songwriter] Gilberto Gil had left a guitar for me to play. I walked onstage, and 300,000 people knew my songs. They have this tradition of singing along in Brazil that is so loud, so strong, and so in tune and so in time, it\u2019s sort of like when they pick up a song that they know and sing it back to you, it\u2019s extremely powerful. So I was, like, two feet off the ground coming off the stage, really felt as though I had landed on my feet. It was a turning point in my life.<\/p>\n<h3><b>Never Die Young 1988<\/b><\/h3><p>This song is written from the point of view of someone who has given up and is looking at the lives of two young people who aren\u2019t caught up in the morass of life as the narrator knows it: \u201cLet other hearts be broken\/Let other dreams run dry\/Let our golden ones sail onto another land beneath another sky.\u201d It\u2019s a sad song, but also hopeful and celebratory.<\/p>\n<h3><b>Copperline 1991<\/b><\/h3><p>This is another song about home, about my father, about a childhood that was very peaceful, which is a rare thing today. I felt like I was part of a landscape in those days \u2013 the trees, the streams and the rivers, the animals that lived there.<\/p>\n<p>[My wife] Kim and I are raising our kids in the countryside, but it is not the country life that I experienced. It\u2019s connected, constantly connected. Sometimes I feel as though the little snippets of information that we\u2019re always receiving are preparing us to have a hive mind. There may come a point where we basically have a communal mind, which is an exciting prospect.<\/p>\n<h3><b>Enough to Be on Your Way 1997<\/b><\/h3><p>My brother Alex was also an addict, and in 1993, he died of it. There was a sense of relief when he died, for him and for his family, that one felt. It wasn\u2019t until a year or so had passed that I got back in touch with the totality of his life rather than just the shambles of its end, the pain of it. That\u2019s when I wrote this song.<\/p>\n<h3><b>Mean Old Man 2002<\/b><\/h3><p>This one was a big accomplishment, because it\u2019s a sophisticated song and a throwback. Paul McCartney called me up and said that when he\u2019d first heard it, he assumed it was Frank Loesser or Cole Porter. I was, of course, absolutely thrilled. At one point, Bob Dylan told me that he\u2019d been listening to [Taylor\u2019s song] \u201cFrozen Man\u201d and really thought it was great, and that\u2019s enough for me. Ten critics can savage me, but I\u2019ll be fine as long as every once in a while, someone like Bob Dylan or Paul McCartney says, \u201cKeep going, kid.\u201d<\/p>\n<h3><b>Angels of Fenway 2015<\/b><\/h3><p>I finished this in May 2014, but I had the music for about seven years before that. I knew that I wanted to write about this miracle 2004 season against the Yankees. If you\u2019re a Red Sox fan, or even just a baseball fan, it was an amazing event. I cast it as a grandmother who was born the last time the Red Sox won, and she dies on the day they finally do it again.<\/p>\n","layout":{},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":0,"link_source":"","competition":[],"flatplan_title":"","notes":"","gutter_credit":"","other":"","image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1467287577.9247","name":"f0023-01","source":"\u00a9

America.<\/p>\n <span class=\"credit\">\nSTEPHEN VOSS\/REDUX<\/span><\/figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    <\/div><p><b>L<\/b>AST YEAR, TA-NEHISI COATES wrote \u201cThe Case for Reparations,\u201d a painstakingly researched <i>Atlantic<\/i> cover story that confirmed him as one of the 21st century\u2019s most important writers on race. For his new book, <i>Between the World and Me,<\/i> he shifted tactics, exploring the impact of racist violence in America through an extraordinary blend of memoir and history. \u201cI wanted to think about the problem from a more literary perspective,\u201d says Coates, 39. \u201cI really wanted to make something beautiful.\u201d The book is especially timely this summer: Its release was moved up from September to July after the killings in Charleston, South Carolina, in June.<\/p>\n<p><i>James Baldwin is one of the clearest influences on your writing in this book. When did you first read his work?<\/i><\/p>\n<p>I have this fond memory of college \u2013 my time was unrestricted. I remember sitting in a library at Howard University and reading <i>The Fire Next Time<\/i> in one session. It was such a pleasurable experience, to be lost in a work of art. And in this age, where the Internet is ubiquitous, it\u2019s very hard to have that experience. I had this vision of some 19-year-old kid in a library somewhere, picking this book up and disappearing for a while. That was all I wanted.<\/p>\n<p><i>One phrase that recurs throughout is \u201cthe Dream\u201d: the idea that America needs to wake up from the false dream of race. How did you come to that theme?<\/i><\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s subverting the notion of the American Dream, subverting Martin Luther King\u2019s rendition of \u201cI have a dream.\u201d I wanted to do something a little darker. It\u2019s no different than these movies where they say it\u2019s a darker version of some comicbook story. This is very much the same thing.<\/p>\n<p><i>How much has hip-hop informed your writing?<\/i><\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s the biggest influence on my aesthetic. One of the constant questions I get is \u201cWhy are you so depressing? What about hope?\u201d But hope is not very important in hip-hop. Hope has very little to do with Mobb Deep. That shaped me a lot.<\/p>\n<p><i>Do you find something positive in exploring that darkness, even if it\u2019s not hopeful?<\/i><\/p>\n<p>There\u2019s hope in there. But it\u2019s not a bowl of sugar. It\u2019s dark chocolate. It\u2019s a little bitter. And that\u2019s how it\u2019s supposed to be. I think hope that\u2019s not cut with some sense of struggle is false. I\u2019m not a fucking politician! I don\u2019t have to make people feel good at the end of the book.<\/p>\n<p><i> \u201cForgiveness\u201d is a word that\u2019s been thrown around since Charleston. What do you think of that concept?<\/i><\/p>\n<p>I think it would be good if the country was as forgiving of the folks who were upset down in Ferguson; if the country was as forgiving of the people who were upset down in Baltimore; if the country was as forgiving of the millions of people who find themselves incarcerated in this country because of some mistake they made when they were young.

   \n    <\/div><p><b>J<\/b>ASON ISBELL FELT A RUSH OF familiarity when he watched the final episode of <i>Mad Men<\/i> on his tour bus. As he saw Don Draper go AWOL from his advertising job and embark on an aimless cross-country road trip, Isbell recalled his own life around 2008, after his first marriage had fallen apart and he\u2019d been fired from the Drive-By Truckers due largely to his heavy drinking. Isbell bought a motorcycle and took off from his home in Alabama. \u201cI drove down to Florida, back up through Georgia and visited some of the girls I had met on the road,\u201d he says in a husky Alabama drawl. \u201cIt\u2019s a wonder I didn\u2019t kill myself. I got home feeling and looking worse than when I\u2019d left, just completely lost.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Isbell eventually went to rehab and turned his dark past into some of the best music to come out of Nashville this decade. On 2013\u2019s <i>Southeastern,<\/i> he reflected on cocaine nights at Super 8\u2019s, mistreating vulnerable women, and starting over. \u201cI was behaving in a way that was deplorable on a lot of levels,\u201d Isbell says, drinking Red Bull and smoking cigarettes on his tour bus, outside the Capitol Theatre in Portchester, New York, one recent afternoon. \u201cThe problem with drinking is you can drown out your conscience until it shuts up.\u201d Bruce Springsteen called <i>Southeastern<\/i> a \u201clovely record\u201d and sneaked up on Isbell at a Dr. John benefit to sing Isbell\u2019s song \u201cTraveling Alone\u201d into his ear. Isbell sold out four consecutive shows at Nashville\u2019s Ryman Auditorium in October.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m kind of picky about songwriters, you know,\u201d says John Prine. \u201cBut when I heard <i>Southeastern,<\/i> it just killed me. I loved it. I like songs that are clean and don\u2019t have much fat on them \u2013 every line is direct, and all people can relate to it. That\u2019s what I try to do, and that\u2019s what Jason does. I really haven\u2019t heard anybody that different in probably 30 years.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Old ghosts still exist on Isbell\u2019s new album, <i>Something More Than Free,<\/i> like an ex-lover who spills unflattering stories about Isbell to his wife. But Isbell finds more material in the common truths of the overworked and underprivileged people of the rural South \u2013 truck loaders, railroad workers, housewives. \u201cI don\u2019t think on why I\u2019m here or where it hurts\/I\u2019m just lucky to have the work,\u201d he declares on the title track, which he wrote partly about his father, a retired house painter. \u201cPhysical labor, manual labor \u2013 if you can stay close to those folks, there\u2019s always plenty to write about, \u2019cause their issues are real issues.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Isbell grew up in the low-income town of Green Hill, Alabama. \u201cPeople came to school [just] to eat lunch,\u201d he says. Green Hill is 20 miles from Muscle Shoals, where Aretha Franklin, Etta James, Percy Sledge and others did some of their best work. As a teenage guitarist, Isbell got to know many of the musicians on those records while sitting in at bars with bassist David Hood and organist Spooner Oldham.<\/p>\n<p>As a student at the University of Memphis, Isbell made up songs to entertain his frat brothers and read original verse at poetry readings. One night, Isbell sat in with the Drive-By Truckers, a hard-living band led by Hood\u2019s son Patterson. The Truckers invited Isbell to join as a full member, and he left on tour with them just two days later, becoming the third great voice in the group after Hood and Mike Cooley, who had just completed <i>Southern Rock Opera,<\/i> a concept album about Lynyrd Skynyrd. Isbell boiled down complex ideas into novelistic songs like \u201cDecoration Day,\u201d a devastating chronicle of family\/neighbor turmoil, and \u201cDanko\/Manuel,\u201d in which he compared his demons to those of two fallen members of the Band.<\/p>\n<p>Isbell had no problem adapting to the Truckers\u2019 lifestyle. He would wake up and start drinking, finishing off a fifth of Jack Daniel\u2019s by the end of a show. \u201cWe were lucky if we could walk off the stage,\u201d he says flatly. \u201cI\u2019d wake up in a lot of pain and not know where I was \u2013 some girl\u2019s house somewhere.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Isbell married bassist Shonna Tucker in 2002 after, he says, she saved his life one drunken night (she joined the band a year later). But the honeymoon didn\u2019t last long. \u201cI slept with people I shouldn\u2019t have slept with,\u201d he says. \u201cI started going outside the marriage.\u201d They separated \u2013 sort of. \u201cWe were still in the band together, and so we were only separated by the distance between those two bunks,\u201d he says. \u201cShe didn\u2019t deserve that, but I shouldn\u2019t have married her in the first place.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The toxic environment \u2013 combined with Isbell\u2019s explosive temper at the time \u2013 was too much for Hood and Cooley, who fired Isbell in 2007. (They\u2019ve reconciled.) Isbell burned more bridges, lost more friends and recorded two albums with his band the 400 Unit. In 2011, he started seeing Amanda Shires, an old friend who had played fiddle and guitar with everyone from the Texas Playboys to Todd Snider. She had little tolerance for his excuses: \u201cI told somebody in her presence, \u2018I don\u2019t drink in the morning,\u2019 and she said, \u2018Your morning is one in the afternoon. And you do drink at one in the afternoon.\u2019 \u201d Shires and friend Ryan Adams convinced Isbell to go to rehab. \u201cRehab is like a divorce,\u201d he says. \u201cThe divorce isn\u2019t nearly as sad or shitty as the two or three years leading up to it.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>After sobering up, Isbell started reading \u201cbig, thick books,\u201d including Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez\u2019s <i>100 Years of Solitude,<\/i> Eleanor Catton\u2019s <i>The Luminaries<\/i> and Cormac McCarthy\u2019s <i>Blood Meridian<\/i> \u2013 and dedicated six to eight hours a day to writing songs full of aphorisms like \u201cThere\u2019s one thing that\u2019s real clear to me\/No one dies with dignity\u201d and \u201cIs your brother on a church kick?\/Seems like just a different kind of dope sick.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cA lot of people in Nashville think that the best song is the catchiest, or the one that sells the most copies,\u201d he says at one point. \u201cThey\u2019re editing songs in a way that make them seem more consumable, I guess. I\u2019m trying to edit them in a way that makes them more honest.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>One of those songs is a new single, \u201c24 Frames,\u201d a searing account about how loss can upend one\u2019s world. \u201cI still have the problem of thinking I\u2019m in control of things I\u2019m not in control of,\u201d he says. \u201cNo matter what you thought your plans were, that\u2019s not how things are going to work out, and that\u2019s the only way you can really, I think, live successfully.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Isbell takes a long drag off his last cigarette and cracks another Red Bull. \u201cWith karma too, it\u2019s like, \u2018What have I done to deserve this?\u2019 That\u2019s always the wrong question. It doesn\u2019t matter. The only right question is \u2018What do I do now?\u2019 That\u2019s it.\u201d<\/p>\n","layout":{},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":0,"link_source":"","competition":[],"flatplan_title":"","notes":"","gutter_credit":"","other":"","image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1467287590.8979","name":"f0030-01","source":"DAVID MCCLISTER","caption":"<p><b>CLEAR EYES, FULL HEART<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Isbell in Nashville this year<\/p>\n","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http:\/\/cdn-assets.ziniopro.com\/var\/site_2923\/storage\/images\/media2\/images\/f0030-017\/38075-1-eng-GB\/f0030-012.jpg?t=default_ipad_portrait&ext\/f0030-012_default_ipad_portrait.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"768","height":"887","legacy_id":"3984","is_default":true},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1467287590.8979","name":"f0030-01","source":"DAVID MCCLISTER","caption":"<p><b>CLEAR EYES, FULL HEART<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Isbell in Nashville this year<\/p>\n","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http:\/\/cdn-assets.ziniopro.com\/var\/site_2923\/storage\/images\/media2\/images\/f0030-017\/38075-1-eng-GB\/f0030-012.jpg?t=default_ipad_landscape&ext\/f0030-012_default_ipad_landscape.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"665","height":"768","legacy_id":"3984","is_default":false}],"url_alias":"http:\/\/site-2923.audiencemedia.com","type":"story","order":"18","folio_number":"30","folio_numbers":"30,31","pdf_page_index":"30","thumbnail":"http:\/\/cdn-assets.ziniopro.com\/var\/site_2923\/storage\/images\/media2\/images\/f0030-017\/38075-1-eng-GB\/f0030-012.jpg?t=tablet_story_thumbnail&ext\/f0030-012_tablet_story_thumbnail.jpg","color":"FFFFFF","real_id":"3983","main_section_id":"154","ads":[]},{"id":"zinio_28_100340926_1467287592.5899","title":"The Triumphant Second Life of a Cult Comedy","sub_title":"","author":[{"id":"0","name":"ANDY GREENE","email":"noreply@audiencemedia.com","is_default":false}],"tag":"","strap_line":"HOT SHOW","intro":"How \u2018Wet Hot American Summer\u2019 went from box-office flop to Netflix series","body":"\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"\/var\/site_2923\/storage\/images\/media2\/images\/f0031-012\/38111-1-eng-GB\/f0031-012.jpg\" width=\"668\" height=\"432\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0031-01\" title=\"f0031-01\" \/>\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>WETTER, HOTTER<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Amy Poehler and Bradley Cooper in the <i>Wet Hot<\/i> TV series<\/p>\n <span class=\"credit\">\nSAEED ADYANI\/NETFLIX<\/span><\/figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    <\/div><p><b>I<\/b>N THE SUMMER OF 2001, A LOW-budget summer-camp comedy called <i>Wet Hot American Summer<\/i> hit theaters. Despite featuring a spate of future stars \u2013 including Bradley Cooper, Amy Poehler, Elizabeth Banks and Paul Rudd \u2013 the movie grossed less than $300,000 and was torn to shreds by critics.<\/p>\n<p>But just as it seemed like <i>Wet Hot American Summer<\/i> would be forgotten forever, young people everywhere fell in love with it.

The film takes place on the last day of camp in 1981, but the show takes place entirely on the opening day that same summer. Many cast members are now in their forties, but most portray teenagers. \u201cIt adds a layer of comedy,\u201d says Wain. \u201cYou\u2019re only aware of it for the first couple of minutes of the show.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The show manages to be even more ridiculous than the movie, with a complex plot involving an undercover government assassin, an Israeli soccer coach and the origin story of the talking vegetable can from the film. \u201cWhen the dust settles, we\u2019ll think about whether [we want to make another season],\u201d says Wain. \u201cSummer camp was a defining experience in my life, so I\u2019m not surprised that there tend to be more places to go there.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"byline\"><b>ANDY GREENE<\/b><\/p>\n","layout":{},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":0,"link_source":"","competition":[],"flatplan_title":"","notes":"","gutter_credit":"","other":"","image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1467287593.7536","name":"f0031-01","source":"SAEED ADYANI\/NETFLIX","caption":"<p><b>WETTER, HOTTER<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Amy Poehler and Bradley Cooper in the <i>Wet Hot<\/i> TV series<\/p>\n","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http:\/\/cdn-assets.ziniopro.com\/var\/site_2923\/storage\/images\/media2\/images\/f0031-012\/38111-1-eng-GB\/f0031-012.jpg?t=default_ipad_portrait&ext\/f0031-012_default_ipad_portrait.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"768","height":"497","legacy_id":"3988","is_default":true},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1467287593.7536","name":"f0031-01","source":"SAEED ADYANI\/NETFLIX","caption":"<p><b>WETTER, HOTTER<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Amy Poehler and Bradley Cooper in the <i>Wet Hot<\/i> TV series<\/p>\n","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http:\/\/cdn-assets.ziniopro.com\/var\/site_2923\/storage\/images\/media2\/images\/f0031-012\/38111-1-eng-GB\/f0031-012.jpg?t=default_ipad_landscape&ext\/f0031-012_default_ipad_landscape.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"1024","height":"662","legacy_id":"3988","is_default":false}],"related_objects":{"image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_1_1467287592.8237","name":"f0031-02","source":"GEMMA LA MANA\/NETFLIX","caption":"<p>Rudd and Marguerite Moreau<\/p>\n","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http:\/\/cdn-assets.ziniopro.com\/var\/site_2923\/storage\/images\/media2\/images\/f0031-02\/38104-1-eng-GB\/f0031-022.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"253","height":"315","legacy_id":"3987"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_1_1467287592.8237","name":"f0031-02","source":"GEMMA LA MANA\/NETFLIX","caption":"<p>Rudd and Marguerite Moreau<\/p>\n","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http:\/\/cdn-assets.ziniopro.com\/var\/site_2923\/storage\/images\/media2\/images\/f0031-02\/38104-1-eng-GB\/f0031-022.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"253","height":"315","legacy_id":"3987"}]},"url_alias":"http:\/\/site-2923.audiencemedia.com","type":"story","order":"19","folio_number":"31","folio_numbers":"31","pdf_page_index":"31","thumbnail":"http:\/\/cdn-assets.ziniopro.com\/var\/site_2923\/storage\/images\/media2\/images\/f0031-012\/38111-1-eng-GB\/f0031-012.jpg?t=tablet_story_thumbnail&ext\/f0031-012_tablet_story_thumbnail.jpg","color":"FFFFFF","real_id":"3986","main_section_id":"154","ads":[]},{"id":"zinio_28_100340926_1467287595.4986","title":"Tom Petty Kick-Starts Mudcrutch Once More","sub_title":"","author":[{"id":"0","name":"ANDY GREENE","email":"noreply@audiencemedia.com","is_default":false}],"tag":"","strap_line":"CHECKING IN","intro":"Singer cuts new album with his pre-Heartbreakers crew and opens up his vault","body":"\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"\/var\/site_2923\/storage\/images\/media2\/images\/f0032-017\/38140-1-eng-GB\/f0032-012.jpg\" width=\"411\" height=\"561\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0032-01\" title=\"f0032-01\" \/>\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>BIG MUDDY<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Petty onstage in 2014<\/p>\n <span class=\"credit\">\nC FLANIGAN\/FILMMAGIC<\/span><\/figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    <\/div><p><b>I<\/b>T\u2019S BEEN SEVEN YEARS SINCE TOM Petty reassembled Mudcrutch, the short-lived band he formed in the early Seventies, years before finding fame with the Heartbreakers. Mudcrutch\u2019s self-titled 2008 debut ranks among Petty\u2019s best recent work. Now, he\u2019s readying a second Mudcrutch set. \u201cI\u2019ve spent the last month frantically working on material,\u201d Petty says, noting he has four songs that he\u2019s happy with. \u201cThe good thing about Mudcrutch is that everyone brings in a song, so I don\u2019t have to write 12 or something. Following up the last one is intimidating because I think that\u2019s one of the better albums I was ever involved with.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Mudcrutch originally featured drummer Randall Marsh and rhythm guitarist Tom Leadon (brother of founding Eagles guitarist Bernie Leadon) alongside two future Heartbreakers, guitarist Mike Campbell and keyboard player Benmont Tench. The band first got together in 1970 in Petty\u2019s hometown of Gainesville, Florida, then moved to Los Angeles, where it broke up in 1975 after releasing just one single.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a totally different thing than the Heartbreakers,\u201d says Petty. \u201cIt\u2019s a different rhythm section and a different style of music. I play bass, which is a lot of fun for me, since I started out as a bass player. And Tommy is just out of sight on guitar. We spent our teenage years singing together, so we have a good blend.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The first Mudcrutch album was recorded in only two weeks. The group plans a similar straight-ahead process when it reconvenes in a Los Angeles studio later this summer to hammer out new material. Mudcrutch played a handful of successful California club dates in 2008, but this time out Petty hopes they\u2019ll tour more extensively.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019d love to get to the East Coast with it, too,\u201d he says. \u201cLast time, we were under the gun because we had a big Heartbreakers tour coming up. Right now, I\u2019m just writing, and I need to change my mindset from the Heartbreakers to that kind of music.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Petty thrilled fans two years ago when he played a series of theater shows in New York and Los Angeles packed with rarities and covers. \u201cIt changed my whole way of thinking about playing live,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019d love to do more theater shows, but it\u2019s complicated business-wise. I don\u2019t know for sure, but I would bet it costs us money.

The film premiered at Sundance in January, earning a jury award and making Powley the It girl of the festival circuit.<\/p>\n<p>At 13, she starred in <i>M.I. High<\/i>, a popular U.K. kids show, but she didn\u2019t see herself pursuing an acting career.

The show is Adult Swim\u2019s <i>Rick and Morty<\/i>, an animated sci-fi sitcom that\u2019s loosely based on <i>Back to the Future<\/i> and may be the best-written comedy on TV. In just 11 episodes, the show has become a ratings hit: All told, 9 million people watched Season One, and its fans include Matt Groening, who had Roiland and Harmon create a <i>Rick and Morty<\/i> couch gag for this season\u2019s finale of <i>The Simpsons<\/i>.<\/p>\n<p><i>Rick and Morty<\/i> chronicles the interdimensional adventures of an alcoholic, misanthropic scientific genius (Rick) and his bighearted, dimwitted, chronically nervous grandson (Morty). With the show finally resuming after a 15-month gap, its creators are a bit nervous. The first new episode, Harmon confesses, \u201cwent off the deep end conceptually. We\u2019re pretty convinced it might be the worst episode.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>If that\u2019s true, the pair have nothing to worry about. The episode begins with Rick freezing time for six months to clean up the house after a wild party. But due to an unforeseen complication, time keeps splitting into multiple simultaneous realities. The viewer\u2019s screen splits into as many as 24 tiny frames, each with a slightly different version of the protagonists working to repair the rift.<\/p>\n<p>Does this seem hard to follow? Welcome to the Michio Kaku world of <i>Rick and Morty<\/i>. \u201cI consider it my job to service the insanity,\u201d Harmon says, referring to Roiland, who voices Rick and Morty. \u201cI love the idea of serving the crazy guy instead of being the crazy guy.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Harmon has a reputation as a difficult genius. He\u2019s one of the few people who can create a great show and then get fired from it, as he did from <i>Community<\/i> and <i>The Sarah Silverman Program<\/i>. \u201cI forget my pain,\u201d he says. \u201cI just move from one thing to the next. If I remembered my pain, I\u2019d stop working.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Rick and Morty\u2019s origins lie in a monthly short-film festival called Channel 101, which Harmon co-founded. It was there that Roiland debuted a \u201cDoc and Mharti\u201d short, which involved a mad scientist getting a young boy to lick his balls every time they encounter a problem.<\/p>\n<p>Unsurprisingly, Roiland\u2019s sensibility made it difficult to sell shows to network TV. He pitched network executives nonstop for 10 years, with little luck. So when Adult Swim asked Harmon to make a pilot, he decided to work on making Roiland\u2019s humor palatable to a broader audience: \u201cThe challenge was, how do you make my mom understand how funny it is to see somebody vomiting diarrhea?\u201d Harmon glances at his partner. \u201cNot to pigeonhole Justin\u2019s sensibility.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"byline\"><b>NEIL STRAUSS<\/b><\/p>\n","layout":{},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":0,"link_source":"","competition":[],"flatplan_title":"","notes":"","gutter_credit":"","other":"","image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1467287600.2807","name":"f0033-01","source":"ADULT SWIM","caption":"<p><b>GREAT SCOTT!<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Above: Rick (right) and Morty.

If you look at something like <i>Forgetting Sarah Marshall,<\/i> there\u2019s a lot of sadness in that character.<\/p>\n<p><b>Or even that tragic failed drum audition in<\/b><i><b>Freaks and Geeks<\/b><\/i>.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s like the worst nightmare, right? To find out that you\u2019re medium talent.<\/p>\n<p><b>Why were you seeking a part like this?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>There was a natural transition going on. I had arrived in my thirties, and <i>How I Met Your Mother,<\/i> which I had done for almost a decade, was coming to an end. There\u2019s a scene toward the end of this movie where Wallace says, \u201cIt\u2019s time for me to acknowledge the reality that I\u2019m 34 years old, alone in a room with a piece of paper.\u201d And I was coming out of a long tunnel of movies and TV shows into the unknown, and so I really related to that.<\/p>\n<p><i><b>Mother<\/b><\/i><b>took up so much of your time for so long \u2013 did its absence lead to a lot of introspection?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>There was a repetitive cycle for about 10 years. I would be doing the TV show and also writing the movie that I would do during the hiatus and then filming that. There wasn\u2019t a lot of opportunity to think about doing something different. Then all of a sudden, I had the chance to think about what I wanted the next 50 years of my life to be like.<\/p>\n<p><b>Bob Odenkirk sometimes gets funny takes out of his system before he gets serious \u2013 did you try that?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>I was too scared to try funny takes! In a movie this size, you really don\u2019t have the time or the film \u2013 literally the film \u2013 to ease yourself in. And I didn\u2019t want it to ever feel like, \u201cNow watch Jason Segel try dramatic acting!\u201d<\/p>\n<p><b>How did you incorporate your knowledge of Wallace\u2019s eventual suicide into the performance?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s a good question, because you have some options on how to play it. What really hit me is I don\u2019t know what\u2019s gonna happen to me, to Jason Segel, tomorrow. So I tried to play it as much in the moment as possible, and not try to indicate the eventuality of it. At the same time, during the movie, things are going as well as they can go for him, and underneath it all is this terrifying moment we can all relate to: What happens when things are going well and it still doesn\u2019t satisfy this sort of deep feeling that we\u2019re not enough?<\/p>\n<p><b>Do you want to leave comedy behind?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>What\u2019s interesting to me right now are things like <i>End of Tour<\/i> that explore complicated feelings. There\u2019s room to do everything, but I\u2019m also aware, after doing this for 17 years, that people want more of what they\u2019re familiar with you doing \u2013 so I want to spend a little bit of time getting people familiar with this type of performance.<\/p>\n<p><b>Your friends Paul Rudd and Cobie Smulders are both in Marvel movies. Would you consider that?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s not something I\u2019m seeking out, but there are actually a few comic-book characters that I find incredibly interesting \u2013 I would never throw the names out because then they\u2019ll get snatched away from me.<\/p>\n<p><b>Are you up for the getting-super-ripped part?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Yeah, of course. But it\u2019s unbelievable \u2013 you have, like, really complicated, sensitive artists treating themselves like UFC fighters.

But it\u2019s fair to say we miss him already, because his America is gone. The political climate \u2013 angrier, more bitter, more violently divided \u2013 is radically different from the one he signed up to make fun of. Political satire, as Stewart defined it on <i>The Daily Show,<\/i> requires him to appear equally tough on the left and the right. But that means he has to pretend there\u2019s such a thing as a moderate center.<\/p>\n<p><b>The Daily Show<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Weeknights, 11 p.m.,<\/p>\n<p>Comedy Central<\/p>\n<p>If his show got more predictable in the past few years \u2013 making the same jokes every night about the same Fox News\/Tea Party bullshit \u2013 that\u2019s because America did too. And it clearly took a toll on him. \u201cWatching these channels all day is incredibly depressing,\u201d he said recently. \u201cI live in a constant state of depression.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Stewart was a strange fit for <i>The Daily Show,<\/i> an already thriving franchise when he took over in 1999. His specialty was a sort of good-natured bro humor. He didn\u2019t do topical material. He looked uncomfortable in a suit and tie. If he\u2019d ever had a political opinion, he kept it to himself. The transition was clumsier than anyone wants to remember. But there was a moment, early on in those first few months, when you could see things change \u2013 in retrospect, this was one of the pivot points of 21st century TV culture. Stewart was doing a bit about the NYPD \u2013 then wracked by a scandal in which at least one cop sexually assaulted and tortured a black man with a toilet plunger \u2013 and its \u201cCPR\u201d motto: \u201cCourtesy, Professionalism, Respect.\u201d Stewart said, \u201cAlthough many officers tragically mistake it for \u2018Cram Plunger in Rectum.\u2019 \u201d<\/p>\n<p>Then he winced \u2013 not a comedian\u2019s wince, not a jokey \u201csorry, folks\u201d wince, just a reflexive flinch that said, \u201cWow, that was not fun at all.\u201d You could see he hated himself for that line, hated the handful of people in the audience who laughed \u2013 and was already telling himself, \u201cYeah, this is exactly what I\u2019m <i>not<\/i> doing from now on.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s the moment when <i>The Daily Show<\/i> became unlike anything else on TV before or since. After 9\/11 scared the media into shutting up and cheerleading for whatever war in whatever country as long as it\u2019s not here, Stewart turned <i>The Daily Show<\/i> into <i>the<\/i> crucial news source in the Bush years. Though he often claimed he was just a comedian making jokes, he clearly relished his newfound role as the ballsy truth-teller puncturing the official lies of the day.<\/p>\n<p>It looked like Stewart was building a lasting legacy. So it\u2019s perhaps strange that he doesn\u2019t have a clear successor. When he signs off, there won\u2019t be other Jon Stewarts out there to continue the kind of political argument he brought to the airwaves. Especially, it seems, on <i>The Daily Show,<\/i> where Stewart\u2019s successor, Trevor Noah, hired in a bizarrely rushed fit of corporate despair, already seems like the wrong man for the job.<\/p>\n<p>Comedy Central honchos clearly saw Noah as a blank slate, without any partisan baggage. But they got caught with their pants down when the world found out about his shockingly lame taste in \u201cedgy\u201d quips, which were offensive mostly for being older than Don Rickles\u2019 mother. (Dude was still doing \u201cBeats by Dreidel\u201d jokes in 2014?) This is a grown man who proudly told a joke about how Thai hookers are cheaper than fast food, so he might order a \u201cQuarter Poundher Deluxe.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Noah made a bad impression worse by saying, \u201cTo reduce my views to a handful of jokes that didn\u2019t land is not a true reflection of my character\u201d \u2013 the exact kind of chickens-hit non-statement Stewart would have ripped apart, if it hadn\u2019t been about his own show.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019ll be an uglier world without Stewart \u2013 but then, that\u2019s the main reason he\u2019s bailing: It\u2019s an uglier world already. So you have to suspect Stewart doesn\u2019t care all that deeply whether <i>The Daily Show<\/i> can carry on without him. It looks like he\u2019s more worried about whether America can carry on at all.<\/p>\n","layout":{},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":0,"link_source":"","competition":[],"flatplan_title":"","notes":"","gutter_credit":"","other":"","image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1467287605.7373","name":"f0036-01","source":"COMEDY CENTRAL","caption":"<p><b>MAD AS HELL<\/b><\/p>\n<p>For more than 15 years, Stewart acted as the nation\u2019s ballsy truth-teller.<\/p>\n","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http:\/\/cdn-assets.ziniopro.com\/var\/site_2923\/storage\/images\/media2\/images\/f0036-017\/38292-1-eng-GB\/f0036-012.jpg?t=default_ipad_portrait&ext\/f0036-012_default_ipad_portrait.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"768","height":"940","legacy_id":"4007","is_default":true},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1467287605.7373","name":"f0036-01","source":"COMEDY CENTRAL","caption":"<p><b>MAD AS HELL<\/b><\/p>\n<p>For more than 15 years, Stewart acted as the nation\u2019s ballsy truth-teller.<\/p>\n","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http:\/\/cdn-assets.ziniopro.com\/var\/site_2923\/storage\/images\/media2\/images\/f0036-017\/38292-1-eng-GB\/f0036-012.jpg?t=default_ipad_landscape&ext\/f0036-012_default_ipad_landscape.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"628","height":"768","legacy_id":"4007","is_default":false}],"url_alias":"http:\/\/site-2923.audiencemedia.com","type":"story","order":"25","folio_number":"36","folio_numbers":"36","pdf_page_index":"36","thumbnail":"http:\/\/cdn-assets.ziniopro.com\/var\/site_2923\/storage\/images\/media2\/images\/f0036-017\/38292-1-eng-GB\/f0036-012.jpg?t=tablet_story_thumbnail&ext\/f0036-012_tablet_story_thumbnail.jpg","color":"FFFFFF","real_id":"4006","main_section_id":"154","ads":[]},{"id":"zinio_28_100340926_1467287607.3324","title":"New York\u2019s Spite Club","sub_title":"","author":[{"id":"0","name":"R.S.","email":"noreply@audiencemedia.com","is_default":false}],"tag":"","strap_line":"SHORT TAKE","intro":"","body":"\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"\/var\/site_2923\/storage\/images\/media2\/images\/f0036-024\/38321-1-eng-GB\/f0036-022.jpg\" width=\"221\" height=\"205\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0036-02\" title=\"f0036-02\" \/>\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p>Eichner and Klausner<\/p>\n <span class=\"credit\">\nALI GOLDSTEIN<\/span><\/figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    <\/div><h3><b>Difficult People<\/b><\/h3><p><b>Hulu<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Before there was warm and fuzzy New York, there was rude and unbearable New York \u2013 the town <i>Difficult People<\/i> proudly calls home.
