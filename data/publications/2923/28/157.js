Pause to admire the white Ferrari 458 Spider in front of it, which, like the SLS, is being washed and waxed on this blazing June day by a team of guys in matching gray polo shirts. Walk up the home\u2019s stone pathway, through the heavy wooden front doors, and try not to stumble over the luggage \u2013 Goyard, Vuitton, Givenchy \u2013 piled in the marble-floored foyer. Wave to the saleswoman from Cartier, who\u2019s made a house call with an array of Love Bracelets and other jewelry in tow. Pause to take in the cascading arrangement of fake flowers in the entryway, and let your gaze move upward along either of the two wrought-iron staircases to the second-floor landing, where an oil painting depicts a short man and a beautiful woman gazing down happily at the Vegas Strip. The short man is Kevin Hart, the hottest stand-up comic in America.<\/p>\n<p>This is his home. Here comes Hart now, wearing furry slippers, distressed jean shorts and, around his neck, two likenesses of Jesus Christ pimpled with diamonds and swinging from gold chains. And here\u2019s the woman from the painting \u2013 Hart\u2019s fiancee, Eniko Parrish \u2013 wearing tiny blue sweatshorts and a tank top with Bob Marley\u2019s face across the front. She\u2019s riding a $1,500 motorized plastic plank called a PhunkeeDuck across the diningroom floor. There are several large portraits of Hart\u2019s heroes on the walls: Eddie Murphy, Dave Chappelle, Jimi Hendrix. \u201cWe good, Giselle?\u201d Hart calls over to the Cartier lady. \u201cIt\u2019ll be just a moment more \u2013 thank you,\u201d she replies, awaiting payment authorization. Hart, 36, and Parrish have a thing for Cartier\u2019s Love Bracelets, marketed as sharable between romantic partners, and Hart has bought enough of them \u2013 straightforward yellow-gold ones, which start at $4,500 apiece; more elaborate ones with diamond settings, which start at $40,000 \u2013 that Cartier gladly dispatches its employees directly to him. Today, Giselle also brought examples of another model, the Juste Un Clou, which resembles a long nail curved into a hoop. One, in diamond-studded white gold, catches Hart\u2019s eye: MSRP $47,000. He adds it to the bill. \u201cI\u2019m still waiting for you to buy a watch from me one day!\u201d Giselle tells Hart.<\/p>\n<p>This is the life Kevin Hart long dreamed of. He dreamed about it when he was a kid growing up in Philadelphia \u2013 his sleeping quarters a bunk bed squeezed into the hallway of the one-bedroom apartment he shared with his single mom and older brother \u2013 and he dreamed about it when he was a fledgling road comic, putting thousands of miles on rental cars and his thengirlfriend\u2019s Grand Cherokee, zigzagging between crappy bookings. Hart has been a comedian since his late teens, but over the past several years he\u2019s drawn ever-larger crowds into ever-larger rooms \u2013 first theaters, then arenas, and at the end of August, an NFL stadium. His current tour, What Now, which cost him \u201csomething like 7, $8 million\u201d to produce, involves an enormous configuration of video screens, travels around on eight tractor-trailers and is on track to become the highest-grossing comedy tour of all time. When he passed through New York, in July, he played three nights at Madison Square Garden and another night at the Barclays Center \u2013 the kind of rooms, as his business partner Jeff Clanagan puts it, \u201cthat Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay Z play together, or Jay and Kanye \u2013 and he\u2019s playing them all by himself.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>A virtuosic, hypercharged performer, Hart doesn\u2019t unfurl punchlines so much as long yarns about crazy relatives (in Hart\u2019s onstage depiction, his dad is a former drug addict with an arsenal of colorful catchphrases); about striving to overcome his own flaws (infidelity); and about one ludicrous indignity after the next. In one beloved bit, an ex-con dressed up as SpongeBob SquarePants terrorizes Hart at a children\u2019s birthday party. \u201cNobody told me that SpongeBob was fresh out!\u201d Hart protests. \u201cThis nigga was fresh out of jail!\u201d In another, he tries to hit on women while driving, only to realize that his kids\u2019 car seats are visible in the back seat, draining away his swagger. He\u2019s able to pivot smoothly from jokes that could fit into a family-friendly sitcom (the time he found himself stuck atop a runaway horse, his legs too short to reach the stirrups) to goofball surrealism (he insists a raccoon that lives near his house has repeatedly threatened to shoot him) to flashes of acid-tongued misanthropy (the bit where he tells an imposing fan at an airport, \u201cKill yourself \u2013 die\u201d).<\/p>\n<p>Har t \u2019s most distinguishing trait as a stand-up, though, is how he combines all this with over-the-top spectacle, carrying on in the bombastic tradition of the Eddie Murphy he first saw in <i>Raw<\/i> \u2013 a vision of leather-clad black bravado that thrilled Hart in his youth. \u201cHe was my generation\u2019s, like, \u2018<i>Holy shit, this guy is unbelievable<\/i>\u2019 \u2013 people fall at his feet, everything he says is golden.\u201d Hart takes stages via hidden elevators and catapults. He wears bespoke jackets, designer high-tops and tons of jewelry. His mic stand is gold. In 2013, Hart gave a theatrical release to his stand-up concert Let Me Explain, which featured enormous Metallica-style columns of fire bursting from the stage \u2013 he sank $2.5 million into the project, cut a deal with theater chains, then reaped $32 million in box-office returns. Describing the upcoming <i>What Now<\/i> film, Hart says, \u201cIt\u2019s not a concert film \u2013 it\u2019s an action movie.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><i>Contributing editor<\/i> JONAH WEINER <i>wrote about Arnold Schwarzenegger in May.<\/i><\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, he\u2019s parlayed his stage success into big TV hosting gigs (<i>Saturday Night Live,<\/i> MTV\u2019s <i>Video Music Awards<\/i>) and blockbuster comedies (<i>Ride Along, The Wedding Ringer<\/i>). He landed in L.A. at 7:30 this morning from Boston, where he\u2019s shooting a new film with Dwayne \u201cThe Rock\u201d Johnson. He\u2019ll fly back to the set on a private jet tonight, after performing What Now for a sold-out crowd at the Staples Center. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t believe how many people have hit me up for tickets today,\u201d he says. His ex-wife and the mother of his kids, Torrei Hart, is coming. Jeffrey Katzenberg will be backstage to say hello. Floyd Mayweather says he\u2019s coming too.<\/p>\n<p>Hart works his phone, communicating with his team, with the guys washing his car, with Parrish in the other room. In the few hours he has in L.A., he\u2019s cramming in all sorts of housekeeping. \u201cMultitasking!\u201d he says. This morning, he met with contractors building him a new mansion up the 101, near his buddy Drake and some of the Kardashians. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna keep this house, maybe use it as a guest house for family,\u201d Hart says as he opens a door onto the in-home theater. He\u2019s a conscientious host: Last Christmas, Parrish bought him a massage chair from Brookstone, and he insists that I nestle into it, then kindly dials me up a 15-minute rubdown. \u201cYou like that?\u201d He checks on his kids, of whom he shares custody: On a kitchen stool, his 10-year-old daughter, Heaven, is getting her hair braided. His seven-year-old son, Hendrix, bounces around on a couch, wielding a plastic blunderbuss: \u201cIt\u2019s a fart gun,\u201d Hendrix says, aiming a blast my way. Hart scoops up Hendrix tenderly and, after dipping him upside down, plants him, shrieking with laughter, on his shoulders. When Heaven\u2019s hair is done, Hart pulls three hundred-dollar bills from his shorts and hands them to her to give to the hairdresser. \u201cTell her thank you and that your hair looks beautiful,\u201d he tells Heaven. \u201cAnd say it nicely, please.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"pullQuote\">\u201cI DON\u2019T GIVE A SHIT ABOUT CRITICAL CONSENSUS! THEY POLL PEOPLE AFTER MY MOVIES, AND I GET A\u2019S. WHEN I GET AN F, I\u2019LL TAKE CRITICISM.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The subtext being that it\u2019s important, when whirlwinds of success threaten to sweep you away, to remain grounded. This is the message that Hart hammered home to me when I first met him, three years ago, at a Detroit casino. In town to play a Let Me Explain show for about half a million dollars, Hart blew $10,000 in 45 minutes at a blackjack table, then retired to his penthouse suite to iron the custom-made leather T-shirt he\u2019d wear onstage that night \u2013 if he delegated such chores to others, he explained, he risked losing touch.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s one of several contradictions Hart juggles. He says success hasn\u2019t changed him, and yet he also styles himself a \u201ccomedic rock star.\u201d He tries to keep his mostly autobiographical jokes true to his increasingly surreal life without alienating fans. \u201cYou don\u2019t ever want to look down on your audience,\u201d he says. Hart counts among his mentors superstars like Murphy and Chris Rock, and comics\u2019 comics like Patrice O\u2019Neal and Dave Attell, but ultimately he is comparable to no one in his field. To truly get his measure, you need to think about artist-businessmen like Jay Z or Tyler Perry. Hart has had a production company for five years; he leads a crew of comedians, nicknamed the Plastic Cup Boyz, who open for him at arenas and whose careers he hopes to launch to new heights. On the horizon, he is developing a video-sharing comedy site that he intends to rival Funny or Die, and has plans to penetrate the lucrative fitness sector. Kevin Hart, in other words, wants to become the world\u2019s most hilarious mogul. \u201cAt this point,\u201d he says, \u201cI\u2019m competing against Kevin Hart.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"\/var\/site_2923\/storage\/images\/media2\/images\/f0049-016\/38591-1-eng-GB\/f0049-012.jpg\" width=\"507\" height=\"502\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0049-01\" title=\"f0049-01\" \/>\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>GOLDEN CHILD<\/b><\/p>\n<p>(1) Hart posts snippets from his intense workouts on social media.<\/p>\n <span class=\"credit\">\nARNOLD TURNER\/INVISION\/AP IMAGES; COURTESY OF KEVIN HART, 4<\/span><\/figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    <\/div>\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"\/var\/site_2923\/storage\/images\/media2\/images\/f0049-026\/38584-1-eng-GB\/f0049-022.jpg\" width=\"234\" height=\"362\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0049-02\" title=\"f0049-02\" \/>\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p>(2) In Vegas with fiancee Eniko Parrish last year.<\/p>\n<\/figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    <\/div>\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"\/var\/site_2923\/storage\/images\/media2\/images\/f0049-034\/38577-1-eng-GB\/f0049-032.jpg\" width=\"383\" height=\"186\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0049-03\" title=\"f0049-03\" \/>\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p>(3) With brother Robert Hart and father Henry Witherspoon.<\/p>\n<\/figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    <\/div>\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"\/var\/site_2923\/storage\/images\/media2\/images\/f0049-043\/38570-1-eng-GB\/f0049-042.jpg\" width=\"407\" height=\"410\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0049-04\" title=\"f0049-04\" \/>\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p>(4) In 2013.

He stacks a Juste Un Clou and some Love Bracelets on his wrist. \u201cYou\u2019re about to O.D.!\u201d Parrish says, watching the baubles accumulate. Heaven and Hendrix wheel <i>Minions<\/i>-themed luggage to Hart\u2019<\/p>\n<p>detricked-out chauffeured Mercedes Sprinter van, idling out front, because they\u2019re f lying with their dad to Massachusetts after the show. We roll off . Kevin Hart has his own logo \u2013 K \u2665 \u2013 embroidered into the Sprinter\u2019s carpeting. Hendrix plays games on his iPhone 6, but Heaven is feeling more talkative. \u201cHow can you breathe inside a car if there are no trees in a car?\u201d she asks, having recently learned, it seems, that trees release oxygen into the atmosphere. Hart, typing tweets about tonight\u2019s show, doesn\u2019t answer, but he is an alert, doting dad. At one point, while I\u2019m recounting one of his bits out loud, I use the word \u201cfucking\u201d \u2013 Heaven cries, \u201cDollar!\u201d and Hart actually makes me put a buck in a swear jar.<\/p>\n<p>Hart\u2019s Sprinter merges onto the southbound 101. He\u2019s accustomed at this point to sitting in traffic jams when driving to his shows: gridlock created by his own fans. \u201cWe get police escorts sometimes,\u201d he says, but it\u2019s early enough that the highway isn\u2019t too clogged, and so we pull into a loading dock at the Staples Center with several hours to spare before showtime. In Hart\u2019s dressing room, several guys from his entourage sit at a large table. One of them is Hart\u2019s longtime co-writer Harry Ratchford, who explains that they\u2019re playing Guts, \u201cwhich is kind of like Poker, but the money piles up faster.\u201d The biggest single hand they\u2019ve ever played was \u201cI think, $32,000.\u201d How\u2019s Hart at it? \u201cLike a lot of things with Kevin, he started horrible. He\u2019d lose $70,000 in a night. But he kept at it, kept getting better, and now you can\u2019t beat him.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>A few feet away is a tall white guy with shaggy hair. This is Dave Becky, Hart\u2019s manager. Becky\u2019s client list includes numerous comedy greats \u2013 Amy Poehler, Louis C.K., Aziz Ansari \u2013 but he says Hart is unique in the way he combines the respect of his peers with his outsize tendencies. \u201cOn paper, if you told me there\u2019s a guy selling crazy tickets with fire in his act, not knowing the comedian, I\u2019d say that\u2019s probably a guy who at his core is not great,\u201d Becky says. \u201cBut Kevin sells out arenas, has this crazy production \u2013 and Chris Rock, who would usually absolutely hate that, calls him fucking amazing.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Hart came up through Philadelphia clubs like the Laff House, eventually making a name for himself on the New York club circuit. At first he was far stronger as a performer than he was as a writer of jokes. He recalls being invited by a group com-of more-established comics, like Bill Burr and O\u2019Neal, who later befriended him, to a table at the Comedy Cellar, where they sat him down and trashed his hackier aspects. \u201cI was doing a joke about a cross-eyed midget at the time,\u201d Hart says. \u201cThey were like, \u2018Really? Are you really teaching us something new about cross-eyed midgets?\u2019 \u201d This was a rite of passage, he explains, in which they encouraged him to find laughs in harder-to-reach places: \u201cThey were telling me, \u2018You\u2019re good enough for us to shit all over you.\u2019 \u201d<\/p>\n<p>Stand-up is Hart\u2019s first love, and he says he\u2019ll never stop telling jokes onstage, no matter how many movies he does. But he also wants to be sure that, in writing about him, I capture his business ambitions and acumen. For instance, Hart\u2019s social-media presence has grown so enormous \u2013 he has more than 56 million followers across the major platforms \u2013 that his company Hartbeat Digital charges studios extra for his tweets or Instagrams about movies he\u2019s in. It was for this reason that a Sony executive, discussing Hart in e-mails exposed during that company\u2019s infamous hack, called him \u201ca whore.\u201d Hart responded with an impassioned Instagram post about knowing, and protecting, his self-worth, and he said later that he harbored no ill will toward the exec. Talking about it now, Hart says, \u201cStudios will do ad buys to promote films \u2013 with my numbers on social media, why wouldn\u2019t they pay me, too?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>After grabbing a quick bite from the steam trays in his dressing room, Hart walks to a small office across the hall, where he\u2019s arranged a meeting with two marketing reps from a major athletics-apparel company. Hart\u2019s devotees have come to know him as a fitness freak: He routinely posts images online of his workouts and uses hashtags like #HealthIsWealth and #FitFamily. He invited the reps here in hopes of obtaining an endorsement deal \u2013 he wants to partner with them at cobranded fitness events and appear in their ads. He tells them it would be counter-intuitively genius for the company to give him, a non-athlete, the sort of deal usually reserved for pros like LeBron James and David Beckham. (Hart pauses to note that he will be appearing alongside Beckham in an H&amp;M ad campaign.) In two cities so far during the What Now tour, he goes on, he\u2019s arranged spontaneous 5K runs \u2013 inviting his fan base out for early-morning jogs.<\/p>\n<p>He\u2019s going to keep doing these 5Ks, with a blowout installment planned for his upcoming stop in Philadelphia, where he\u2019s playing the 69,000-seat Lincoln Financial Field: \u201cI\u2019m gonna run up the <i>Rocky<\/i> steps for the finish.\u201d So far, he says, \u201cPeople think these runs are just for fun.\u201d But Hart has a secret plan. \u201cMy number-one priority is: People are dying. They need to get off the couch. Fitness is real. Aunt A and Uncle C are dying. We gotta get people to understand that.\u201d Number two? \u201cKevin Hart is a walking marketing tool,\u201d he says. \u201cSay you guys have a new product coming, say it wicks the moisture, whatever, I don\u2019t know what the fuck it does \u2013 whatever the product is, I can wear it and market it at the runs in a way that looks authentic. It won\u2019t look like a commercial. Because I\u2019m actually your consumer, the non-athlete who works out hard, and I have a direct connection to my fan base.\u201d There\u2019s a charity angle to boot: \u201cI\u2019m donating money from my Philly show to renovate parks in the inner city, put them in my mother\u2019s name, out of my pocket. I\u2019m doing playgrounds because I want something visual that I can be associated with.\u201d The reps nod slowly, absorbing all this. Before they can respond, Hart hits them with the kicker: \u201cWith or without a brand, I\u2019m doing it.\u201d He lets it slip that talks with other companies are imminent. \u201cIt\u2019s gonna happen. But how much stronger would it be with your brand?\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"pullQuote\">\u201cI\u2019 VE PERFORMED AT ATLANTIC CITY STRIP CLUBS, FAMILY DINNERS, FUNCTIONS \u2013 ALL THE SHOTS TO MY PRIDE HAVE BEEN TAKEN.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>And with that, the reps ask me to leave so they can talk more freely. Later, avoiding specifics, Hart says, \u201cI crushed it \u2013 they were speechless.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><b>M<\/b>ANY COMEDIANS aren\u2019t overly interested in being funny when they\u2019re not performing, but Hart takes it to another level. In business meetings and interviews, he\u2019s unselfconsciously earnest when he\u2019s talking about himself \u2013 a sharp difference between his sly, self-deprecating onstage persona. In one raucous moment during What Now, Hart describes experimenting with sex toys meant to simulate different orifices, after Parrish gives him a \u201cpocket pussy\u201d to encourage his fidelity when they\u2019re apart. It\u2019s a wonderfully filthy bit about a once-philandering man reckoning, messily, with new love and monogamy. Ask Hart in person about the themes he\u2019s exploring, however, and he\u2019ll say something bland about \u201chow I\u2019ve grown as a man.\u201d In such moments, he seems less like a comedian and more like an athlete offering post-game bromides. Maybe in part it\u2019s because, as a kid, he was both class clown and jock. During high school, Hart competed on the swim team and played basketball. A small-built kid, he also learned to rely on his wits, making himself popular by cracking up classmates.<\/p>\n<p>Hart\u2019s father, Henry Witherspoon, separated from Kevin\u2019s mother when he was around four. Hart says that when he was about 12, he was out with his dad when Witherspoon pointed out a young man nearby and told Hart, \u201cThat\u2019s your brother Omar.\u201d Kevin, who\u2019d grown up with his older brother Robert, was confused. It turned out that Witherspoon had fathered a boy with another woman, and this was the way Kevin found out.<\/p>\n<p>In Hart\u2019s act, he tends to describe his father as a more or less lovably cartoonish character, referring only obliquely to darker moments, like the family gathering where Witherspoon tried to steal a $20 bill given to Kevin by a relative, or those times, Hart says, when Witherspoon has alluded to \u201csucking dick\u201d for money during the depths of his addiction. I ask Hart how his father, who remains in his life, responds to such bits. \u201cHe laughs!\u201d Hart says, adding, \u201cHe can\u2019t say shit, because I take care of him.\u201d Hart\u2019s got his own hedonistic streak that he\u2019s learned to keep in check the hard way: In 2013, he pleaded no contest to one count of DUI and received a sentence of three years of probation and three months of alcohol-education classes. But overall he seems to wear the burdens of his childhood lightly. Robert Hart, who is eight years older than Kevin, and with whom he remains close, says this is because he was insulated from Witherspoon\u2019s worst behavior: \u201cMy dad was crazy. Kevin was too young to know that the shit was as dysfunctional as it was.\u201d In Witherspoon\u2019s absence, Robert \u2013 a former barbershop owner who is now a professional pool player \u2013 says he became something of a father figure to Kevin. \u201cIf he had a bad report card or cussed, he had to worry about me,\u201d Robert says. He adds, laughingly, that Kevin was always an extrovert, \u201cbut he\u2019s my younger brother, so he wasn\u2019t funny to me, he was stupid! He was being an asshole! It was, \u2018Act like you got some damn sense!\u2019 \u201d<\/p>\n<p>Hart wasn\u2019t a great student, and after high school, \u201cI went to community college for, like, a week and a half, but then I fell in love with the whole comedy thing, and I told my mom, \u2018This is what I\u2019m going to do, I really have a passion for this,\u2019 \u201d he recalls. He got interested in stand-up after a co-worker at a Philadelphia sneaker store encouraged him to drop in on an open-mic night. Hart\u2019s mother, Nancy, a computer analyst at the University of Pennsylvania, agreed to pay his $550 monthly rent as he chased the dream: \u201cShe said, \u2018I\u2019ll help you out for a year.\u2019 \u201d This support came with only one string attached: \u201cShe was putting the rent checks in my Bible, and there was a point where I was back on my rent for, like, two months and I was like, \u2018Mom, I need the checks.\u2019 And she was like, \u2018Have you been reading your Bible?\u2019 I would just keep lying: \u2018Yes, Mom, it\u2019s not about that right now.\u2019 She said, \u2018When you read your Bible, I\u2019ll know.\u2019 \u201d<\/p>\n<p>Hart\u2019s talents impressed established comedians like Keith Robinson and Attell, who gave Hart crucial early support, and for a moment it seemed he might become a star almost overnight \u2013 in relatively short order, he got a series picked up at ABC and landed a starring role in <i>Soul Plane.<\/i> \u201cHe was what I call Hollywood Hot,\u201d says Becky. But the ABC series was quickly canceled, and <i>Soul Plane<\/i> was a flop. In 2001, Hart auditioned for <i>Saturday Night Live,<\/i> but he was rejected. Becky recalls, \u201cWe were sure he was gonna get it, but it came down to Kevin and Dean Edwards\u201d \u2013 a comedian who left <i>SNL<\/i> two years later \u2013 \u201cand the other guy got it. The first thing Kevin did was to call him and say congratulations. He\u2019s had ups and downs, but he\u2019s never complained \u2013 he\u2019s just kept working.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"\/var\/site_2923\/storage\/images\/media2\/images\/f0051-013\/38556-1-eng-GB\/f0051-012.jpg\" width=\"470\" height=\"513\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0051-01\" title=\"f0051-01\" \/>\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p>Hart at the Laff House in Philly, 1999: \u201cYou have to learn to give people what they want.\u201d<\/p>\n <span class=\"credit\">\nMICHAEL BRANSCOM\/\u201cPHILADELPHIA WEEKLY\u201d<\/span><\/figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    <\/div><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been to some of the damnedest places for comedy,\u201d Hart says. \u201cI performed in a place in Atlantic City called Sweet Cheeks. It was a male strip night, and some nights a female strip night, and in the middle they would stop the stripper show and have intermission, where as comedians it was our job to go up and make the people laugh. I performed at family dinners, family functions, like where you get there and you\u2019re the entertainment for a household. You name it: All shots to my pride have been taken.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>With Hollywood glory forestalled, Hart redoubled his focus on stand-up. Between a barrage of small roles in projects from <i>The 40-Year-Old Virgin<\/i> to <i>Scary Movie 4,<\/i> he added another element to his act, offsetting his flights of silliness and inspired physical comedy with an autobiographical strain. By 2011 \u2019s 90-city Laugh at My Pain tour, he\u2019d found ways to eke out laughs from his father\u2019s troubles, from his crumbling marriage with Torrei, and, perhaps darkest of all, from his mother\u2019s death, in 2007, from ovarian cancer. The subject of her illness, which she kept secret from him for a while, for fear of distracting him from his career, is one that can reliably choke him up. \u201cShe was a strong woman, dude,\u201d he says. \u201cDidn\u2019t take no shit.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The success of Laugh at My Pain got Hollywood\u2019s attention. After the romantic comedy <i>Think Like a Man,<\/i> anchored by Hart, enjoyed a $33 million opening weekend, Becky says, \u201cThe offers started pouring in.\u201d Hart is routinely the best thing about the movies he\u2019s in, but he says he isn\u2019t bothered that he has yet to star in a particularly well-reviewed film. \u201cI don\u2019t give three shits about critical consensus!\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t even read reviews. The people that count are the people who go out and buy the tickets. They poll people afterward, and I get A\u2019s. The worst score I ever got was a B, B-minus. When I get an F, that\u2019s when I\u2019ll take criticism.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Hart, an avowed crowd-pleaser, isn\u2019t aiming to push boundaries or tackle taboos. Describing his sensibility in interviews, he\u2019s said things like \u201cI\u2019m not a political guy\u201d and \u201cWhat you have to learn to do is to give people what they want \u2013 people love a broad comedy.\u201d There is one prominent exception to this. In 2010\u2019 s <i>Seriously Funny,<\/i> he tells the audience, \u201cOne of my biggest fears is my son growing up and being gay. That\u2019s a fear. Keep in mind, I\u2019m not homophobic. . . . Be happy. Do what you want to do. But me, as a heterosexual male, if I can prevent my son from being gay, I will.\u201d This leads into vignettes in which Hart reacts to imagined signs of Hendrix\u2019s blossoming homosexuality with interjections of \u201cStop, that\u2019s gay!\u201d Discussing this bit today, Hart says, \u201cIt\u2019s about my fear. I\u2019m thinking about what I did as a dad, did I do something wrong, and if I did, what was it? Not that I\u2019m not gonna love my son or think about him any differently. The funny thing within that joke is it\u2019s me getting mad at my son because of my own insecurities \u2013 I panicked. It has nothing to do with him, it\u2019s about me. That\u2019s the difference between bringing a joke across that\u2019s well thought-out and saying something just to ruffle feathers.\u201d Even so, he adds, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t tell that joke today, because when I said it, the times weren\u2019t as sensitive as they are now. I think we love to make big deals out of things that aren\u2019t necessarily big deals, because we can. These things become public spectacles. So why set yourself up for failure?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Race as an overt topic figures very little into Hart\u2019s comedy. His core audience is black, but \u201cI approach it on a universal level,\u201d he says, and the proof of his success on this score is the racially diverse crowd that now comes out to see him. \u201cIf you associate yourself with one group of people, you alienate another 12, you know? So the thing for me is, how can I make everybody laugh at this one thought? The thought may be provoked by something that happened on the stoop or at the barbershop, but now how do I make it broad enough for everyone to understand it and see it?\u201d I ask if he has ever felt compelled to address race more pointedly in his act, particularly in the past year, when racism, and racist violence, have dominated the national conversation. He says that, offstage, these issues infuriate him: \u201cA guy in the hood with two nickel bags of weed gets five years in jail, because they say they want to make an example of him, but I haven\u2019t seen one judge make an example out of one of these police officers that killed one of these young black men.\u201d But he keeps it offstage: \u201cWhen I see videos of children being shot dead by police, I don\u2019t talk about it because it\u2019s something that scares me. Because I have kids. At that point, it\u2019s not a joking matter. There is no joking there. I would not touch it.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Part of the reason is that Hart wants to be seen as \u201ca motivational figure. I won\u2019t acknowledge what I won\u2019t let beat me. Have I experienced racism? Of course. But will I make you feel superior by saying I\u2019ve felt trumped at times? No. I\u2019ll beat you by succeeding. I want to show my generation that a man of color, despite the roadblocks, can still make it. There\u2019s moments when I took to social media and said things, but it\u2019s always been on the positive side. I gave a message to Baltimore: At the end of the day, we\u2019re only hurting ourselves by destroying what we have. We have to go back and live there. We\u2019re torching, firebombing, looting our stuff. We need that CVS! Be smarter than this!\u201d Hart doesn\u2019t see a time coming when he explores racism in his act, like his idols Rock and Chappelle do. Hart characterizes his appeal differently. \u201cIt\u2019s not my style of comedy,\u201d he says. \u201cIt angers me, but not onstage. Onstage, my job is to take away whatever problems are in the world, for that brief moment of time.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><b>A<\/b>FTER THE STAPLES SHOW, HART makes a quick exit and heads in the Sprinter to a tiny airfield in Van Nuys, where a small chartered jet awaits. No identification is needed to board. No seat belts are fastened. A pretty woman dressed all in black takes drink and food orders. Hart retires to the back, covers up with a blanket and falls asleep. When the plane lands the next morning at an airstrip in Bedford, Massachusetts, it\u2019s drizzling outside. Three luxury SUVs await on the tarmac, feet from the plane. In the strip\u2019s office, a worker in a bright-orange reflective vest says that when Dwayne Johnson flew in the other day, \u201call the women who work here were trying to get a look at him,\u201d but it\u2019s early now, and no one\u2019s around to gawk at Hart. Parrish and the kids take one SUV to a house they\u2019ve rented in the suburb of Winchester. Hart, operating on no more than four hours of sleep, takes another SUV to the set.<\/p>\n<p>The film Hart\u2019s shooting with Johnson is an action comedy called <i>Central Intelligence.<\/i> The first shot of the day requires the co-stars to be hoisted up on harnesses in front of a 40-by-45-foot blue backdrop. In the movie, it will look as though they\u2019ve just jumped from a building. As Hart and the Rock regard the looming crane that will be taking them airborne, they rib each other.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna be shitting on you all day!\u201d Hart tells him.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cShut your mouth!\u201d says the Rock. He turns to me: \u201cWatch Kevin piss his pants up there.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Hart\u2019s job, over dozens of ensuing takes, is essentially to shout, \u201cFuck-fuck-fuck-fuck-fuck-fuck!\u201d or simply shriek unintelligibly while feigning free fall. It is tedious, repetitive work, but he does it with full-throated conviction each time.<\/p>\n<p>Between setups, Hart has returned to solid ground, at which point the director, Rawson Marshall Thurber, walks over to the tent where Hart\u2019s standing. Hart is wearing a sweater under the hot midday sun, bouncing in place, awaiting the next take. I say it looks like he\u2019s having a great time up on the wire. \u201cI\u2019m not!\u201d he replies. Thurber grins, slaps Hart affectionately on the shoulder and says that he\u2019s a master at hiding his fatigue behind a facade of manic enthusiasm. \u201cKevin is like my dad when you put on a movie,\u201d Thurber says. \u201cIf he stops moving, he\u2019ll fall asleep.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Hart nods his head vigorously, pretends to pass out, then snaps his eyes open wide and laughs. \u201cCan\u2019t stop!\u201d he cries.<\/p>\n<p>He shifts his weight from foot to foot, bouncing in place. \u201cIf you sit me still, we\u2019re in trouble!\u201d<\/p>\n","layout":{},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":0,"link_source":"","competition":[],"flatplan_title":"","notes":"","gutter_credit":"","other":"","image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1467287638.1164","name":"f0047-01","source":"FUR COAT BY KAUFMAN FURS, BOOTS BY COSTUME NATIONAL, SUNGLASSES BY MYKITA, RINGS BY RAFAELLO & CO.

Mohammed Issa, a rotund and mustachioed border-police officer, gestures to a massive U.S. Air Force transport jet \u2013 a gray C-17 Globemaster \u2013 sitting a short distance away. \u201cSince the start of the war in Yemen, it\u2019s been crazy here,\u201d he says. \u201cMilitary flights, humanitarian aid \u2013 sometimes there\u2019s no space to park on the tarmac.\u201d \u00b6 Djibouti is a tiny state of citrus-colored shacks and goat-lined boulevards tucked into a barren, volcanic stretch of the Horn of Africa. It sits astride the narrow straits that lead to the Red Sea and the Suez Canal, and is home to the U.S.\u2019s only permanent military base in Africa, Camp Lemonnier, linchpin of one of the Obama administration\u2019s most secretive and controversial programs: the drone-based campaign of surveillance and assassination against Al Qaeda and its allies in Somalia and Yemen. \u00b6 Yemen, an impoverished, restive nation of 27 million on the southern end of the Arabian Peninsula has, in particular, been the focus of extensive counterterrorism efforts since the deadly attack on the <i>USS Cole<\/i> in 2000. Its branch of Al Qaeda has hatched some of the most dangerous plots against the United States, including the so-called Underwear Bomber, who tried to take down a commercial jet over Detroit with explosives in his boxer shorts. The Obama administration assassinated its first U.S. citizen, the fiery propagandist Anwar al-Awlaki, in Yemen\u2019s arid badlands. American special-operations forces have spent years training Yemeni counterterrorism units. In his speech unveiling his plan to combat ISIS last September, Obama held up Yemen as an example of where the U.S. had \u201csuccessfully pursued\u201d his counterterrorism strategy.<\/p>\n<p>That strategy has now completely unraveled, as Yemen has become the latest country in the Middle East to descend into a fullfledged civil war. In March, after Houthi rebels seized control of the government, a coalition of Arab states led by Saudi Arabia, which accuses the Houthis of being supported by its archrival Iran, launched a U.S.-supported campaign of airstrikes and imposed a land, air and sea blockade of the country \u2013 which it says is necessary to keep out Iranian weapons.<\/p>\n<p>Four months of bitter fighting later, the Houthis control even more territory. And the conflict has pushed this already impoverished country to the brink of a massive humanitarian catastrophe, with the aid community warning of an impending famine if the blockade is not lifted. More than 3,700 Yemenis have died, nearly half of them civilians, and more than 1.25 million have been displaced from their homes.<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Al Qaeda has taken advantage of the chaos to seize wide swaths of eastern Yemen, including the port city of Mukalla, and has called for new attacks against the U.S. ISIS has gained a foothold and launched car-bomb attacks in the capital. Forced to evacuate its embassy and 125 special-operations advisers, the U.S. found its counterterrorism strategy in shambles, with many of the weapons and equipment it supplied to Yemen reported to be in the hands of militias.<\/p>\n<p>MATTHIEU AIKINS <i>is the Schell Fellow at the Nation Institute.

I arrive in Djibouti in the hopes of finding a refugee or cargo boat that could take me there, but the news is bad. The Djiboutian government, I\u2019m told, at the behest of the Saudi coalition, has recently started vetting even small commercial vessels. If my photographer and I want to get in by sea, we will have to find a smuggler willing to run the naval blockade in a speedboat.<\/p>\n<p>The boat we find is 23 feet long and made of fiber-glass, with a low, daggershaped hull, and looks a little flimsy for a 130-mile crossing of the Bab al Mandab strait. As we leave the port, an American military speedboat loops by to take a look at us, and my photographer and I slouch below the low gunwales. Once we are out to sea, our captain, whom I\u2019ll call Yousuf, relaxes. Like many of the fishermen who plied the coastal waters of the Horn of Africa, he is used to taking unusual cargo. In past years, he has taken Ethiopian mi-grants, crammed in 30 or more at a time, on this route and deposited them clandestinely on the Yemeni shore, to continue their harrowing journey in search of work in the wealthy petro-monarchies of the Persian Gulf. \u201cThey don\u2019t know enough to be afraid,\u201d he says.<\/p>\n<p>Over the horizon to our starboard is the port of Aden, which had once been the capital of an independent South Yemen, before the nation was reunited in 1990 under Ali Abdullah Saleh. Saleh had been a key U.S. ally and had supported the drone program in return for aid, but he was toppled in 2011 by protests during the Arab Spring, by demonstrators who demanded the same things as those in Cairo and Damascus: an end to economic stagnation and corruption, and the unaccountable, repressive institutions that sustained the region\u2019s strongmen.<\/p>\n<p>For a moment, Yemen seemed like an Arab Spring success story. Saleh\u2019s relatively peaceful departure was brokered by the U.N., Saudi Arabia and the Gulf Cooperation Council. In the aftermath of the agreement, Saleh\u2019s vice president, Abdu Rabbu Mansur Hadi, ran unopposed for president and won. But the hopes of 2011 gradually faded as the country\u2019s political elites dallied and squabbled in the capital, Sana\u2019a. Under Hadi\u2019s ineffectual reign, corruption and the economy worsened.<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the Houthis, a band of militia fighters based in the northern province of Saada, grew more and more powerful. Over the past few years, as Yemen\u2019s political order collapsed from infighting, the Houthis expanded their territory through a combination of political bargains and military victories, entering Sana\u2019a last September and finally putting Hadi under house arrest in January. The next month, he escaped to Aden, where, backed by Saudi funding and weapons, he declared a new temporary capital. The Houthis marched into the south, Hadi fled to Riyadh, and the Saudi-led bombing campaign and blockade began.<\/p>\n<p>As night falls, the boat\u2019s passage kicks up a glowing trail of phosphorescent algae in the dark and muggy sea. Yousuf can still navigate using the lights of the shoreline, but it doesn\u2019t seem wise to try to enter the rebel-held port at night in the middle of a civil war. We decide to anchor in the lee of a small island, and we bob gently for a few hours, watching a distant lighted procession of tankers and container ships steaming through the channel toward the Suez Canal.<\/p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"\/var\/site_2923\/storage\/images\/media2\/images\/f0055-014\/38676-1-eng-GB\/f0055-012.jpg\" width=\"1013\" height=\"664\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0055-01\" title=\"f0055-01\" \/>\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n <span class=\"credit\">\nMAP BY JOHN GRIMWADE<\/span><\/figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    <\/div><h3><b>THE CRISIS IN YEMEN<\/b><\/h3><p>When civil war erupted in Yemen, Saudi Arabia, fearing the rise of rebels sympathetic to its rival Iran, intervened; now, the conflict threatens to further destabilize the war-torn region.<\/p>\n<p>Near dawn, we weigh anchor and set off again through choppy seas. The rising sun is obscured by a scrim of haze hanging over the highlands to the east as we approach the small port city of Mokha. The driver of a passing skiff smuggling gasoline has warned us there were airstrikes the night before, but we find a scene of calm activity at the pier. Teenage-looking Houthi fighters with battered Kalashnikovs take us to a weary but friendly civil servant; with assent, he stamps our passports and welcomes us to Yemen.<\/p>\n<p>Our fixer has come down from Sana\u2019a to pick us up, and we begin the long journey north to the capital in the mountains. There is a fuel shortage because of the blockade, and the highways are empty of traffic. In the port of Hodeidah, the breakdown in public services is apparent as we drive through puddles of raw sewage and around mounds of trash piled high in the roundabouts. There has been little or no electricity for months, and in the sweltering June nights, people have taken to sleeping in the streets, where they risk catching dengue fever from the mosquitoes \u2013 a major outbreak of the virus has hit coastal Yemen, with more than 8,000 cases reported in Aden alone.<\/p>\n<p>It is night by the time we reach Sana\u2019a. The capital lies in a bowl of mountains at more than 7,000 feet, and is one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities on Earth. In the age of camel caravans, it was a trading entrep\u00f4t between West and East, and was famous for the rich incenses and perfumes coveted in the temples of ancient Rome. Yemen\u2019s diaspora of merchants has spread around Africa and Asia, including the construction magnate Mohammed bin Laden, whose son Osama would be raised in his adopted homeland of Saudi Arabia.<\/p>\n<p>In happier times, Yemen\u2019s warm, traditional society has been a magnet for adventure-minded tourists, and its fanciful old cities, whose multistory mud houses have been dubbed the \u201cworld\u2019s first skyscrapers,\u201d are UNESCO-listed World Heritage Sites. Now, however, blockaded and bombarded, the capital was in utter darkness, broken only by our headlights and the lamps wielded by Houthi fighters at checkpoints.<\/p>\n<p><b>S<\/b>AUDI ARABIA AND YEMEN might be likened to the U.S. and Mexico. Deep economic and cultural ties between the two countries have been strained by smuggling and illegal immigration, even as Saudi Arabia is home to a substantial population of Yemeni workers. And like the U.S. in Latin America, Saudi Arabia has always envisioned a right to intervene in the internal affairs of its poorer southern neighbor, based on its own national security. Though there is little evidence of direct Iranian military support for the Houthis, Saudi Arabia\u2019s Sunni monarchy has been increasingly concerned with a perceived Shiite threat from Iran, especially in the wake of its successful nuclear negotiations with the U.S.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis war overall has less to do with Yemen and more to do with Saudi Arabia\u2019s obsession with Iran\u2019s rise in the region,\u201d says Farea al-Muslimi, a Yemeni political analyst and a visiting scholar at the Carnegie Middle East Center. \u201cIt has to do with a regional message, especially from the Saudis to the U.S.: We don\u2019t need you, we can take the lead in our own war.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>On March 25th, the Saudis launched Operation Decisive Storm. Its name wasn\u2019t the only thing that seemed torn from a Bush-era playbook. They had assembled a coalition of the willing, which included the wealthy Gulf states of the United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Bahrain \u2013 who, like the Saudis, were flush with U.S. and Western military equipment \u2013 as well as Egypt and unlikelier add-ons like Sudan and Morocco. The coalition contributed a handful of aircraft, but the majority was from the Saudi air force.<\/p>\n<p>The Saudis\u2019 goal had been to force the Houthis to withdraw from Sana\u2019a and return Hadi to power, but it was unclear how air power alone would achieve that, as the rebels continued their advance across the country, pushing into oil-rich Marib Province and capturing Al Anad air base, where U.S. special forces had been stationed. On April 21st, the Saudi military declared that Decisive Storm\u2019s mission had been accomplished, claiming that the threat from ballistic missiles and heavy weapons captured by the Houthis had been neutralized. (On June 6th, the Houthis fired their first Scud missile at Saudi Arabia.) Next, the Saudis launched Operation Renewal of Hope, whose objectives included \u201cprotecting civilians.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the bombing and fighting across Yemen escalated. On an almost daily basis, the rumble of jets filled the air above Sana\u2019a. Houthi anti-aircraft gunners would start firing \u2013 the jets flew so high that it was unclear what they were hoping to accomplish, and their shells would often land and cause casualties in the city \u2013 followed by the heavy explosions of airstrikes. The bombing did succeed in destroying much of Yemen\u2019s military and government infrastructure that the Houthis had captured. The Yemeni air force was wiped out, and the results of the U.S.\u2019s train-and-equip program \u2013 worth $500 million since 2007 \u2013 vanished as security forces abandoned their posts or joined warring militias. On May 27th, the Saudis flattened the Special Security Force base in Sana\u2019a, which had been home to the U.S.-funded and -trained Counterterrorism Unit.<\/p>\n<p>By the time we arrive, however, the Saudis have been targeting individual houses in and around the densely packed capital, which, no matter how exact American precision-guided technology might be, leads inevitably to civilian death. In one early-morning strike against the house of one of President Saleh\u2019s relatives that I visited on June 13th, five members of a single family were killed when one of the bombs overshot its target by 20 feet and landed in front of their home.<\/p>\n<p>As a result of the conflict, Yemen was splitting into north and south. Even as the Houthis consolidated their grip on Sana\u2019a, by mid- July Saudi-backed Yemeni militiamen and armored vehicles from the Emirates had helped pro-Hadi forces establish a foothold in Aden. On July 16th, a delegation of exiled ministers flew back to the shattered southern city to prepare to establish a rival capital.<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, as civilian casualties mount and Al Qaeda thrives on the chaos, the Obama administration is facing a dilemma of its own. American officials have warned that the U.S. counterterrorism strategy has suffered a setback in Yemen. \u201cAl Qaeda is controlling an important port city, and their safe haven is unmolested by coalition airstrikes,\u201d says Alley of the Crisis Group. \u201cIt\u2019s quite clear that in many Western governments, there\u2019s a growing discomfort with the war.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>For now, the American government continues to support the campaign by providing aerial refueling, intelligence support and targeting assistance. Four of the wealthy Gulf states involved \u2013 Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Bahrain and the UAE \u2013 are home to key U.S. military bases and are participating in the campaign against ISIS in Iraq and Syria. \u201cFor the U.S., Yemen is just not that important, especially when you have bigger issues like wrapping up the Iranian nuclear negotiations,\u201d says Alley. \u201cThe Saudis have brought significant weight to bear on pressuring their allies to support them. Why cross them and create tension?\u201d<\/p>\n<p><b>S<\/b>INCE THE HOUTHIS TOOK OVER Sana\u2019a, their five-line slogan has become ubiquitous, affixed at checkpoints and chanted at noisy political rallies:<\/p>\n<p><i>God is great<\/i><\/p>\n<p><i>Death to America<\/i><\/p>\n<p><i>Death to Israel<\/i><\/p>\n<p><i>A curse upon the Jews<\/i><\/p>\n<p><i>Victory to Islam<\/i><\/p>\n<p class=\"pullQuote\">\u201cWHEREVER THERE IS UNITED STATES INTERFERENCE, THERE IS AL QAEDA,\u201d SAYS ONE REBEL. \u201cIT\u2019S TO THEIR ADVANTAGE.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>With their echo of the Iranian revolutionaries\u2019 infamous battle cry, the Houthis \u2013 who call themselves Ansar Allah, or Partisans of God \u2013 have presented an increasingly vexing enigma to the United States. They are often portrayed as a sectarian Shiite militia and combatants in a larger proxy war between Iran and Saudi Arabia that\u2019s taking place in Iraq and Syria. In an op-ed in <i>The New York Times<\/i> in April, Hadi, the exiled Saudi-backed president, warned that the Houthis were \u201cpuppets of the Iranian government,\u201d a threat to the region\u2019s shipping lanes and \u201cdestined to become the next Hezbollah.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In Western media, the conflict has been cast in sectarian tones, with the shorthand reference, as the same newspaper\u2019s editorial board put it in early July, to \u201can indigenous Shiite group allied with Iran.\u201d The truth is far more complex and grounded in Yemen\u2019s highly diverse society and tangled politics. For example, the Houthis are actually Zaydi Shiites, which is a different sect from Iranian Twelver Shiism, and closer in doctrine and tradition to Yemen\u2019s Sunni majority.<\/p>\n<p>At a hotel in downtown Sana\u2019a, I meet with Mohammed al-Bukhaiti, a senior Houthi official and member of Ansar Allah\u2019s political committee. A short, broad-shouldered man with close-cropped stubble, Bukhaiti moves around the capital with a Kalashnikov and two bodyguards. A longtime political activist against Saleh\u2019s regime, he had spent years in exile in Canada and is quick to reminisce about its fast-food chains and friendly people. He is unapologetic, though, about Ansar Allah\u2019s anti-American ideology, which holds U.S. imperialism responsible for much of the Middle East\u2019s troubles. \u201cLook what happened in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria and now Yemen,\u201d he says. \u201cWherever there is U.S. interference, there is Al Qaeda and ISIS. It\u2019s to their advantage.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The Houthis\u2019 philosophy both looks back to Islam\u2019s original Sunni-Shia schism in the seventh century A.D. and forward to a contemporary global opposition to U.S. dominance that includes an admiration for Latin American leftism. \u201cWe should repeat the experience of the people of South America,\u201d he says. \u201cThey enlightened themselves about the danger of American policy.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>When I point out that Ansar Allah\u2019s slogan is anti-Semitic, Bukhaiti insists that they are not against Jews as a people, but Israel\u2019s treatment of Palestinians. \u201cIf we were around during the time of the Nazis, we would support the Jews,\u201d he says.<\/p>\n<p>The mixture of Islamism and Che Guevara is clearly influenced by the radical ideology of the Iranian Revolution, and Ansar Allah has warm relations with Iran and the other militant groups it supports, as Bukhaiti openly acknowledges. \u201cIran, Hamas, Hezbollah \u2013 what unites us is that we are against American imperialism. It\u2019s not something that we hide. We\u2019re proud of it.\u201d But he denies that they receive material support from Iran, or are in any way indebted to them: \u201cWe will never allow Iran to come here and use Yemen against any other country.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The Houthis are not a monolithic group, and during the National Dialogue Conference in 2013, which was supposed to determine Yemen\u2019s new political order, they advanced a surprisingly liberal agenda, one that supported limited women\u2019s rights and placed Islamic law as only one of the sources for legislation. But their critics see them returning to their core identity as a militia in response to the pressures of war, especially in the wake the assassinations of Houthi intellectuals like Ahmad Sharafeddin, killed on his way to the National Dialogue\u2019s final plenary session. \u201cThe problem is not that [the Houthi delegates] weren\u2019t genuine but that they were powerless,\u201d says the Carnegie Center\u2019s Muslimi.<\/p>\n<p>The Houthis see themselves as the only party in Yemen that has been truly committed to and effective in battling Al Qaeda. Bukhaiti points out that both the former Saleh regime and the Saudis have had ambiguous relationships with Sunni jihadists, seeking to use them for their own ends. He tries to portray Ansar Allah\u2019s takeover as defensive in nature: \u201cIf we withdraw from the South now, Al Qaeda will fill the vacuum.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"\/var\/site_2923\/storage\/images\/media2\/images\/f0057-017\/38669-1-eng-GB\/f0057-012.jpg\" width=\"825\" height=\"585\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0057-01\" title=\"f0057-01\" \/>\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>NO END IN SIGHT<\/b><\/p>\n<p>(1) Saudi-led airstrikes have led to mass destruction.<\/p>\n <span class=\"credit\">\nCLOCKWISE FROM TOP: SEBASTIANO TOMADA\/GETTY IMAGES REPORTAGE, 2; HANI MOHAMMED\/AP IMAGES, 2<\/span><\/figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    <\/div>\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"\/var\/site_2923\/storage\/images\/media2\/images\/f0057-025\/38662-1-eng-GB\/f0057-022.jpg\" width=\"447\" height=\"435\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0057-02\" title=\"f0057-02\" \/>\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p>(2) Bukhaiti, a rebel leader, with his bodyguards: \u201cWhat unites us is that we are against American imperialism.\u201d When Saleh<\/p>\n<\/figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    <\/div>\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"\/var\/site_2923\/storage\/images\/media2\/images\/f0057-03\/38655-1-eng-GB\/f0057-032.jpg\" width=\"167\" height=\"197\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0057-03\" title=\"f0057-03\" \/>\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p>(3) was replaced by Hadi<\/p>\n<\/figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    <\/div>\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"\/var\/site_2923\/storage\/images\/media2\/images\/f0057-04\/38648-1-eng-GB\/f0057-042.jpg\" width=\"173\" height=\"198\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0057-04\" title=\"f0057-04\" \/>\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p>(4) as president, there was hope for reform, but the country descended into chaos.<\/p>\n<\/figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    <\/div><p>At their office in Sana\u2019a, I visit Radyha al-Mutawakel and Abdulrasheed al-Faqih, a married couple who run Mwatana, one of the few independent and active human rights nongovernmental organizations in Yemen. They are both diminutive and gentle-mannered, and finish each other\u2019s sentences in their soft voices; they expect any day that Ansar Allah might arrest them or shut them down. Mwatana had documented the abuses that the Houthis had suffered under Saleh\u2019s counterinsurgency war; now, the tables are turned, with Amnesty International accusing the militia of torturing protesters in an attempt to suppress any opposition. \u201cOnce the Houthis took power, they became the main source of violations,\u201d says Mutawakel. \u201cThey are doing extrajudicial detentions and attacking media and civil society.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Since the start of the war, Ansar Allah has raided a number of media outlets and NGOs, particularly ones connected to its principal rival, the Yemeni branch of the Muslim Brotherhood. Opposing politicians have also been arrested and held without charge. Yemen\u2019s judicial system has largely broken down, and those detained by the Houthis lack any access to due process. \u201cAnyone who speaks out against the Houthis, they take him,\u201d says Faqih. \u201cThe worst might be yet to come.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><b>T<\/b>HE MAIN REASON WHY Saudi Arabia views Yemen as such a vital strategic interest \u2013 and its Achilles\u2019 heel \u2013 is the 1,100-mile border between the two countries, which stretches over remote and mountainous terrain. Saada Province, on the Yemeni side, is the Houthis\u2019 traditional stronghold, and since the start of the war, fighting between Ansar Allah and the Saudi army has escalated. \u201cThey\u2019re a big challenge to the Saudis militarily,\u201d says Muslimi. \u201cThe Houthis have nothing to lose. They can send thousands of people to the borders to die.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The Saudis have responded by intensively bombing and shelling northern Yemen. On May 8th, in a move reminiscent of the U.S.\u2019s \u201cfreefire zones\u201d in Vietnam, Saudi Arabia declared the cities of Sadaa and Marran to be \u201cmilitary targets\u201d and reportedly dropped leaflets warning the entire civilian population to leave by 7 p.m. that evening.<\/p>\n<p>Both Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International have accused Saudi Arabia of violating international humanitarian law. \u201cThe strikes killing civilians, in which there was no apparent military target, show at least a cruel indifference,\u201d says Belkis Wille of Human Rights Watch. \u201cBomb attacks that deliberately or recklessly targeted civilians would amount to war crimes.\u201d (A representative at the Saudi embassy in Washington, D.C., did not respond to a request for comment.)<\/p>\n<p>Yet there was little news from Saada; no Western journalists had visited since the start of the war. Even the Red Cross had to temporarily abandon its office there. The only foreigners left were a medical team from Doctors Without Borders (also known by its French initials as MSF) that was holed up in a hospital in Saada City.<\/p>\n<p>Getting there meant driving the highway 115 miles north from the capital, through arid mountains with bright-green irrigated valleys slashed through them. Saada has long been one of the most traditional parts of Yemen, and the villages here are built like fortresses from the mud they sit on, with three-story crenellated towers and slitted turrets that stand watch over verdant fields of khat, the popular local stimulant.<\/p>\n<p>Once we reach the border of Saada Province, every few miles we encounter a charred hulk by the side of the road, or a massive crater that forces us to divert into the fields around it. Saudi jets have been targeting vehicles traveling the highway. Most of the recognizable wrecks are oil tankers or heavy trucks, but others are clearly ordinary vehicles \u2013 we pass a blasted flatbed with dozens of little dead goats scattered around it, and another damaged, abandoned pickup that is loaded with sacks of onions. The checkpoints here are mostly deserted \u2013 many bear damage from airstrikes \u2013 and the few vehicles we cross on the road are driving as fast as they can. From time to time, we can hear the rumble of a jet somewhere high above us.<\/p>\n<p>When we arrive in Saada City, the devastation becomes apparent. On the deserted main road, two thin lanes have been cleared in the rubble and dust. On each side is a long stretch of shattered apartments and shops, their metal shutters crumpled like discarded tissue paper. Other buildings have been flattened by bomb strikes, their concrete f loors pancaking down. We turn a corner and head into the old section of the city, where elaborate mud houses have been pulverized. Skirting a massive crater in front of the 1,200-year-old Imam al-Hadi mosque \u2013 it is deep enough to swallow a city bus \u2013 we pull into al-Jumhouri Hospital.<\/p>\n<p>The hospital is a relative safe haven in Saada due to the presence of the MSF team, who had arrived in May. \u201cThey won\u2019t target us because of the foreigners,\u201d says Mohammad Hajjar, the hospital\u2019s director, a tall man with a permanently creased brow. When the bombing started, much of the hospital\u2019s staff fled, but Hajjar had remained behind with a small crew, bolstered by volunteers. Outside of the city, the public-health system in Saada has largely collapsed, with the U.N. rating Saada as the only province in Yemen that was \u201cimpossible or nearly impossible\u201d to access.<\/p>\n<p>The MSF team has set up two big overflow tents in the courtyard outside the ER; the week before we arrived, they had treated around 200 patients. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen what I\u2019ve seen here,\u201d says Maria Green, an Argentine nurse who was the medical team\u2019s leader. She and her colleagues have been working nonstop since arriving and have barely slept from the constant airstrikes at night, some of them in close proximity to the compound. She has treated victims from the wars in Syria and the Central African Republic, but has found the results of modern air power shocking.<\/p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"\/var\/site_2923\/storage\/images\/media2\/images\/f0058-017\/38641-1-eng-GB\/f0058-012.jpg\" width=\"775\" height=\"521\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0058-01\" title=\"f0058-01\" \/>\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>CASUALTIES OF WAR<\/b><\/p>\n<p>(1) MSF doctors treating a civilian in Sadaa.

Even if they can get to Sana\u2019a, medical supplies are drying up as the blockade wears on. For example, Hajjar tells me they have been surprised by a surge in snakebite victims; the bombings are so fierce that serpents swarm out of the ground, or else people encounter them when they flee their homes for the forest and caves. Hospital staff searched for antivenom in Sana\u2019a but were able to find only five vials. \u201cWe are in a terrible situation,\u201d Hajjar says. \u201cIf the Saudis could blockade the air we breathe, they would.\u201d He says the hospital only has about 10 days of fuel left, and without it, its generators and intensive-care machines will stop. \u201cWe\u2019ve had three fuel tankers try to deliver, and they\u2019ve all been attacked on the road and destroyed,\u201d he says.<\/p>\n<p>At the hospital, I meet Fatehi Betal, who is part of a local Houthi-affiliated civil council that is documenting the airstrikes. His family fled when the bombing started and their home had been reduced to rubble. A 24-year-old with rimless glasses and a tense expression that occasionally breaks into a youthful smile, Betal shows me the notes and photos that he has accumulated. According to his count, 341 civilians have been killed in the province since the start of the war. \u201cSaada is different from other cities in Yemen,\u201d he says.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThey target any gathering. We can\u2019t even pray in the mosque.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Leaving the safe confines of the hospital, Betal takes me on a macabre tour of the city\u2019s destruction. Saada\u2019s old souk, once packed with spice and textile sellers, is half-destroyed and empty except for stray dogs lying forlornly where the butcher shops had once been. We visit a car sales lot filled with charred wrecks, a blasted water bottling factory, and cratered restaurants and shopping plazas. Betal shows us the casing of a cluster bomb, and a half-exploded 1,000-pound bomb, both made in the U.S. The post office, central bank and cellphone network have been wiped out. Almost all the gas stations in Saada have been hit; at the Jarman station, there is a long line of incinerated vehicles. An airstrike had hit it while drivers were lined up for gasoline. \u201cNineteen people were killed, some burned beyond recongition,\u201d he says.<\/p>\n<p>According to a U.N. satellite analysis, 1,171 structures in Saada City had been damaged or destroyed by airstrikes as of May 17th. The pattern of targets suggests that Saudi Arabia was focusing on Saada\u2019s infrastructure in an attempt to destroy its economy and flush out its civilian population.<\/p>\n<p>I am told by the hospital staff that things are even worse in the rural border areas. The same day that we arrive at the hospital, there is news that there has been a strike in Radha, a remote village several hours away by road. Sure enough, that afternoon a procession of pickups screech into the hospital compound. The medical staff wheel up stretchers and pull bloodied figures out of the trucks. Soon there are bright-red spatters on the clean emergency-room floor as the hospital staff prepare patients for the operating theater. I ask a man leaning wearily against the back of a pickup, his clothes stained with his uncle\u2019s dried blood, what has happened.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt was just after lunch, and people were leaving their houses,\u201d the man, Saleh Khairan, says. \u201cThere was a huge cluster bomb. We heard hundreds of explosions. They must have hit 50 houses, and at least one person from each house was killed or injured.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>With gasoline so scarce, Khairan had been forced to pay a driver $350 to make the three-and-a-half-hour drive to Saada City, an expense the family can scarcely afford. \u201cWe\u2019re too poor to leave,\u201d he says. \u201cThere are no military bases near us or anything. This was the first time we\u2019ve been attacked in this war, but they\u2019ve been using cluster bombs in the surrounding areas.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>We drive out to the village of Sabr, about a half-hour outside the city, where hospital officials have told us one of the worst civilian-casualty incidents had occurred. The countryside we pass through is lush \u2013 Saada is known as the fruit basket of Yemen \u2013 but the fields and mud houses we pass look deserted. \u201cIt\u2019s mostly shepherds left,\u201d says Betal.<\/p>\n<p>Sabr was an austere cluster of mud homes, some of them elaborate threestory forts. Half of it had been reduced to churned rubble. Two older residents, dressed in long robes and shawls, join us and tell us what had happened.<\/p>\n<p class=\"pullQuote\">\u201cI\u2019VE NEVER SEEN WHAT I\u2019VE SEEN HERE,\u201d SAYS A NURSE WHO\u2019S TREATED VICTIMS FROM WARS IN SYRIA AND AFRICA.<\/p>\n<p>On June 3rd, they say, an airstrike had hit several houses. Then, as the villagers worked to free victims from their collapsed homes, another wave of strikes had hit them. Betal arrived in an ambulance; he says the locals were hysterical and afraid to go back to try to rescue anyone. In all, they say, eight houses had been destroyed and 51 people killed. They produce a list of names with ages next to them \u2013 36 of the victims were children. \u201cThese are their homes,\u201d Salem Ali says, pointing to the rubble. \u201cMy father\u2019s house is there.\u201d They claim there were no Houthi fighters or military targets in the village. \u201cWe don\u2019t know why they attacked us,\u201d he says.<\/p>\n<p>It is impossible to verify their figures independently, but the MSF team confirm that there had been a large number of injured and killed who were brought to the hospital from the bombing in Sabr, their biggest incident to date, including eight children, many of them victims of asphyxiation or trauma from being trapped under the rubble.<\/p>\n<p>As we speak, the recurring rumble of a Saudi jet grows louder and louder. It seems to be making circles over the valley, searching for targets. I imagine how we\u2019d look from one of those infrared-camera videos they always play on TV: several pickup trucks full of men converge in a village and congregate together in some sort of meeting. Everyone looks suspicious as a ghostly infrared silhouette on those bomb-camera videos, and their evaporation in a white flash at the end feels justified and even satisfying.<\/p>\n<p>The sound of the plane is excruciating. \u201cI guess you must be used to hearing the sound of the jets all day,\u201d I say to the men, trying to sound light-hearted. \u201cI\u2019m not, so it really makes me nervous.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cNormally, we would run away when we hear it this close,\u201d Ali replies, \u201cbut you are here with us and we don\u2019t want to make you afraid.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><b>E<\/b>VEN BEFORE THE WAR, MANY Yemenis lived in precarious poverty. About half the population lacked access to clean water, and the country imported 90 percent of its food from abroad. But the outbreak of heavy fighting, and in particular the blockade, has pushed them into a genuine humanitarian disaster. In June, the U.N. raised Yemen\u2019s crisis status to Category 3, its highest level, shared only by Syria, South Sudan and Iraq. And yet since the beginning of the conflict, the U.N. and the rest of the humanitarian community have struggled to deliver aid.<\/p>\n<p>On our way back from Saada, we stop in Khamir, a small town set amid the rolling hills two hours north of the capital. Much of Saada\u2019s population has escaped to neighboring areas like this, part of a mass exodus of Yemeni civilians who have fled their homes and are desperately in need of assistance.<\/p>\n<p>At the district hospital, I walk through the pediatric ward with Emmanuel Berbain, a French doctor who is part of a long-running MSF project here. In contrast to the mad urgency of the hospital in Saada, the ward has a funereal air, as black-robed, veiled mothers keep a silent vigil over the patients \u2013 there is nothing more somber than a roomful of silent children.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cMalnutrition is one of the side effects of the war and the blockade,\u201d Berbain says, examining a small boy who looks deflated from severe diarrhea. The influx of internally displaced persons, or IDPs, to Khamir means a surge in preventable illnesses: \u201cLeishmaniasis, malaria, rickets.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In Yemen\u2019s traditional society, many IDPs are able to find shelter with their extended families, and others have been accommodated in government facilities like schools. Some, though, are simply on their own. Berbain and I jump into an MSF van and ride out to the edge of town, to an area known as the Khat Market, though it is just a series of barren, stepped fields overlooking the town. It is scattered with tents pitched on the open ground, some of them muddy old U.N. Refugee Agency shelters from past conf licts, others just tarps on sticks. \u201cThey basically have nothing. No food, no water,\u201d Berbain says. The U.N. hasn\u2019t shown up. A note of disbelief entered his voice. \u201cThere is no food distribution in all of Khamir.\u201d (A U.N. spokesman says food aid arrived in July.)<\/p>\n<p>As we drove past one group of tents, Berbain tells the driver to stop, and he chats with a woman and asks if her child\u2019s itching had subsided yet. When we continued on, he pointed to some stray mutts lurking near the tents. \u201cThe dogs are shitting in the fields, and it spreads diseases,\u201d he explains. \u201cTheir child has ancylostomiasis.\u201d He makes a clawing motion against his chest: \u201cIt\u2019s worms moving under the skin.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>As we tour the camp, Berbain is incredulous that the U.N. and the rest of the international humanitarian community are simply allowing people to die of starvation and exposure. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing. How is it possible that there can be so many IDPs without any response?\u201d he says. \u201cAnd it\u2019s getting worse every day.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>International funding for aid has been slow to arrive to Yemen. When the U.N. issued a \u201cflash appeal\u201d for $274 million in aid in April, the Saudi government immediately pledged the entire amount. As of mid-July, none of the money had been delivered. \u201cWhen the Saudis committed right off the bat, it made a lot of other donors relax the urgency on their contributions,\u201d says an official in charge of an international agency operating in Yemen. \u201cEveryone\u2019s wondering if this is what the Saudis intended, or if they simply committed all the money without realizing they would not be in charge of where it went.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The biggest constraint on aid, however, remains the Saudi coalition\u2019s blockade of Yemen\u2019s airports, borders and shipping. Critics in the humanitarian community say it amounts to the collective punishment of an entire nation, and an example of siege warfare against civilian populations that is forbidden under international law. Saudi Arabia has disputed the term \u201cblockade\u201d and refers to the enforcement of a \u201crestricted zone\u201d and \u201ccontrolled maritime area,\u201d whose purpose is to interdict Iranian weapons. While the coalition does allow some approved shipping into the country, the flow of essential goods has been strangled to a trickle. At the end of June, the U.N. estimated that Yemen was getting only 11 percent of its prewar fuel imports, and the gas shortage had drastically impeded aid delivery across the country.<\/p>\n<p>The U.N. and the rest of the humanitarian community have been desperately pushing for a cease-fire, with little success. The U.N. special envoy, Ismail Ould Cheikh Ahmed, has been shuttling back and forth between Sana\u2019a, Riyadh and Geneva, trying to kick-start peace negotiations that no one seems interested in. Both the Houthis and Hadi\u2019s government sent teams to Geneva in June for talks, but nothing came of it. And Ahmed was embarrassed in July when, a day after the announcement that he had brokered a ceasefire for the final week of Ramadan, Saudi jets continued bombing Yemen and the Houthis continued fighting on the ground. The Saudis said that they did not recognize the cease-fire.<\/p>\n<p><b>D<\/b>URING MY VISIT, THE QUESTION that I am most frequently asked by Yemenis is, \u201cWhat do you think will happen to us?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Yemen\u2019s Byzantine, fractious politics seem to confound even experienced observers. And yet, looking at what has already happened in Libya, Iraq and Syria, there seemed to be a precedent. Yemen\u2019s war will intensify. Rival sides will splinter into even smaller, more brutal militias. Regional powers will pour fuel on the fire in the pursuit of their own rivalries and domestic agendas, despite the risk of blowback. The international community will stand by helplessly. A massive human tragedy will unfold, shattering millions of lives and sending refugees into teeming camps and to the shores of an unwelcoming West. And a succession of increasingly nihilistic jihadist groups, the war\u2019s only winners, will thrive and pose a grave threat to the world.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe world hasn\u2019t learned anything from the Syrian experience,\u201d Faqih, the human rights activist, tells me. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening in Yemen is creating an environment that encourages jihadist groups. They have been dreaming of this day.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>It may not be too late for Yemen. It may be that the genies of war and sectarian madness can somehow be put back in their bottles. If the U.S. can pressure Saudi Arabia and the coalition into ceasing the bombing and blockade, and in return the Houthis agree to stop their march on the rest of the country; if Saudi Arabia and Iran can be persuaded to leave Yemen out of their rivalry; and all sides within Yemen return to the table at Geneva \u2013 then maybe, just maybe, the country has a chance.<\/p>\n<p>Faqih looks out the window. \u201cI think the worst case is coming, without a miracle,\u201d he says, and chuckles bitterly. \u201cAnd there are no miracles.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>On the night before Ramadan begins \u2013 my last night in Yemen \u2013 a series of car bombs go off around Sana\u2019a. Three hit mosques in the city, and another targets the offices of Ansar Allah\u2019s political committee. At the scene, I meet Bukhaiti, the Houthi leader I had interviewed, examining a hunk of twisted metal that had been a Hyundai Sonata. The bombings would soon be claimed by ISIS, but Bukhaiti isn\u2019t in the mood to make distinctions. \u201cThe Saudis, as well as Al Qaeda and ISIS \u2013 it\u2019s all the same,\u201d he says, his face made gaunt by the beam of a flashlight. \u201cWe\u2019re expecting that there will be more.\u201d<\/p>\n","layout":{},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":0,"link_source":"","competition":[],"flatplan_title":"","notes":"","gutter_credit":"","other":"","image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1467287650.5859","name":"f0052-01","source":"","caption":"<p>The old city of Sana\u2019a after a Saudi airstrike destroyed several homes<\/p>\n","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http:\/\/cdn-assets.ziniopro.com\/var\/site_2923\/storage\/images\/media2\/images\/f0052-017\/38690-1-eng-GB\/f0052-012.jpg?t=default_ipad_portrait&ext\/f0052-012_default_ipad_portrait.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"768","height":"868","legacy_id":"4057","is_default":true},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1467287650.5859","name":"f0052-01","source":"","caption":"<p>The old city of Sana\u2019a after a Saudi airstrike destroyed several homes<\/p>\n","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http:\/\/cdn-assets.ziniopro.com\/var\/site_2923\/storage\/images\/media2\/images\/f0052-017\/38690-1-eng-GB\/f0052-012.jpg?t=default_ipad_landscape&ext\/f0052-012_default_ipad_landscape.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"680","height":"768","legacy_id":"4057","is_default":false}],"related_objects":{"image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_9_1467287640.8935","name":"f0058-03","source":"","caption":"<p>(3) More than a million civilians have fled their homes; IDP camps have sprung up, but disease and hunger plague the refugees.<\/p>\n","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http:\/\/cdn-assets.ziniopro.com\/var\/site_2923\/storage\/images\/media2\/images\/f0058-03\/38627-1-eng-GB\/f0058-032.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"456","height":"401","legacy_id":"4048"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_9_1467287640.8935","name":"f0058-03","source":"","caption":"<p>(3) More than a million civilians have fled their homes; IDP camps have sprung up, but disease and hunger plague the refugees.<\/p>\n","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http:\/\/cdn-assets.ziniopro.com\/var\/site_2923\/storage\/images\/media2\/images\/f0058-03\/38627-1-eng-GB\/f0058-032.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"456","height":"401","legacy_id":"4048"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_8_1467287641.7836","name":"f0058-02","source":"","caption":"<p>(2) Houthi fighters on patrol.<\/p>\n","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http:\/\/cdn-assets.ziniopro.com\/var\/site_2923\/storage\/images\/media2\/images\/f0058-023\/38634-1-eng-GB\/f0058-022.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"453","height":"416","legacy_id":"4049"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_8_1467287641.7836","name":"f0058-02","source":"","caption":"<p>(2) Houthi fighters on patrol.<\/p>\n","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http:\/\/cdn-assets.ziniopro.com\/var\/site_2923\/storage\/images\/media2\/images\/f0058-023\/38634-1-eng-GB\/f0058-022.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"453","height":"416","legacy_id":"4049"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_7_1467287642.7629","name":"f0058-01","source":"SEBASTIANO TOMADA\/GETTY IMAGES REPORTAGE, 3","caption":"<p><b>CASUALTIES OF WAR<\/b><\/p>\n<p>(1) MSF doctors treating a civilian in Sadaa.
