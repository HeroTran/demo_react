Considering that heavy rep, it\u2019s strange to think that when Jeff Tweedy put together Wilco\u2019s first lineup 20 years ago, their loose bar-band vibe was a defiant response to the weighty myth he\u2019d shouldered as a member of alt-country pioneers Uncle Tupelo. Wilco\u2019s first album in four years recalls their early \u201chey, what the hell\u201d freedom, in spirit if not in sound. It\u2019s their most concise, catchy, naturally songful album in at least a decade \u2013 the sound of a band reconnecting with the fun of rocking out together in a room.<\/p>\n<p>Wilco\u2019s two most recent studio LPs \u2013 2011\u2019s <i>The Whole Love<\/i> and 2009\u2019s <i>Wilco (The Album)<\/i> \u2013 were musically lavish, but also a touch staid, with their rough edges burnished to a too-smooth finish. Everything about <i>Star Wars<\/i> betrays ease and immediacy: They released it online for free with no warning. The jokey title references one of the most universally held pleasures in the history of human culture. The music is built on some pretty essential influences as well \u2013 from the <i>Abbey Road<\/i> majesty of \u201cMore . . .\u201d and the rough-necked T. Rex shoogity-oogity of \u201cRandom Name Generator\u201d to the basementglam punk attack of \u201cPickled Ginger\u201d and the sad-ballad sweetness of \u201cMagnetized.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Wilco have gotten back in touch with their own strengths, too \u2013 especially the ability to match instantly familiar melodies with beautifully jarring noise, which made 2002\u2019s <i>Yankee Hotel Foxtrot<\/i> and 1996\u2019s <i>Being There<\/i> into watersheds. \u201cThe Joke Explained\u201d is a cute folk-rock ditty made full-on awesome by peals of searing Sonic Youth-style drone poetry. And then there\u2019s \u201cYou Satellite,\u201d the incandescent jam that serves as the album\u2019s elusive centerpiece. It\u2019s a seething yet warm meditation on clinging to faint light in dark times, with what sounds like a battalion of guitars roiling against drummer Glenn Kotche\u2019s avant-jazz tumble. Only Wilco could make something this eruptive feel so comfy, like a steel-wool security blanket.<\/p>\n<p>The music\u2019s urgent, live-inthe-studio feel pairs well with Tweedy\u2019s lyrics, which seem more direct and compact than they have in a while. He\u2019s working his usual themes \u2013 doubt, devotion, everyday fears and resigned hopes \u2013 without any of the literary obscurity that sometimes creeps into his writing. \u201cI was only after a friend to follow through,\u201d he sings on the lovely \u201cTaste the Ceiling,\u201d sounding like John Lennon in a moment of hard-fought grace. You can\u2019t help wonder if <i>Sukierae,<\/i> the deeply personal side project he recorded last year with his teenage son Spencer on drums, might have helped revive Tweedy\u2019s feel for music\u2019s elemental joy.<\/p>\n<p>In the album\u2019s most carefree moments, of which there are many, he sounds at home in himself \u2013 never an easy move for one of rock\u2019s top chroniclers of midlife man-malaise. \u201cI belong to the stars in the sky,\u201d he sings on \u201cRandom Name Generator,\u201d making a blues boast out of spacey poesy and totally pulling it off . Give it up for the man. He\u2019s got the Force by the spaceballs.<\/p>\n<p><b>LISTEN NOW!<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Hear key tracks from<\/p>\n<p>these albums at<\/p>\n<p><b><a href=\"http:\/\/RollingStone.com\/albums\" target=\"_self\">RollingStone.com\/albums<\/a>.<\/b><\/p>\n<p>\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Classic | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Excellent | \u2605\u2605\u2605 Good | \u2605\u2605 Fair | \u2605 Poor Ratings are supervised by the editors of ROLLING STONE.<\/p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"\/var\/site_2923\/storage\/images\/media2\/images\/f0063-013\/38908-1-eng-GB\/f0063-012.jpg\" width=\"104\" height=\"103\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0063-01\" title=\"f0063-01\" \/>\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<\/figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    <\/div><h3><b>Fraser A.

Even so, Mondanile doesn\u2019t simply reproduce the dynamic of his main band: A pair of drowsy instrumentals and three songs featuring vocals from arty composer Julia Holter add to a pleasantly diff use vibe that\u2019s all his own.<\/p>\n<p><b>DAVID TURNER<\/b><\/p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"\/var\/site_2923\/storage\/images\/media2\/images\/f0064-08\/38824-1-eng-GB\/f0064-082.jpg\" width=\"105\" height=\"101\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0064-08\" title=\"f0064-08\" \/>\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<\/figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    <\/div><h3><b>Four Tet<\/b><\/h3><p><i>Morning\/Evening<\/i> Text<\/p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"\/var\/site_2923\/storage\/images\/media2\/images\/f0064-09\/38817-1-eng-GB\/f0064-092.jpg\" width=\"64\" height=\"15\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0064-09\" title=\"f0064-09\" \/>\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<\/figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    <\/div><p><b>British beat genius digs into his South Asian family roots<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Four Tet\u2019s music has moved deeper into the dance f loor since his folk-tinged 2003 landmark, <i>Rounds,<\/i> but it hasn\u2019t become any less exquisite or psychedelic.

 \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<\/figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    <\/div><p>Released in 1982, two years after the death of drummer John Bonham, <i>Coda<\/i> was a late goodbye from the rest of Led Zeppelin \u2013 singer Robert Plant, bassist John Paul Jones and founding guitarist Jimmy Page \u2013 and paltry closure for everyone else: a mere half-hour of outtakes, including a drum solo. Three tracks were unused songs from 1979\u2019s <i>In Through the Out Door,<\/i> an awkward embrace of New Wave electronics and pop romanticism. The contrast between those songs and <i>Coda<\/i>\u2019s opener, the early-prime bonfire \u201cWe\u2019re Gonna Groove,\u201d was not flattering. For the first time, in that threadbare collection, the most audacious hard-rock band of the Seventies sounded like a spent force.<\/p>\n<p>Three decades later, <i>Coda<\/i> is the unlikely closing triumph in Page\u2019s series of deluxe Zeppelin reissues: a dynamic pocket history in rarities, across three discs with 15 bonus tracks, of his band\u2019s epic-blues achievement. There are familiar strays, such as \u201cBaby Come On Home,\u201d from the sessions for 1969\u2019s <i>Led Zeppelin,<\/i> and the 1970 B side \u201cHey, Hey, What Can I Do.\u201d But Page has gone deep.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cSugar Mama,\u201d cut for and left off <i>Led Zeppelin,<\/i> already suggests the tightly wound textural fury of <i>Led Zeppelin II.<\/i> \u201cIf It Keeps On Raining\u201d is a truly alternate take of \u201cWhen the Levee Breaks,\u201d on <i>Led Zeppelin IV<\/i> \u2013 less titanic, with more worried-blues nuance in Plant\u2019s vocal \u2013 and two long-bootlegged 1972 recordings by Page and Plant, made in India with members of the Bombay Orchestra, evoke their determined exploration of the global routes and branches in American blues and Celtic folk, on the way to the rugged spectacle of 1975\u2019s <i>Physical Graffiti.<\/i><\/p>\n<p>Page\u2019s final round of reissues includes two other sets: new editions of <i>In Through the Out Door<\/i> and the feral-guitar overload of 1976\u2019s <i>Presence.<\/i> The extra mixes essentially mirror the original LPs, with a refreshing exception: \u201c10 Ribs &amp; All\/Carrot Pod Pod (Pod),\u201d an instrumental sketch from the <i>Presence<\/i> sessions starring Jones\u2019 jazznocturne piano. Even in <i>Coda\u2019<\/i>s expanded context, the <i>Out Door<\/i> orphans \u201cOzone Baby\u201d and \u201cDarlene\u201d are still lesser Zeppelin, an inconclusive response to the edge and concision of punk.<\/p>\n<p>Rebirth, of course, was not an option; Bonham\u2019s death froze his band\u2019s legacy in place. Yet it\u2019s a story that keeps on giving. Once an afterthought, <i>Coda<\/i> is now a classic Led Zeppelin album: deep lore from their road to legend.<\/p>\n<p><b>DAVID FRICKE<\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>KEY TRACK:<\/b> \u201cIf It Keeps On

indie-rock fans who prize delicately demented pop, Mac DeMarco has the casual grace of early Beck, bringing a shambolic scuzz to the creamy sounds of Seventies soft rock. His melodies and slide guitar stumble and dance their way through songs that often feel like reverse Polaroids: A fully developed image fades into haze as you watch.<\/p>\n<p>Over the course of four releases since 2012 \u2013 not one of them more than 35 minutes long \u2013 the Canadian singersongwriter has continually upped the ante without exactly playing high stakes, and this eight-track mini-LP is his craftiest set of tunes yet. The lyrics are full of heartbreak and longing, with DeMarco\u2019s voice and guitar threading through melancholy keyboards like a cat looking for a sunbeam in a room with the shades drawn. \u201cWho could that be knocking at her door?\u201d he asks in the title track, as he ponders love and trust slipping away. \u201cMust be another one she loves.\u201d DeMarco has said that this is his stab at universal pop \u2013 everyone has found and lost love, after all. Sometimes it\u2019s all too universal: A chorus like \u201cbelieve me, I\u2019ve been waiting for her\u201d has both a winning simplicity and a numbing familiarity. But at their best, these songs have a charm that\u2019s aching and amiable.<\/p>\n<p class=\"byline\"><b>JOE LEVY<\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>KEY TRACKS:<\/b> \u201cAnother One,\u201d \u201cWithout

As producer as well as star, Cruise puts a new director in charge of every movie. So far at the helm, since 1996, we\u2019ve had Brian De Palma, John Woo, J.J. Abrams and Brad Bird (his <i>Ghost Protocol<\/i> is my fave and the biggest box-office hit in the bunch). Cruise, 53, will presumably play IMF (Impossible Mission Force) undercover agent Ethan Hunt until he\u2019s eligible for AARP. Fine by me. Back in a galaxy far, far away (1986\u2019s <i>Top Gun)<\/i>, Cruise had a killer line: \u201cI feel the need, the need for speed.\u201d He\u2019s still feeling it. This dude can run, jump, climb, ride and fight like a muthafucker, often shirtless.<\/p>\n<p>Cruise is back in action for the fifth time, and no worse for wear, in <i>Mission: Impossible \u2013 Rogue Nation<\/i>. The director is Christopher McQuarrie, who cooked up something moody and intense with Cruise in 2012\u2019s <i>Jack Reacher.<\/i> But Mc-Quarrie has never worked on this huge a scale, and the strain to go big and bigger sometimes shows. The movie begins with Ethan hanging from the side of an Airbus A400M cargo plane during takeoff. Why? That kind of question is irrelevant in a franchise in which action trumps logic at every turn.<\/p>\n<p>And yet, McQuarrie \u2013 an Oscar winner for his script for 1995\u2019s <i>The Usual Suspects<\/i> \u2013 has an ace to play. That\u2019s the indie sensibility he brings to the usual Hollywood FX. Don\u2019t get me wrong. <i>Rogue Nation<\/i> doesn\u2019t skimp on the wow factor, especially a Moroccan motorcycle chase and an underwater sequence that has Ethan whooshing around like a sock during spin cycle. And the laughs kick in whenever Ethan gets help from his miracle-working teammates Benji (Simon Pegg, priceless) and Luther (Ving Rhames). The plot, such as it is, involves Ethan and Agent Brandt (Jeremy Renner) trying to save the IMF from extinction by the CIA, led by an exposition-spouting Alec Baldwin. No one believes Ethan that a mysterious Syndicate is hellbent on seizing global control.<\/p>\n<p>McQuarrie borrows elements of mythical evil from <i>Suspects<\/i> when Ethan and the double-dealing British agent Ilsa Faust (a ready-to-rock Rebecca Ferguson) lock horns with mega-creepy Solomon Lane (Sean Harris), a villain cut from the same cloth as Keyser S\u00f6ze. Harris, best known for <i>The Borgias,<\/i> can\u2019t compete with Kevin Spacey\u2019s iconic S\u00f6ze. Neither can <i>Rogue Nation,<\/i> which succeeds best when McQuarrie channels his inner film geek and stages a spectacular shootout at the Vienna opera house that evokes Hitchcock\u2019s <i>The Man Who Knew Too Much.<\/i> This knockout sequence, in which Cruise fires up everything he has as actor and athlete, shows that <i>Mission: Impossible<\/i> still has gas in its tank even when its engine sputters.<\/p>\n<h3><b>Southpaw<\/b><\/h3><p><i>Jake Gyllenhaal<\/i><\/p>\n<p>Directed by Antoine Fuqua<\/p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"\/var\/site_2923\/storage\/images\/media2\/images\/f0068-063\/39122-1-eng-GB\/f0068-062.jpg\" width=\"47\" height=\"16\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0068-06\" title=\"f0068-06\" \/>\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<\/figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    <\/div><p>JAKE GYLLENHAAL IS ON A roll. Onscreen in <i>Nightcrawler, Enemy<\/i> and <i>Prisoners,<\/i> and onstage in <i>Constellations, Little Shop of Horrors<\/i> and <i>If There Is I Haven\u2019t Found It Yet,<\/i> he shows the kind of versatility and commitment that should have won him prizes. The awards didn\u2019t materialize, but it\u2019s just a matter of time. Maybe it\u2019ll be for <i>Southpaw,<\/i> a retro, in-yourface fight drama that dribbles into sappiness. Much, though far from all, is redeemed by Gyllenhaal\u2019s virtuoso performance. The actor, 34, trained for four months and gained 15 pounds of muscle to play light-heavyweight champ Billy Hope. But the externals \u2013 scars, tattoos and slurred voice \u2013 don\u2019t begin to suggest the emotional depths Gyllenhaal brings to the part of a bruiser on the ropes.<\/p>\n<p>Billy is at the top of his game, but constant jabs have left him punchy. His wife, Maureen (Rachel McAdams), wants him to slow down and enjoy their 11-year-old daughter, Leila (a feisty Oona Laurence). Maureen is way more than lacquered hair, nails and spray tan. She and Billy were raised in Hell\u2019s Kitchen orphanages. McAdams, strong and smoldering, is explosively good. Spoiler alert: Her role is shortened when Maureen is involved in a shooting accident sparked by Miguel Escobar (Miguel Gomez), a fighter who thinks he can goad Billy into taking him on for high stakes.<\/p>\n<p>Director Antoine Fuqua (<i>Training Day, The Equalizer<\/i>), working from an overcooked screenplay by Kurt Sutter (<i>Sons of Anarchy<\/i>), knows he\u2019s not in the same ring with <i>Raging Bull, Rocky, Million Dollar Baby<\/i> and <i>The Fighter<\/i>, though the script unblushingly mooches from each of them. Still, Fuqua shuffles the tools of the genre with genuine flair. As tragedy lands Billy in the pits of desperation, poverty and child-custody battles, Fuqua shifts focus from Billy\u2019s crooked agent (Curtis \u201c50 Cent\u201d Jackson) to a trainersavior, Tick Wills (the expert Forest Whitaker), who teaches Billy a new fighting style that doesn\u2019t involve stopping punches with his head. The powerful boxing scenes, vividly shot from Madison Square Garden to Vegas by Mauro Fiore and edited by John Refoua, help distract from the father-daughter scenes that outdo <i>The Champ<\/i> (the Wallace Beery original and the Jon Voight remake) for gooey sentiment. Amazingly, Gyllenhaal never cheats on his character\u2019s sense of dignity. Against the odds, he keeps you in Billy\u2019s corner. That\u2019s a champ.<\/p>\n<h3><b>Vacation<\/b><\/h3><p><i>Ed Helms, Chevy Chase<\/i><\/p>\n<p>Directed by Jonathan Goldstein and John Francis Daley<\/p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"\/var\/site_2923\/storage\/images\/media2\/images\/f0069-016\/39115-1-eng-GB\/f0069-012.jpg\" width=\"29\" height=\"16\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0069-01\" title=\"f0069-01\" \/>\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<\/figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    <\/div><p>MAYBE NATIONAL L AMpoon\u2019s <i>Vacation<\/i> comedies, begun in 1983, hit your sweet spot.

For a riveting answer, check out <i>The End of the Tour.<\/i> The film is based on the 2010 book <i>Although of Course You End Up Becoming Yourself,<\/i> by Rolling Stone writer David Lipsky. Over five days in 1996, Lipsky (Jesse Eisenberg) interviewed celebrated novelist and essayist David Foster Wallace (Jason Segel, like you\u2019ve never seen him before). It was the end of Wallace\u2019s tour for his magnum opus, <i>Infinite Jest<\/i>. It wasn\u2019t until after the depression-plagued Wallace hanged himself in 2008 that Lipsky used the material in a story that won a National Magazine Award and became the basis for his book. Suicide hangs over the movie as it did the book, scrambling our thoughts and perhaps helping us achieve a greater understanding.<\/p>\n<p>Nothing and everything happen in the movie. Director James Ponsoldt (<i>The Spectacular Now<\/i>), working from a fluid script by playwright Donald Margulies, does justice to the book without compromising his film. This is no biopic. The story takes place when the bandanna-wearing Wallace was at the peak of his success and trying in his own shambling, humane way to deal with it.<\/p>\n<p>From the moment Lipsky, played with seductive intelligence and a secret smile by Eisenberg, arrives at Wallace\u2019s bachelor cave in snowbound Bloomington, Illinois, the scene is set for mesmerizing mind games. The more Lipsky pushes \u2013 his editor (Ron Livingston) wants details of the author\u2019s alleged heroin addiction \u2013 the warier Wallace becomes.<\/p>\n<p>So we watch as Lipsky and Wallace travel by car, bus and jet trying to suss each other out, to touch a nerve, to form a bond. In Minneapolis, they eat junk food and argue pop culture. Then, at dinner with Wallace\u2019s pal Julie (Mamie Gummer) and his former college love Betsy (Mickey Sumner), the low-key author accuses Lipsky of crass flirting. His words sting. Segel, giving the performance of his career, potently catches Wallace\u2019s internal conflicts.<\/p>\n<p>As the details accumulate, so does the power of the film, an illuminating meditation on art and life that hits you hard with its ferocity and feeling. What could have been a static record of a conversation becomes kinetic cinema of startling immediacy. Lipsky wrote, \u201cBooks are a social substitute; you read people who, at one level, you\u2019d like to hang out with.\u201d<i>The End of the Tour<\/i> lets us hang out with two diff erent writers who strive rigorously to never completely let their guard down. Although of course they end up becoming themselves. Right in front of us. That\u2019s what makes the movie, elevated by two extraordinary actors, an exhilarating gift.

Right, Pac-Man and Donkey Kong want to kill us. Our only hope lies with arcade geeks now grown up but still immature and played by Adam Sandler, Josh Gad, Peter Dinklage and Kevin James (he\u2019s the president). Director Chris Columbus surely hopes that today\u2019s teen gamers, hooked on Halo and Call of Duty, will care about what happened 30 years ago. That\u2019s iffy, unless 13-year-olds think it\u2019s a scream when Dinklage asks to be part of a sex sandwich with Serena Williams and Martha Stewart, who both do cameos. Yikes!
