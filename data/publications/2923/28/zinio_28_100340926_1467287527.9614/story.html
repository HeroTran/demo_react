    </div><h3><b>Rush to the Top</b></h3><p>OPENING MY MAILBOX TO see Rush <i>finally</i> on the cover of Rolling Stone [“From Rush With Love,” RS 1238] and then reading such a well-written piece on these “three men of Willowdale” confirms that good things truly do come to those who wait.</p>
<p><i>Russ DiBella, Sicklerville, NJ</i></p>
<p>WHAT AN ENGAGING FEAture by Brian Hiatt. Great musicians and thoughtful people. Their intelligence, humor, commitment to excellence, and humanity are inspirational.</p>
<p><i>Reid Whitton, Syracuse, NY</i></p>
<p>GEDDY LEE CALLS RECORDing the vocals for <i>Hemispheres</i> “just the worst two weeks of my life.” Having listened to <i>Hemispheres</i> at least once a month for the past 37 years, and having loved every minute, I have to ask, “Wasn’t it worth two terrible weeks of your life to give a fan years of musical bliss?”</p>
<p><i>Steve Dobrusin, Detroit</i></p>
<p>I WAS ONCE A ROCK SNOB. IF it wasn’t Zeppelin, Sabbath, Alice Cooper or the other stalwarts, I wanted no part of it. Rush were interlopers. But I had a Rush-fanatic friend who never gave up on me. In 2011, he dragged me to one of the most staggering performances I’ve ever witnessed. Don’t be like me. Last tour? Last chance.</p>
<p><i>Albert Adickes, San Diego</i></p>
<h3><b>Prison Reform</b></h3><p>A SUPERB PIECE ON OUR bloated prison population [“Crime, Politics and Justice,” RS 1238]. Who exactly are we locking up? Draconian sentencing policies are in the news right now as legislators seek an automatic five-year sentence for any immigrant who returns after being deported. Imagine the vulnerable families that will tear apart.</p>
<p><i>Fabian Hays Via the Internet</i></p>
<p>I’M GLAD BILL CLINTON CAN now admit that he “overshot the mark” on incarceration in 1994, but his shortsightedness really galls me.</p>
<p><i>Lee Bates Via the Internet</i></p>
<h3><b>Soul Superstar</b></h3><p>R&amp;B AND RAP ARE REALLY missing message-giving artists like D’Angelo [“The Second Coming of D’Angelo,” RS 1238]. The genre needs more folks who give a darn about what’s going on around them. Brian Hiatt hit this interview out of the park with his candid questions.</p>
<p><i>Matthew Robinson Via the Internet</i></p>
<h3><b>Wilson’s Triumph</b></h3><p>JASON FINE’S LOVELY PROfile of Brian Wilson captured a Beach Boy truly reborn [“Brian Wilson’s Better Days,” RS 1238]. Despite his anxiety, Wilson is touring, recording and enjoying his family. His daughter Daria speaks for all of us who love her brilliant, fragile father.</p>
<p><i>Ronan Gilbert Via the Internet</i></p>
<h3><b>Amy Forever</b></h3><p>EVEN THOUGH I KNOW HOW it turns out, the story of Amy Winehouse continues to break my heart [“The Amy Winehouse We Never Knew,” RS 1238]. Asif Kapadia’s new documentary, <i>Amy,</i> pulls no punches and, I suppose, indicts all of us who loved and consumed her.</p>
