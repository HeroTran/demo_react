<p>EVENTUALLY, STUDIES will show that fracking is the cause of all these things and more. By then, the damage will be irreparable and blame will be a moot point. This is America, after all, where profit is king.</p>

<p>THANK YOU FOR SHEDding light on the dark side of the fracking boom. Those working in the industry can’t think about their future health or question the promises of fracking’s safety when without these jobs they can’t put food on the table.</p>

<p>I GREW UP IN GARfield County, Colorado, which Solotaroff mentions. I’ve always been struck by how people in oil country vote against their own interests; their inability to think long-term is painful. Why not elect officials who want to create green-energy jobs and training programs to benefit those now working the toxic oil and gas fields?</p>

<p>ONE OF THE MOST FRUStrating aspects of an important story like this one is the alleged lack of scientific consensus on what’s causing the stillbirths in Vernal. Which makes deniers able to push back like they do when the subject is climate science. It’s disheartening.</p>

    </div><p>THE BABIES OF VERNAL – those stillborn and dead soon after birth – are the canaries in the coal mine for the rest of the country, where new forms of filthy, unregulated energy extraction trump public heath. We can satisfy our appetite for cheap oil, so who cares if toxic chemicals are absorbed into the bloodstream of our youngest citizens?</p>
