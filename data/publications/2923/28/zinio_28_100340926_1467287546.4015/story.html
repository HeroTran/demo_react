    </div><p>About eight years ago, Jamaican singer Omar Pasley woke up with a melody in his head that he couldn’t shake. It was the beginning of “Cheerleader,” which has since become one of the more unlikely – and slowest-rising – Number One pop hits ever. “Cheerleader” started as a radio favorite in Jamaica in 2012, became a hit all over Europe in 2014, and finally topped the Hot 100 in mid-July. “Man,” says Pasley, “it’s overwhelming.”</p>
<p>Pasley, 28, grew up loving rappers like Tupac and Eminem, but things changed in his early twenties. “I got exposed to melodic aspects of music when I started listening to John Legend, Nat King Cole and Sam Cooke,” he says. His life changed forever when he met with Jamaican producer Clifton Dillon, who fell in love with the early version of “Cheerleader” and brought in drumming great Sly Dunbar to play on it. German producer Felix Jaehn later created a remix that has since taken over the world. Now, Omi hopes to have his debut album out by the fall. “The song is like being off to a good start in a race,” he says. “All I have to do is maintain my momentum and keep my composure.”</p>
