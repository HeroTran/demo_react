    </div><p><i>Feels Like,</i> the debut album from Nashville’s Bully, opens with a blast of pain. “I remember getting too fucked up,” singer-guitarist Alicia Bognanno yells at the top of her lungs over churning chords. “I remember showing up at your house/And I remember hurting you so bad/And I remember the way your sheets smelled.” For Bognanno – who also produced and engineered the album – capturing the song’s raw fury on record was no challenge. “_‘I Remember’ is a minute and 25 seconds of screaming,” she says. “I used ambient mics to make it feel a little bit like I felt inside.”</p>
<p>Bognanno, 25, learned how to get that <i>120 Minutes</i>-worthy sound from an alt-rock OG: In college, she interned at Electrical Audio, the Chicago studio founded by the Nirvana and Pixies producer Steve Albini. Working on her own music in off -hours, Bognanno developed her analog technique. “My head doesn’t work the same way Pro Tools does,” she says. “Once I started using a tape machine, it clicked.”</p>
<p>Late last year, she returned to Electrical Audio to record <i>Feels Like</i> with her three bandmates. While the album is out on an imprint of Columbia Records, Bognanno says signing with a major was about creative control more than selling LPs. “[The label was] 100 percent supportive of me engineering the record and doing what I wanted creatively,” she says. “That was a really big deal for us.”</p>
