    </div><p><b>G</b>ARY CLARK JR.’S 2012 MAJORlabel debut, <i>Blak and Blu</i>, was one of the most acclaimed blues albums in recent memory. Recording in Los Angeles with pop and rock producers Mike Elizondo (Dr. Dre, Fiona Apple) and Rob Cavallo (Green Day), the singerguitarist fused classic influences like Willie Dixon and Albert King with a love for Nirvana and hip-hop, yanking traditional American music into the present.</p>
<p>For his new album, <i>The Story of Sonny Boy Slim</i>, the 30-year-old Clark brought it all back home, recording in his native Austin in search of a more relaxed, familiar vibe. “I went in feeling vulnerable – I was very aware of the sophomore slump,” says Clark. “I really wanted to just come home and be in the studio, hang out and go back to my house.”</p>
<p>While <i>Blak and Blu</i> has a slick, L.A. feel, <i>Sonny Boy Slim</i> is pure Austin soul. Starting in March of last year, Clark headed into Austin’s Arlyn Studios with little more than ideas and grooves, self-producing the album with his live engineer Bharath “Cheex” Ramanath and Arlyn’s chief engineer, Jacob Sciba. “These guys,” says Clark, referring to Sciba and fellow engineer Joseph Holguin, “put in a lot of hard work to let me be in this room and let loose.”</p>
<p>Sessions would often take place late at night and sometimes continue past daybreak, fueled by beloved Arlyn coowner Lisa Fletcher’s combination of locally made vodka and fresh-squeezed grapefruit juice. Sciba grins and lifts a glass: “You want to know how we made this album?” he says. “This right here.” “I would come in the morning,” says Fletcher, “they would still be at it.”</p>
<p>The music that emerged ranges from the screaming “Grinder” (about a financially strapped family) to the stomping funk of the Princelike “Star” to the acoustic gospel “Church.” The album title, <i>The Story of Sonny Boy Slim,</i> seems to suggest a biographical element, but Clark says the album is driven more by a feeling than a concept: “The only real theme is, ‘Through all the bullshit, there’s always hope.’ That’s kinda it.”</p>
<p>Clark recently had a son, Zion, with his partner, fashion model Nicole Trunfio. Earlier this year, he debuted material from <i>The Story of Sonny Boy Slim</i> at Bonnaroo, and he’ll soon be hitting the road with his longtime touring band, which also played on the album. “I really just wanted to put everything together and be 1,000 percent who I am,” Clark says of the finished product. “This album is exactly what that is: loud.”</p>
