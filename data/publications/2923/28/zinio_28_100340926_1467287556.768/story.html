    </div><p><b>C</b>OLORADO-RAISED ECO-ACTIVIST and rapper Xiuhtezcatl Martinez is only 15 years old, but he’s already a leading voice in the environmental movement. In June, Martinez stunned representatives of nearly 200 countries when he delivered an impassioned climate-change address at the U.N., and he’ll soon appear in a short film being produced by Al Gore’s Climate Reality Project. Right now, he’s busy preparing his band, Earth Guardians (which also includes his 12-year-old brother, Itzcuauhtli), for a main-stage set at the politically charged Arise festival in Colorado this month. “We don’t just get recognition because we’re young,” Martinez says. “We get recognition because we bring a unique conscious hiphop to the stage that people aren’t seeing anywhere else.” Martinez enjoys the attention his music is getting. But he’s also young enough to know his entire generation is at risk if his message doesn’t make a difference. “This isn’t about the future,” he says. “The crisis is here.”</p>
