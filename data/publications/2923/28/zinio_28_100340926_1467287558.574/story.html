    </div><p>Last year, Australian poppunk band 5 Seconds of Summer released a chart-topping debut and opened for One Direction. They celebrated their success by getting right back into the studio: In January, they moved into a house in L.A. and brought in members of their favorite bands – Good Charlotte, Goldfinger and Sum 41 – to help write and produce an upcoming LP (tentatively due this year). Get ready for an all-out 5SOS blitz: They’re headlining amphit-heaters and arenas in America right now, and their label expects them to only get huger. “I think they absolutely have One Direction potential,” says Capitol Records’ Mitra Darab.</p>
