    </div><p><b> ‘</b>RETTY NICE, HUH?” QUAVO sweeps a hand around the matte-black interior of his BMW X6. The 24-year-old leader of the hyper-stylish rap trio Migos is doing 60 on a highway through midtown Atlanta. Takeoff, his three-years-younger nephew and partner in the group, leans back in the front passenger seat. “Put your seat belt on,” Quavo warns as he hits the accelerator.</p>
<p>Since they achieved fame with 2013’s ultracatchy “Versace” – a high-fashion flaunt whose distinctive rhyme patterns echoed through subsequent tracks from stars like Drake and Kanye – Migos have been on a hot streak. (The name is short for “amigos,” and they’ve hinted at links to drug-running slang.) Their boundless charisma and creative flair have made fans of street-level hustlers and Justin Bieber alike, and their 2014 hit “Fight Night” was recently certified gold. But big drama has been hanging over them as they finish their first studio LP, <i>Yung Rich Nation.</i> Tonight, the group’s third member – Quavo’s cousin Off set – is languishing 200 miles away in a Statesboro, Georgia, jail due to an April incident in which all three were busted on drug and weapons charges. It’s a major complication that couldn’t have come at a worse time. Even so, Quavo shrugs it off: “Everybody gets slapped on the wrist. Off set will be back soon.”</p>
<p>For now, the two free members of Migos have decided to go bowling. A little after 10 p.m., Quavo strolls into a brightly lit alley and rents a couple of lanes, paying the cashier with a bill from the fat roll of hundreds in the back pocket of his skinny gray Balmain jeans. A darkblue T-shirt from Migos’ clothing line, several flashy chains and medallions, a diamond-encrusted Rolex and a large pair of nonprescription Versace eyeglasses complete a look that could be compared to a swagged-out Steve Urkel. Quavo trades in his gray Air Jordans for bowling shoes, chooses a red ball and throws an effortless strike on his first try. “Put that in Rolling Stone!” he crows, kicking off a night in which he bowls with Lebowski-esque grace for two hours, scoring a solid 217.</p>

    </div><p>Later, back at Migos’ studio, Quavo and Takeoff sink into black leather couches and roll blunts. Quavo exhales a regal puff and jokingly banishes one of their crew from the room: “Get a gold plaque, then you can smoke in here.” But there’s an energy missing from the room without Off -set, who’s been locked up in Statesboro since the group’s April 18th performance. Police arrested all three members, along with about a dozen associates, after allegedly finding less than an ounce of marijuana, some codeine syrup and four handguns in their tour vans. While Quavo and Takeoff were each able to post $10,000 bail, Off set was forced to stay longer due to prior burglary and theft convictions on his rap sheet. The case made new headlines in early May, when Off set was hit with a battery charge after an alleged fight with another inmate. (He has pleaded not guilty.) “Off set’s the animal out the group,” Quavo says. “But he ain’t no bad guy.”</p>
<p>Migos’ lawyers maintain that the weapons were brought to Statesboro by the group’s security, and they question whether the police had any legal grounds to search the vehicles. “I think the entire arrest and the entire prosecution are strictly racially motivated,” says Quavo’s attorney, Cris Schneider. “Both law enforcement and the prosecutor know that they can’t tie any of that stuff to any of these individuals.”</p>
<p>Offset sounds fairly upbeat when he calls me from Statesboro a few days earlier. “I’m chilling,” he says. “I mean, I’m in jail, so there’s not much going on.” He tells me he’s been working out, writing lyrics and talking to his bandmates daily. “We pray together,” he says. “We’re family. We believe in loyalty.”</p>
<p>Around 2 a.m., Quavo steps into a vocal booth and begins spinning cocaine metaphors over a skeletal beat. “Marilyn Manson, Marilyn Manson,” he raps. “Know some niggas cooking up that Marilyn Manson.” He repeats the lines five or six times, building from a moody mumble to an excited yell. By 3 a.m., with a rough song sketched out, he’s twisting up another blunt in the control room. “Shit,” he says. “All we gotta do is keep making hits and let God judge.”</p>
