    </div><p><b>L</b>AST YEAR, TA-NEHISI COATES wrote “The Case for Reparations,” a painstakingly researched <i>Atlantic</i> cover story that confirmed him as one of the 21st century’s most important writers on race. For his new book, <i>Between the World and Me,</i> he shifted tactics, exploring the impact of racist violence in America through an extraordinary blend of memoir and history. “I wanted to think about the problem from a more literary perspective,” says Coates, 39. “I really wanted to make something beautiful.” The book is especially timely this summer: Its release was moved up from September to July after the killings in Charleston, South Carolina, in June.</p>
<p><i>James Baldwin is one of the clearest influences on your writing in this book. When did you first read his work?</i></p>
<p>I have this fond memory of college – my time was unrestricted. I remember sitting in a library at Howard University and reading <i>The Fire Next Time</i> in one session. It was such a pleasurable experience, to be lost in a work of art. And in this age, where the Internet is ubiquitous, it’s very hard to have that experience. I had this vision of some 19-year-old kid in a library somewhere, picking this book up and disappearing for a while. That was all I wanted.</p>
<p><i>One phrase that recurs throughout is “the Dream”: the idea that America needs to wake up from the false dream of race. How did you come to that theme?</i></p>
<p>It’s subverting the notion of the American Dream, subverting Martin Luther King’s rendition of “I have a dream.” I wanted to do something a little darker. It’s no different than these movies where they say it’s a darker version of some comicbook story. This is very much the same thing.</p>
<p><i>How much has hip-hop informed your writing?</i></p>
<p>It’s the biggest influence on my aesthetic. One of the constant questions I get is “Why are you so depressing? What about hope?” But hope is not very important in hip-hop. Hope has very little to do with Mobb Deep. That shaped me a lot.</p>
<p><i>Do you find something positive in exploring that darkness, even if it’s not hopeful?</i></p>
<p>There’s hope in there. But it’s not a bowl of sugar. It’s dark chocolate. It’s a little bitter. And that’s how it’s supposed to be. I think hope that’s not cut with some sense of struggle is false. I’m not a fucking politician! I don’t have to make people feel good at the end of the book.</p>
<p><i> “Forgiveness” is a word that’s been thrown around since Charleston. What do you think of that concept?</i></p>
<p>I think it would be good if the country was as forgiving of the folks who were upset down in Ferguson; if the country was as forgiving of the people who were upset down in Baltimore; if the country was as forgiving of the millions of people who find themselves incarcerated in this country because of some mistake they made when they were young. Forgiveness is not just for white supremacists. Forgiveness is not just for Dylann Roof.</p>
