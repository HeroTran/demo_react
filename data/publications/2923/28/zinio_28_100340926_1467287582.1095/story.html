    </div><p>A pivotal influence on hip-hop, EDM and synth-pop, not to mention David Bowie and Brian Eno, the mysterious Sixties and Seventies German music dubbed krautrock has mainly remained a hipster reference point in the U.S. British music writer David Stubbs may change that with <i>Future Days: Krautrock and the Birth of a Revolutionary New Music.</i> The hefty volume maps a freaky but fierce scene defined by radical beats and futuristic electronic soundscapes – a musical attempt at nothing less than a complete “re-establishment of cultural identity” after the horrors of World War II.</p>
<p>Among the book’s stars are Kraftwerk, the only band of the era to break through in the U.S. (inspiring hip-hop pioneer Afrika Bambaataa, among others), and Can, art-funk adventurers committed to collective improvisation (“No one was allowed to become Führer!” the band’s beat mastermind Jaki Liebezeit stresses).</p>

    </div><p>Stubbs was especially surprised to find that even in its homeland, krautrock remains a secret history. “It was remarkable to walk around Cologne with [Liebezeit] – no one recognizes him,” says the author. “They should erect a statue of the man.”</p>
