    </div><p><b>I</b>N THE SUMMER OF 2001, A LOW-budget summer-camp comedy called <i>Wet Hot American Summer</i> hit theaters. Despite featuring a spate of future stars – including Bradley Cooper, Amy Poehler, Elizabeth Banks and Paul Rudd – the movie grossed less than $300,000 and was torn to shreds by critics.</p>
<p>But just as it seemed like <i>Wet Hot American Summer</i> would be forgotten forever, young people everywhere fell in love with it. Midnight showings started popping up all over the country. “It became a thing where if you were on a date with somebody and they didn’t like <i>Wet Hot,</i> you know it’s not gonna go well,” says the film’s star and co-writer Michael Showalter. “It’s filled with anti-humor, where the joke is there is no joke.” Talk of a sequel began percolating, and Showalter and David Wain, the director and co-writer, approached Netflix about turning the film into a miniseries. “Netflix was emerging as a medium that wasn’t quite a TV series, but not quite a feature film,” says Wain. “It was the perfect wide canvas for us.”</p>

    </div><p>All of the original cast members returned for the eight-episode series (which premieres on Netflix on July 31st). This time, they were joined by newcomers Kristen Wiig, Michael Cera, “Weird Al” Yankovic, Lake Bell and Jason Schwartzman, as well as <i>Mad Men</i> vets Jon Hamm, John Slattery and Rich Sommer.</p>
<p>The original <i>Wet Hot</i> was shot at Camp Towanda in Honesdale, Pennsylvania; for the series, the camp was painstakingly re-created in Malibu. The film takes place on the last day of camp in 1981, but the show takes place entirely on the opening day that same summer. Many cast members are now in their forties, but most portray teenagers. “It adds a layer of comedy,” says Wain. “You’re only aware of it for the first couple of minutes of the show.”</p>
<p>The show manages to be even more ridiculous than the movie, with a complex plot involving an undercover government assassin, an Israeli soccer coach and the origin story of the talking vegetable can from the film. “When the dust settles, we’ll think about whether [we want to make another season],” says Wain. “Summer camp was a defining experience in my life, so I’m not surprised that there tend to be more places to go there.”</p>
