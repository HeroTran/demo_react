    </div><p><b>I</b>T’S BEEN SEVEN YEARS SINCE TOM Petty reassembled Mudcrutch, the short-lived band he formed in the early Seventies, years before finding fame with the Heartbreakers. Mudcrutch’s self-titled 2008 debut ranks among Petty’s best recent work. Now, he’s readying a second Mudcrutch set. “I’ve spent the last month frantically working on material,” Petty says, noting he has four songs that he’s happy with. “The good thing about Mudcrutch is that everyone brings in a song, so I don’t have to write 12 or something. Following up the last one is intimidating because I think that’s one of the better albums I was ever involved with.”</p>
<p>Mudcrutch originally featured drummer Randall Marsh and rhythm guitarist Tom Leadon (brother of founding Eagles guitarist Bernie Leadon) alongside two future Heartbreakers, guitarist Mike Campbell and keyboard player Benmont Tench. The band first got together in 1970 in Petty’s hometown of Gainesville, Florida, then moved to Los Angeles, where it broke up in 1975 after releasing just one single.</p>
<p>“It’s a totally different thing than the Heartbreakers,” says Petty. “It’s a different rhythm section and a different style of music. I play bass, which is a lot of fun for me, since I started out as a bass player. And Tommy is just out of sight on guitar. We spent our teenage years singing together, so we have a good blend.”</p>
<p>The first Mudcrutch album was recorded in only two weeks. The group plans a similar straight-ahead process when it reconvenes in a Los Angeles studio later this summer to hammer out new material. Mudcrutch played a handful of successful California club dates in 2008, but this time out Petty hopes they’ll tour more extensively.</p>
<p>“I’d love to get to the East Coast with it, too,” he says. “Last time, we were under the gun because we had a big Heartbreakers tour coming up. Right now, I’m just writing, and I need to change my mindset from the Heartbreakers to that kind of music.”</p>
<p>Petty thrilled fans two years ago when he played a series of theater shows in New York and Los Angeles packed with rarities and covers. “It changed my whole way of thinking about playing live,” he says. “I’d love to do more theater shows, but it’s complicated business-wise. I don’t know for sure, but I would bet it costs us money. But I loved the freedom of it.”</p>
<p>Also in the works is an album built around material Petty recorded for 1994’s <i>Wildflowers,</i> the Rick Rubin-produced solo disc that remains one of his most beloved LPs. “It’s not really a box set,” he says of the release. “We have the second album of the double album that was originally made. We’re going to put it out as its own album. It’s sitting there finished. I’m just waiting to hear when they’re gonna put it out.”</p>
<p>In the meantime, Petty has no intention of recording another solo album in the foreseeable future. “There’s nobody I’m longing to play with besides the Heartbreakers,” he says, “so I just don’t see the point of a solo record.”</p>
