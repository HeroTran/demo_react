    </div><p>British actress Bel Powley has appeared onscreen and onstage for a decade. But the 23-year-old’s role in the widely acclaimed film <i>The Diary of a Teenage Girl</i> involved a “scary” first – a series of sex scenes with co-star Alexander Skarsgård. “I’d never even had an onscreen kiss before,” she says, “let alone an onscreen shag. I was like, ‘This is the worst idea in the world!’_” By the time the film was finished, she’d shot eight of them – “including the lesbian sex scene.”</p>
<p>In <i>Diary,</i> Powley stars as Minnie, a 15-year-old in 1970s San Francisco who worships Iggy Pop, drops acid and just happens to be sleeping with her mom’s boyfriend. The film premiered at Sundance in January, earning a jury award and making Powley the It girl of the festival circuit.</p>
<p>At 13, she starred in <i>M.I. High</i>, a popular U.K. kids show, but she didn’t see herself pursuing an acting career. That changed at 16, when playwright Polly Stenham cast her in a play at London’s Royal Court Theatre. “It opened my eyes to all these strong women in this industry,” Powley says.</p>
<p>She was especially drawn to <i>Diary</i>’s matter-of-fact take on teenage sexuality. “There’s no moral story coming away from it,” says Powley, who has four more features in the works, including <i>Ashes in the Snow,</i> a World War II drama based on Ruta Sepetys’ bestselling novel. “There’s no life lesson to it. I desperately wanted to be part of that.”</p>
