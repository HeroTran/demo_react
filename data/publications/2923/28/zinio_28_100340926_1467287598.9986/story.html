    </div><p><b>‘</b>OST SECOND ALBUMS SUCK,” says Dan Harmon, lounging in a back room of a Burbank studio, across the table from Justin Roiland.</p>
<p>Roiland and Harmon are in the midst of creating not a second album but a second season. The show is Adult Swim’s <i>Rick and Morty</i>, an animated sci-fi sitcom that’s loosely based on <i>Back to the Future</i> and may be the best-written comedy on TV. In just 11 episodes, the show has become a ratings hit: All told, 9 million people watched Season One, and its fans include Matt Groening, who had Roiland and Harmon create a <i>Rick and Morty</i> couch gag for this season’s finale of <i>The Simpsons</i>.</p>
<p><i>Rick and Morty</i> chronicles the interdimensional adventures of an alcoholic, misanthropic scientific genius (Rick) and his bighearted, dimwitted, chronically nervous grandson (Morty). With the show finally resuming after a 15-month gap, its creators are a bit nervous. The first new episode, Harmon confesses, “went off the deep end conceptually. We’re pretty convinced it might be the worst episode.”</p>
<p>If that’s true, the pair have nothing to worry about. The episode begins with Rick freezing time for six months to clean up the house after a wild party. But due to an unforeseen complication, time keeps splitting into multiple simultaneous realities. The viewer’s screen splits into as many as 24 tiny frames, each with a slightly different version of the protagonists working to repair the rift.</p>
<p>Does this seem hard to follow? Welcome to the Michio Kaku world of <i>Rick and Morty</i>. “I consider it my job to service the insanity,” Harmon says, referring to Roiland, who voices Rick and Morty. “I love the idea of serving the crazy guy instead of being the crazy guy.”</p>
<p>Harmon has a reputation as a difficult genius. He’s one of the few people who can create a great show and then get fired from it, as he did from <i>Community</i> and <i>The Sarah Silverman Program</i>. “I forget my pain,” he says. “I just move from one thing to the next. If I remembered my pain, I’d stop working.”</p>
<p>Rick and Morty’s origins lie in a monthly short-film festival called Channel 101, which Harmon co-founded. It was there that Roiland debuted a “Doc and Mharti” short, which involved a mad scientist getting a young boy to lick his balls every time they encounter a problem.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, Roiland’s sensibility made it difficult to sell shows to network TV. He pitched network executives nonstop for 10 years, with little luck. So when Adult Swim asked Harmon to make a pilot, he decided to work on making Roiland’s humor palatable to a broader audience: “The challenge was, how do you make my mom understand how funny it is to see somebody vomiting diarrhea?” Harmon glances at his partner. “Not to pigeonhole Justin’s sensibility.”</p>
