    </div><p>In 1972, Leon Russell went into a Nashville studio to record <i>Hank Wilson’s Back</i>. Documentary filmmaker Les Blank chronicled the sessions for the album and spent two years at Russell’</p>
<p>lakeside compound in Oklahoma, taking a job at a place called Pappy Reeve’s Floating Motel and Fish Camp while there. But the resulting film, <i>A Poem Is a Naked Person,</i> was rarely screened due to tensions between Russell and Blank, who died in 2013. (“I might have killed him,” says Russell on why they didn’t speak for decades.)</p>
<p>Now, 43 years later, the movie is finally being released. With cameos from George Jones and Willie Nelson, and plenty of live footage of Russell, it’s a fascinating portrait of one of the Seventies’ great eccentrics. “He was a collector of the unusual,” Russell says of Blank. “Me being the prime unusual beast.”</p>
