    </div><h3><b>Difficult People</b></h3><p><b>Hulu</b></p>
<p>Before there was warm and fuzzy New York, there was rude and unbearable New York – the town <i>Difficult People</i> proudly calls home. Executive-produced by Amy Poehler, it’s the adventures of two BFFs doing what they can to make city life more miserable. Julie Klausner comes on like Larry David in Ann-Margret drag, while Billy Eichner earns a first-ballot spot in the Eyeroll Hall of Fame. When he’s asked why he doesn’t know how to use a power drill, he snaps, “My father is dead. And before that, he was Jewish.” He’s a waiter, she’s a TV recapper. They’re underemployed and underlaid – but never underfriended, because they have each other to complain to (and about). Their toxic chemistry is gaspfor-oxygen funny.</p>
