    </div><p><b>BY JON DOLAN</b></p>
<p>Wilco are one of the most respected bands on the planet – paragons of good taste, masters of genre-bridging craftsmanship and chill independence. Considering that heavy rep, it’s strange to think that when Jeff Tweedy put together Wilco’s first lineup 20 years ago, their loose bar-band vibe was a defiant response to the weighty myth he’d shouldered as a member of alt-country pioneers Uncle Tupelo. Wilco’s first album in four years recalls their early “hey, what the hell” freedom, in spirit if not in sound. It’s their most concise, catchy, naturally songful album in at least a decade – the sound of a band reconnecting with the fun of rocking out together in a room.</p>
<p>Wilco’s two most recent studio LPs – 2011’s <i>The Whole Love</i> and 2009’s <i>Wilco (The Album)</i> – were musically lavish, but also a touch staid, with their rough edges burnished to a too-smooth finish. Everything about <i>Star Wars</i> betrays ease and immediacy: They released it online for free with no warning. The jokey title references one of the most universally held pleasures in the history of human culture. The music is built on some pretty essential influences as well – from the <i>Abbey Road</i> majesty of “More . . .” and the rough-necked T. Rex shoogity-oogity of “Random Name Generator” to the basementglam punk attack of “Pickled Ginger” and the sad-ballad sweetness of “Magnetized.”</p>
<p>Wilco have gotten back in touch with their own strengths, too – especially the ability to match instantly familiar melodies with beautifully jarring noise, which made 2002’s <i>Yankee Hotel Foxtrot</i> and 1996’s <i>Being There</i> into watersheds. “The Joke Explained” is a cute folk-rock ditty made full-on awesome by peals of searing Sonic Youth-style drone poetry. And then there’s “You Satellite,” the incandescent jam that serves as the album’s elusive centerpiece. It’s a seething yet warm meditation on clinging to faint light in dark times, with what sounds like a battalion of guitars roiling against drummer Glenn Kotche’s avant-jazz tumble. Only Wilco could make something this eruptive feel so comfy, like a steel-wool security blanket.</p>
<p>The music’s urgent, live-inthe-studio feel pairs well with Tweedy’s lyrics, which seem more direct and compact than they have in a while. He’s working his usual themes – doubt, devotion, everyday fears and resigned hopes – without any of the literary obscurity that sometimes creeps into his writing. “I was only after a friend to follow through,” he sings on the lovely “Taste the Ceiling,” sounding like John Lennon in a moment of hard-fought grace. You can’t help wonder if <i>Sukierae,</i> the deeply personal side project he recorded last year with his teenage son Spencer on drums, might have helped revive Tweedy’s feel for music’s elemental joy.</p>
<p>In the album’s most carefree moments, of which there are many, he sounds at home in himself – never an easy move for one of rock’s top chroniclers of midlife man-malaise. “I belong to the stars in the sky,” he sings on “Random Name Generator,” making a blues boast out of spacey poesy and totally pulling it off . Give it up for the man. He’s got the Force by the spaceballs.</p>

<p>Likable 24-year-old folkie Fraser A. Gorman is the latest member of Courtney Barnett’s circle of Melbourne singer-songwriters. But where Barnett trades in self-aware grunge paranoia, Gorman is a classic-rock romantic who daydreams about ex-girlfriends and road trips. His tastes can run eclectic: These ballads and alt-country rockers find Gorman singing “It’s a strange old time to be in love with Elvis” in one song and paying tribute to Silver Jews in another. And while lines like “I’m a man/But lately you don’t seem to wonder who I am” show that Gorman has room to develop as a lyricist, <i>Slow Gum</i> is a promising beginning.</p>

<p>Nina Simone was a performer first and foremost; her recordings had to translate the drama and intensity of her live presence. This tribute set finds some of her clearest heirs – Lauryn Hill, Mary J. Blige, Common – reworking her standards with love, but the results veer sharply between transcendent and tepid. Hill brings power and grace to classics like “Feeling Good” and “Black Is the Color of My True Love’s Hair.” Singer-songwriter Alice Smith nearly steals the show with her bewitching “I Put a Spell on You.” But it’s Simone’s own voice on the album’s closing number, “I Wish I Knew How It Would Feel to Be Free,” that reminds us what, and who, we’re missing.</p>

<p>New Jersey rock &amp; roll believers Titus Andronicus get top mileage from a simple idea: baiting hardcore thrust with classic-rock hooks. On their fourth album, they bear down on a 90-minute rock opera in a <i>Quadrophenia</i> vein about growing up, freaking out and coming to unsettled terms. A shaggy chorale, a piano ballad, organ drones and Celtic touches – including a hurtling cover of the Pogues’ “A Pair of Brown Eyes” – provide variety. But the center remains frontman Patrick Stickles’ desperate howl, a mix of Johnny Rotten, Paul Westerberg and Conor Oberst that sounds fittingly trounced by the end. Long may he wail.</p>

Though Grohl (who played bass and lent his 606 Studios to the cause) and cohorts are far from their teenage years, <i>Greatest Hits Vol. 1</i> rarely sounds like old guys trying to relive their pissed-off youth.

<p>In his main gig as Real Estate’s guitarist, Matthew Mondanile helps provide the warm melodic hooks that drive the band’s suburban bliss. Mondanile’s side project, Ducktails, has typically off ered him space to explore more abstract guitar moods, but his latest album refines that sprawl with more concise songwriting. A prime example is “Surreal Exposure,” whose twangy guitar and lovesick tone could easily have found a home on one of Real Estate’s breakthrough LPs. Even so, Mondanile doesn’t simply reproduce the dynamic of his main band: A pair of drowsy instrumentals and three songs featuring vocals from arty composer Julia Holter add to a pleasantly diff use vibe that’s all his own.</p>

His latest, released online sans fanfare, pairs tracks called “Morning” and “Evening” – each the length of an LP side – inspired by his late grandfather’s collection of Hindi film soundtracks. Both sample Indian national heroine Lata Mangeshkar, the voice of hundreds of Bollywood musicals, now fluttering amid dancing synth melodies over pillowy bass tones and plush orchestral beds. Club beats pound on “Morning,” then dissolve; “Evening” flips and reverses the arc – an invitation to click “repeat” and play it all day.</p>

<p>The first proper studio album from high-octane Atlanta trio Migos isn’t all that different from the piles of acclaimed free mixtapes they’ve released. On all but a few tracks, <i>Yung Rich Nation</i> sticks to their addictive formula of raps that tumble out in polyrhythmic triplets and adlibs that punctuate like paintballs, all soaked in a giddy <i>joie de vivre.</i> The biggest distinction is lyrical: Tales of slinging drugs are starting to fade in favor of boasts that remind you of their rising fame (“Recognition”). And while there’s nothing here remotely as unstoppable as 2013’s “Versace,” highlights like “What a Feeling” show off enough fresh flows to make this a victory party worth joining.</p>

<p>While Strokes frontman Julian Casablancas pursues his artier impulses, guitarist Albert Hammond Jr. packs his third solo disc with the band’s signature crisp melodies, curt guitar churn and New Wave synth ripple. As a singerlyricist, though, Hammond has an openhearted, quizzical mien that’s a far cry from the Strokes’ pokerfaced chic. The tunes could at times be tighter, but his charm sells them, especially on “Born Slippy,” which cops a title from Nineties EDM gods Underworld for a cute meditation on the passage of time. He’s a Stroke for all seasons.</p>

<p>Guitarist Buddy Guy – one of the last working giants from the electric blues’ greatest generation – traces his life in mission and missing, from the crackling title cut to the B.B. King memorial “Flesh and Blood,” sung with Van Morrison, and “Come Back Muddy,” a message to Guy’s late boss, Muddy Waters. Guy cowrote just four songs here, but he sings and solos with reliable ferocity; two tracks with harpist Kim Wilson evoke his classic partnership with Junior Wells. “I was born to play the guitar/People, I got blues running through my veins,” Guy sings – lines he didn’t write but lived. In the blues, that’s what matters.</p>

<p>Meek Mill is one of hiphop’s most powerful brag machines, hollering bluntforce boasts with desperate energy and uncut brio. His second major-label LP continues to show off his flair for internal wordplay (“Mommy was a booster, Daddy was a shooter/So they couldn’t blame me when I went and copped the Ruger/Looking at my homey, see the ghost of Freddy Krueger”). But his best moments are scary in a diff erent way: “In my city, we talk heavy and die young,” he raps on “The Trillest.” It’s a message that booms out louder than life.</p>

<p>Instrumental duo Ratatat are indie studio geeks with superproducer chops, just as comfortable reimagining Biggie Smalls joints (see 2006’s hip-hop-themed <i>Remixes Vol. 2</i>) as they are cranking out grooves that suggest a dreamier Daft Punk. Their first album in five years goes heavy on space-age synths, elegiac guitar cheese and chunky disco beats. There are also a couple of lovely slow tunes that deploy steel guitar, a new addition to their trick bag (“Supreme”). But as with every Ratatat record, <i>Magnifiqu</i>e leaves you wondering what they could do if they fleshed these out into actual songs with real singers.</p>

All the psychedelic cool in the world can’t hide his ire: “America, open up your doors/Is it right to always fight against the other?” he pleads on “Puzzles.”<i>Multi-Love</i> is a vibrant vision of connection.</p>

<p>When Flo Morr issey rhapsodizes about “singing through the sky,” it’s easy to imagine her floating through the clouds with a golden lyre. Joanna Newsom producer Noah Georgeson provides the enchanted-forest backdrops for the 20-year-old Brit’s ethereal voice; you’ll get lost in the lush romanticism of “Why,” and the terrifically titled “I Only Like His Hat, Not Him” oozes woozy charm. At times, her melancholy lilt evokes that <i>other</i> Morrissey, but when she sings, “Please don’t think I’m sad/Happiness is my friend in the end,” heaven knows Flo isn’t miserable now.</p>
