    </div><p>TOM CRUISE HIT ON A TANGY idea when he decided to turn the old-school CBS series <i>Mission: Impossible</i> (1966-1973) into a film franchise. As producer as well as star, Cruise puts a new director in charge of every movie. So far at the helm, since 1996, we’ve had Brian De Palma, John Woo, J.J. Abrams and Brad Bird (his <i>Ghost Protocol</i> is my fave and the biggest box-office hit in the bunch). Cruise, 53, will presumably play IMF (Impossible Mission Force) undercover agent Ethan Hunt until he’s eligible for AARP. Fine by me. Back in a galaxy far, far away (1986’s <i>Top Gun)</i>, Cruise had a killer line: “I feel the need, the need for speed.” He’s still feeling it. This dude can run, jump, climb, ride and fight like a muthafucker, often shirtless.</p>
<p>Cruise is back in action for the fifth time, and no worse for wear, in <i>Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation</i>. The director is Christopher McQuarrie, who cooked up something moody and intense with Cruise in 2012’s <i>Jack Reacher.</i> But Mc-Quarrie has never worked on this huge a scale, and the strain to go big and bigger sometimes shows. The movie begins with Ethan hanging from the side of an Airbus A400M cargo plane during takeoff. Why? That kind of question is irrelevant in a franchise in which action trumps logic at every turn.</p>
<p>And yet, McQuarrie – an Oscar winner for his script for 1995’s <i>The Usual Suspects</i> – has an ace to play. That’s the indie sensibility he brings to the usual Hollywood FX. Don’t get me wrong. <i>Rogue Nation</i> doesn’t skimp on the wow factor, especially a Moroccan motorcycle chase and an underwater sequence that has Ethan whooshing around like a sock during spin cycle. And the laughs kick in whenever Ethan gets help from his miracle-working teammates Benji (Simon Pegg, priceless) and Luther (Ving Rhames). The plot, such as it is, involves Ethan and Agent Brandt (Jeremy Renner) trying to save the IMF from extinction by the CIA, led by an exposition-spouting Alec Baldwin. No one believes Ethan that a mysterious Syndicate is hellbent on seizing global control.</p>
<p>McQuarrie borrows elements of mythical evil from <i>Suspects</i> when Ethan and the double-dealing British agent Ilsa Faust (a ready-to-rock Rebecca Ferguson) lock horns with mega-creepy Solomon Lane (Sean Harris), a villain cut from the same cloth as Keyser Söze. Harris, best known for <i>The Borgias,</i> can’t compete with Kevin Spacey’s iconic Söze. Neither can <i>Rogue Nation,</i> which succeeds best when McQuarrie channels his inner film geek and stages a spectacular shootout at the Vienna opera house that evokes Hitchcock’s <i>The Man Who Knew Too Much.</i> This knockout sequence, in which Cruise fires up everything he has as actor and athlete, shows that <i>Mission: Impossible</i> still has gas in its tank even when its engine sputters.</p>
<h3><b>Southpaw</b></h3><p><i>Jake Gyllenhaal</i></p>
<p>Directed by Antoine Fuqua</p>

    </div><p>JAKE GYLLENHAAL IS ON A roll. Onscreen in <i>Nightcrawler, Enemy</i> and <i>Prisoners,</i> and onstage in <i>Constellations, Little Shop of Horrors</i> and <i>If There Is I Haven’t Found It Yet,</i> he shows the kind of versatility and commitment that should have won him prizes. The awards didn’t materialize, but it’s just a matter of time. Maybe it’ll be for <i>Southpaw,</i> a retro, in-yourface fight drama that dribbles into sappiness. Much, though far from all, is redeemed by Gyllenhaal’s virtuoso performance. The actor, 34, trained for four months and gained 15 pounds of muscle to play light-heavyweight champ Billy Hope. But the externals – scars, tattoos and slurred voice – don’t begin to suggest the emotional depths Gyllenhaal brings to the part of a bruiser on the ropes.</p>
<p>Billy is at the top of his game, but constant jabs have left him punchy. His wife, Maureen (Rachel McAdams), wants him to slow down and enjoy their 11-year-old daughter, Leila (a feisty Oona Laurence). Maureen is way more than lacquered hair, nails and spray tan. She and Billy were raised in Hell’s Kitchen orphanages. McAdams, strong and smoldering, is explosively good. Spoiler alert: Her role is shortened when Maureen is involved in a shooting accident sparked by Miguel Escobar (Miguel Gomez), a fighter who thinks he can goad Billy into taking him on for high stakes.</p>
<p>Director Antoine Fuqua (<i>Training Day, The Equalizer</i>), working from an overcooked screenplay by Kurt Sutter (<i>Sons of Anarchy</i>), knows he’s not in the same ring with <i>Raging Bull, Rocky, Million Dollar Baby</i> and <i>The Fighter</i>, though the script unblushingly mooches from each of them. Still, Fuqua shuffles the tools of the genre with genuine flair. As tragedy lands Billy in the pits of desperation, poverty and child-custody battles, Fuqua shifts focus from Billy’s crooked agent (Curtis “50 Cent” Jackson) to a trainersavior, Tick Wills (the expert Forest Whitaker), who teaches Billy a new fighting style that doesn’t involve stopping punches with his head. The powerful boxing scenes, vividly shot from Madison Square Garden to Vegas by Mauro Fiore and edited by John Refoua, help distract from the father-daughter scenes that outdo <i>The Champ</i> (the Wallace Beery original and the Jon Voight remake) for gooey sentiment. Amazingly, Gyllenhaal never cheats on his character’s sense of dignity. Against the odds, he keeps you in Billy’s corner. That’s a champ.</p>

    </div><p>MAYBE NATIONAL L AMpoon’s <i>Vacation</i> comedies, begun in 1983, hit your sweet spot. Maybe it’ll hit again with this next-generation reboot from writer-directors Jonathan Goldstein and John Francis Daley. With Ed Helms as Rusty Griswold – son of Clark (Chevy Chase) and Ellen (Beverly D’Angelo) – taking his wife, Debbie (Christina Applegate), and sons, James (Skyler Gisondo) and Kevin (Steele Stebbins), down holiday road, there must be raucous R-rated fun. You’d think, but the gags about pedophiles and eating shit smack of desperation. Leslie Mann and wild-card Chris Hemsworth, as her cock-flashing hubby, get the heartiest hoots. The rest is comic history warmed over.</p>

    </div><p>WHERE’S THE DRAMA AND, hell, the laughs in the nonspectacle of two writers talking with and at each other? For a riveting answer, check out <i>The End of the Tour.</i> The film is based on the 2010 book <i>Although of Course You End Up Becoming Yourself,</i> by Rolling Stone writer David Lipsky. Over five days in 1996, Lipsky (Jesse Eisenberg) interviewed celebrated novelist and essayist David Foster Wallace (Jason Segel, like you’ve never seen him before). It was the end of Wallace’s tour for his magnum opus, <i>Infinite Jest</i>. It wasn’t until after the depression-plagued Wallace hanged himself in 2008 that Lipsky used the material in a story that won a National Magazine Award and became the basis for his book. Suicide hangs over the movie as it did the book, scrambling our thoughts and perhaps helping us achieve a greater understanding.</p>
<p>Nothing and everything happen in the movie. Director James Ponsoldt (<i>The Spectacular Now</i>), working from a fluid script by playwright Donald Margulies, does justice to the book without compromising his film. This is no biopic. The story takes place when the bandanna-wearing Wallace was at the peak of his success and trying in his own shambling, humane way to deal with it.</p>
<p>From the moment Lipsky, played with seductive intelligence and a secret smile by Eisenberg, arrives at Wallace’s bachelor cave in snowbound Bloomington, Illinois, the scene is set for mesmerizing mind games. The more Lipsky pushes – his editor (Ron Livingston) wants details of the author’s alleged heroin addiction – the warier Wallace becomes.</p>
<p>So we watch as Lipsky and Wallace travel by car, bus and jet trying to suss each other out, to touch a nerve, to form a bond. In Minneapolis, they eat junk food and argue pop culture. Then, at dinner with Wallace’s pal Julie (Mamie Gummer) and his former college love Betsy (Mickey Sumner), the low-key author accuses Lipsky of crass flirting. His words sting. Segel, giving the performance of his career, potently catches Wallace’s internal conflicts.</p>
<p>As the details accumulate, so does the power of the film, an illuminating meditation on art and life that hits you hard with its ferocity and feeling. What could have been a static record of a conversation becomes kinetic cinema of startling immediacy. Lipsky wrote, “Books are a social substitute; you read people who, at one level, you’d like to hang out with.”<i>The End of the Tour</i> lets us hang out with two diff erent writers who strive rigorously to never completely let their guard down. Although of course they end up becoming themselves. Right in front of us. That’s what makes the movie, elevated by two extraordinary actors, an exhilarating gift. In the last image Ponsoldt gives us of Wallace, the former athlete is doing something that distills what his words do with such artful abandon: dancing.</p>
