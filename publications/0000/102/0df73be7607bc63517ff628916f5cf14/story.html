<h2>INTRO TO IP</h2><p>Intellectual property (IP) is all about us: from brand names to marketing to customer goodwill. To say companies don’t pay attention to intellectual property is an understatement. IP can be worth up to 80% of corporate value – perhaps more. Research from innovation charity Nesta and the Work Foundation claims company investment in intangibles now exceeds that of tangible assets.</p>
<p>Yet in 2014, accounting rules still prohibit brand names being named as a value in corporate filings.</p>
<p>But this antediluvian attitude to IP is starting to change, as are financing options for IP. So does that mean it’s time for a fresh look, then?</p>
<p>One issue with any discussion around intellectual property is that it doesn’t come with a homogenous set of rights – and not all rights are equal. Some IP can be so far ahead of its time it can be almost worthless.</p>
<p>“My favourite example,” says Lorna Brazell, IP expert at law firm Osborne Clarke, “is the zip. It was invented in the 1920s and quickly became universal after the Second World War, but the patent rights had expired. Nobody benefited. That’s a tragedy. So you can be ahead of your time, but it’s about what is being used, or applied, in the market today or tomorrow.”</p>
<p>In essence, IP consists of a number of rights relevant to a number of industries. Each of those categories of rights has a different legal impact and so is different for each valuation. That’s the tricky subjectivity out of the way (for the moment).</p>
<p>However, for many businesses – especially start-ups – IP is often all you have, points out Matthew Jones, partner at EIP Legal. “When you’re first starting up a company, what you don’t have is plant, machinery, a product – even money,” he explains. “But you do have a concept or a notion or a design or plan. That’s all about IP. So the entire value of the company, when it’s very young, is bound up in IP.”</p>
<p>The downturn in the global economy between 2007 and 2012 saw insolvency practitioners take an increasingly close interest in IP, with many distressed businesses seeing intangible assets being sold off, often in haste. Now, as the global economy recovers, IP remains equally relevant.</p>
<p>“A lot of people think that intellectual property is about new industry, or the new economy,” comments Kelvin King, co-author of a coalition report, Banking on IP. “But it’s not. It’s fundamentally not. It’s also old economy – hotels with brand names, manufacturing and engineering with patents. It’s media, music and film copyright.”</p>
<p>It’s also about education and awareness; in other words, it’s still exceptionally misunderstood.</p>
<p>One IP research report interviewed 500 SMEs and discovered that 84% valued their IP at… zero. Intellectual property, be aware, is not just designs or logos, but also about goodwill, domain names, trademarks, copyrights, confidential information and databases.</p>
<h2>HOW DO I VALUE IP?</h2><p>There’s a rash of accountancy-approved ways of working out the value of intellectual property over the years. But the underlying principal is that such formulas are only as good as the data you put in (if you put garbage in, you get garbage out).</p>
<p>“The one broad rule is tax,” warns Osborne Clarke’s Brazell. “If you estimate the value of your patent portfolio at £10m and you try to change it in future, then your transfer tax liability will be different.</p>
<p>“But if you don’t make an estimate today, then the taxman may make his own calculation.”</p>
<p>Of course, valuations become more of an issue when selling. And while IP valuation is a long way from selling a house, there remain similarities says Isabel Napper, partner and head of technology at law firm Mills &amp; Reeve in Cambridge.</p>
<p>“The situation is like wanting to look at the value of your property on Zoopla. You’re looking at neighbouring houses, how long they took to sell and what price was achieved. It’s [IP] very much done on the same basis. Specialists will retain databases of what past deals were done.</p>

<p>“You might, for example, have a specialist database on medicinal products rather than engineering components,” explains Napper.</p>
<p>So far, so good. But if the IP is more disruptive than existing technology, then it’s more of a challenge. And this is where the British housing market analogy keels promptly over – for a bit. “Some clients,” says Napper, “do have really exciting new ideas that seem to be game-changing, but they haven’t thought through the commercial application of it. And that is the downfall of a lot of IP ideas. It’s all very well coming up with an iPad,” she goes on. “But what was clever about the iPad was all the apps you could use with it.”</p>
<p>David Clark, partner at patent and trademark attorneys Appleyard Lees, says that if you’re buying IP, you need to establish early on who you’re acquiring it from – understand very clearly the chain of ownership. Are you sure they own the copyright so you can acquire it?</p>
<p>“Another risk is that all these IP rights are negative rights; they are the right to stop other people doing something they would otherwise be free to do,” he says. “You have to look beyond the exclusions/restrictions you can place on others to think about what earlier broader restrictions that may be relevant. Buying rights in is not a shortcut to freedom to operate. There may be broader rights outstanding in the areas you want to operate in.”</p>
<p>Fundamentally, established methodologies for valuing IP exist and, equally importantly, are accepted by courts and tax authorities. That also means banks, finally, are starting to get a firmer grasp of IP too.</p>
<h2>THE BEST WAYS TO EXPLOIT IP</h2><p>Be aware that a lot of IP created is, by nature, speculative. That means there may well be value in it for someone, somewhere. “Someone may well treat their tech rights as a single indivisible thing,” says Brazell. “You might have a patent on a coating for saucepans. But that coating might be very useful for an application for industrial reactors.” So lateral thinking is encouraged.</p>
<p>
There’s a rash of options to exploit IP, from protecting products and services to blocking others from entering the market says Nicola McNeely, partner at Capital Law. <br /> “IP rights help businesses establish and develop reputations and goodwill. That can be invaluable for businesses looking to expand or set up in new territories as a good reputation elsewhere can help to drum up trade early on,” she says.</p>
<p>An IP rights framework can also help businesses to licence their IP to third parties in return for commission or royalties, providing useful revenue streams in situations where the IP owner can’t, perhaps, deploy the IP themselves.</p>
<p>Meanwhile funding gaps for many companies can be considerable. Take the example of Splash Damage/Fireteam, an independently-owned games developer which creates high-end, multi-user online games. It recently brought two sought-after software tools to market, Echo and X-ray, which analyse player behaviour while games are being played. This distinctive IP was, therefore, highly valuable. Using Lombard Technology Services’ Software Licence Solution (SLS), this provided a route to free up capital without hitting the operation of software licenses.</p>
<p>The upshot? By deploying the SLS, Splash Damage/Fireteam took capital previously tied up in pricey licence fees and development costs. “As a direct result,” Ian McVicar, managing director of Lombard Technology Services says, “The company has secured new leads, engaged with other major players and plans to accelerate development of new games.”</p>

<p>For co-founder Richard Jolly, the move means the company hangs onto full use of its IP and can fund further development. “It effectively means we are a good few years ahead of our competition,” he says.</p>
<p>Adam Tavener, chairman of Clifton Asset Management, has much experience in exploiting IP. He says the crowd funding movement – such as Crowdcube and Seeders – has also moved the game on. Effectively this is where investors evaluate the potential of the business, “which is absolutely rooted in IP”. More staid arrangements remain – for example the franchise model, exported nationally and internationally. However, Tavener points to the rise in pension-led funding, an option increasingly relevant where there is no issue of change of control. This is where a SIPP, for example, can buy up IP from a company, leasing it back with payments made from the pension (some limits exist – up to around 70% of a pension’s value).</p>
<p>So in conclusion, yes, there are risks, but ultimately it’s funding for directors by directors. And bear in mind that the combined pension pot of the UK is thought to be worth around £2trn.</p>
