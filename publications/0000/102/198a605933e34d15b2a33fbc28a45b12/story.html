<p class="dropcap">Bruce Lawson’s life has certainly never been dull. “I suppose you’d call me a maverick,” he says. “Not an eccentric, but I’m not really a team player – more someone who takes their own chances. I like that.”</p>
<p>This, after all, is a man who has launched a major radio station, played rugby for Jamaica, walked through the Channel Tunnel, been national treasurer of Ukip and has just written his first book – and all this after becoming an accountant at 16, because his dad promised him a Lambretta if he did.</p>
<p>“He said if I went into accountancy he’d get me a scooter,” says Lawson. “It was great, it cost £50 and lasted an hour-and-a-half before I crashed it into a tree, so I went to work on the bus.”</p>
<p>There is at least some convention to his career. He began at his uncle’s firm before joining McLintocks, (now KPMG). Then he enjoyed four years in the Caribbean working for Price Waterhouse (now PwC) and, incongruously, playing in four international rugby fixtures. He later joined Coopers &amp; Lybrand in Cork before buying half a practice in Kidderminster. He remained self-employed for the next 37 years, ending with a spell as consultant to Shropshire farming specialists Hudson LM.</p>
<p>But Lawson’s extra-curricular activities have given him as much satisfaction. “Some accountants stay at the same office forever. That’s great, but it’s not me. I like to look for opportunities.” Hence his fundraising of £500,000 to launch Radio Wyvern in 1982, and his oversight of Ukip’s finances. “After Nigel Farage took over as leader I became treasurer. I could have been an MEP but I don’t care for all the political machinations, whichever party it is. Every political career ends in tears eventually.”</p>
<p>But Lawson quickly found a replacement career – as a writer. “In 2009 I read Andrew Marr’s The Making of Modern Britain, which featured a section on Charles Rolls – one half of Rolls-Royce. I thought he was fascinating and found out more, and it seemed logical to write it all down, in a ripping good yarn.”</p>
<p>The result is the biography, Charles Rolls of Rolls-Royce. “Rolls was the Richard Branson of the Edwardian age,” says Lawson. “He was a brilliant man, full of ideas. He was an adventurer – he won the second ever TT race on the Isle of Man, made 177 balloon flights and he was the first Briton to die flying his own plane. But he was also strange and parsimonious – he’d arrive at a hotel with nothing but a pair of clean socks in his top pocket. I did not have the first clue about cars, but Rolls intrigued me.”</p>
<p>Passion for the man resulted in Lawson acquiring one of  Rolls’ creations – eventually – that he now drives on the roads surrounding his home town of Montgomery, Powys. “I started going to Rolls-Royce Enthusiasts’ Club events, but realised I couldn’t turn up in my Vauxhall estate. So I now drive an Ocean Blue 1986 Rolls Royce – christened Lady J.</p>
<p>“Primarily all of this is possible because of my accounting career. I could have ended up a journalist, or an alcoholic, or both, but I became an accountant. Some people think accountancy is about numbers. It isn’t, it’s about people – and I’ve had a lot of fun.”</p>
