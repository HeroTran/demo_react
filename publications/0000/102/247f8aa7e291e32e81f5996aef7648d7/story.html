<p class="dropcap">With the dust still settling on the “political earthquake” of the European elections, it’s not surprising that senior politicians across Europe have been squabbling hard over who will become the next European Commission president.</p>
<p>Only a small proportion of voters took part in the elections and an even smaller number seemed to know they were also voting for the next president. Did anyone in the UK know that?</p>
<p>In mainland Europe there were televised debates between the candidates. It says a lot about how tuned out UK voters are from the bureaucracy of the EU that the only TV debates this side of the Channel were the “in/out” ding-dongs between Nigel Farage and Nick Clegg. </p>
<p>The arguments (rational and emotional) will continue to rage over our place in Europe, but there is little that any talking suit from Brussels or Westminster can say that excites UK voters.</p>
<p>When it comes to the EU, it seems apathy rules in the UK, or it would if only anyone could be bothered.</p>
