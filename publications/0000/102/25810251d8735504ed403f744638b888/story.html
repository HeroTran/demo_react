<p class="dropcap">Politicians are a hyperbolic lot. And I admit it: journalists aren’t much better. So when Nigel Farage delivered his promised “political earthquake” at the European and local elections, the headline writers eagerly lapped up his purple prose. Which begs the question: what on earth will we all say and write if Scotland votes to quit the UK?</p>
<p>So with only a few months to go until the seismic vote on the country’s future, FactCheck has been poring over the rival claims of the Yes and No camps. The most glaring contradiction is the Treasury’s boast that Scots will benefit to the tune of £1,400 a year if they stay in the Union – versus the Scottish Nationalist government’s talk of an annual independence “bonus” of £1,000.</p>
<p>First, some agreed facts. Public spending per head is about 10% higher in Scotland than the UK average. But tax revenue from oil and gas in Scottish waters more than makes up for that. Giving Scotland a geographical share of oil revenues, the country’s paid in a bit more than it’s taken out in recent years.</p>
<h2 class="noindent">SALMOND'S FAIR POINT</h2><p class="noindent">So when Scotland’s first minister Alex Salmond moans that Scots “are getting a raw deal under the current arrangement – paying more into Westminster than we get out”, he has a point.</p>
<p>But a newly independent Scotland would still start with a net fiscal deficit. It might, however, be smaller as a percentage of GDP than the UK deficit, as it has been in four out of the last five years.</p>
<p>The Scottish government thinks this will remain the case in a newly independent country. The Treasury disagrees. And here’s why: Salmond uses a much more optimistic projection of future oil earnings than the Treasury does.</p>
<p>The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) sides with the Treasury, drawing on evidence from the Office for Budget Responsibility. As the IFS, in its usual sober way, puts it: “Whilst it may turn out to be the case that the Scottish economy does a great deal better after independence than it would as part of the UK, planning on this as a central assumption seems less than cautious.” So if the Scottish tectonic plates have yet to shift, what of the earthquake that’s already happened?</p>
<p>Nigel Farage’s extraordinary victory was one in the eye for the mainstream political parties, Europe – and those much-maligned Romanians. The UKIP leader built his campaign around popular concerns about mass migration. Labour and the liberal media recoiled in horror when Farage said he’d feel uncomfortable living next door to a family of Romanians. But the voters (or at least those who bothered to turn out) took him to their hearts.</p>
<h2 class="noindent">ALLEGATIONS REPEATED</h2><p class="noindent">While he apologised for what he’d said about his putative neighbours, he went on to repeat allegations about the crimes supposedly committed by Romanians. Was he right?</p>
<p>First up: “92 per cent of all ATM crime in London is committed by Romanians.” It’s quite a figure, and it’s one that was first attributed to detective chief inspector Paul Barnard, then head of the Met’s Dedicated Cheque and Plastic Crime Unit. He made the claim in an ITV documentary in 2012. We’ve since been back to Scotland Yard and asked them for the data to support it. None was forthcoming, but they assured us it was “based on police intelligence”.</p>
<p>Next: “28,000 Romanians were arrested in the last five years in the Metropolitan Police area alone.” The number is accurate, and comes from a Met Police Freedom of Information release. However, Farage has misquoted it – 28,000 is the number of arrests, not the number of crimes committed.</p>
<p>Still, it’s a sizeable figure. Only the Poles have a higher number of arrests and there are many more Poles in London than there are Romanians.</p>
<p>Finally: “7% of all crime across the 28 EU member states was caused by 240 gangs.” This comes from a Times article, which quoted Europol director Rob Wainright. But again Farage has got it slightly skewed. The figure actually refers to the number of criminals, not the number of crimes.</p>
<p>Earthquake or not – and the Tories, Labour and the Liberal Democrats will tell you they have their doubts – it was based on some decidedly shaky factual foundations.</p>
