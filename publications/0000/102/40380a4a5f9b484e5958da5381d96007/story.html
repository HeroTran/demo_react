<h2>“UNJUSTIFIABLE&quot; COMPLAINT NO EXCUSE FOR BREACH</h2><p>An ICAEW member who failed to respond to an investigation committee letter about a complaint against him because he thought it would be proved unjustified has lost his appeal against sanctions imposed by a disciplinary committee tribunal (DCT).</p>
<p>Richard Leach found out to his cost that it is a breach of disciplinary byelaw 13 not to provide information and documents when requested by the ICAEW’s investigation committee – and within 14 days. He did not turn up to the DCT hearing and, in his absence, the tribunal found the charge proved. He was severely reprimanded, fined £3,500 and ordered to pay costs assessed at £1,275.</p>
<p>Leach appealed. He argued that the tribunal had been wrong to refuse his written application for an adjournment on the grounds of ill health, and that the complaint to which the investigation committee letter referred would ultimately have proved to be unjustified.</p>
<p>Before the DCT hearing, he emailed to ask for an adjournment and sent a copy of a letter from his consultant cardiologist to his doctor, reporting his ill health. However, the letter did not suggest that his medical condition made him unfit to attend a disciplinary hearing, nor did he produce any further medical evidence. The hearing went ahead.</p>
<p>
The appeal committee panel consulted Hamer’s Professional Conduct Casebook, which includes decisions by judges when reviewing refusals by disciplinary tribunals to grant adjournments on medical grounds. In Awan v The Law Society, the then Master of the Rolls, Lord Phillips, wrote: “If medical reasons are advanced, the tribunal may well require production of a medical report or certificate in support of the application. If a report or certificate is produced, <br /> the tribunal is entitled to consider whether it sufficiently supports the reason of the adjournment that is relied upon. It is not obliged… to grant the application to adjourn simply because a medical certificate is produced, whatever its content.”</p>
<p>As for Leach’s second grounds for appeal – that the complaint against him would have been dismissed in due course – the panel said: “It was for the investigation committee to decide whether the complaint was well-founded, not for the appellant to try to pre-empt that decision by refusing to co-operate.”</p>
<h2>KINGSTON SMITH FALLS FOUL OF CMRS</h2><p>Top 20 firm Kingston Smith has been fined £5,000 and severely reprimanded by ICAEW over breaches of the Clients’ Money Regulations (CMRs).</p>
<p>Under a consent order agreed with the institute’s investigation committee, the City-based firm admitted it had made withdrawals from the firm’s client money bank accounts on behalf of five clients. This was contrary to regulations 20(h) and 22 because it had failed to obtain written authority to make the payments or agreement to the fees.</p>
<p>The firm had also failed to comply with regulation 13 of the CMRs as it held funds in excess of £10,000 for three clients for more than 30 days and did not pay them into client bank accounts designated by the clients’ name or a number or letters allocated to those accounts.</p>
<h2>“UNWARRANTED SLUR&quot; WINS APPEAL</h2><p>An ICAEW member has won part of his appeal against severe disciplinary sanctions because he was not given the chance to defend himself at a tribunal hearing against what he described as an “unwarranted slur”.</p>
<p>Tim Anderson had been charged with carrying out three audits for a client in breach of audit regulation 3.02. He had failed to arrange for external hot file reviews under Ethical Standard 4, which requires them when the audit fees of one client are likely to exceed 10% of the firm’s fee income.</p>
<p>He had also provided incorrect information in the firm’s 2010 and 2011 practice assurance returns: he had stated that his firm had retained a record of the audit compliance review showing the work done and results, when in fact only informal reviews had been carried out and a record had not been kept.</p>
<p>
The DCT found the charges proved on Anderson’s own admission. It treated the first as an example of “reckless or serious negligence” and the second as an “unjustifiable ethical failing”, and imposed on him a severe reprimand, <br /> a £3,450 fine and costs of £3,225.</p>
<p>He appealed on the grounds that the specific charges were so trivial he could not properly be said to have brought discredit on himself, ICAEW or the profession; and the DCT had wrongly regarded as an aggravating factor the “dubious” coincidence that he had ceased conducting audits shortly before a Quality Assurance Department visit and in so doing had cast an unwarranted slur on him.</p>
<p>The appeal committee panel said that the first ground was an argument that could not succeed as “every audit registered firm, whatever the size and value of its practice, is required to keep to professional rules and standards”. However, on the second ground, he did have a point. Nothing during the DCT hearing suggested that it would be taken into account as a factor, nor was the point put to Anderson. The panel reduced the sanctions to a reprimand, a £1,500 fine and £1,500 costs.</p>

<p class="noindent"><b>Complaint</b> On 24 November 2011 the firm issued an audit report in respect of the 2010 financial statements of a client trust when, in breach of audit regulation 3.10, the audit was not conducted in accordance with various international standards on auditing (UK &amp; Ireland).

<p class="noindent">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="noindent">Under ISA 315, Identifying the risks of material misstatement, the firm failed to: obtain an understanding of the entity and its environment, including its internal control, to enable it to understand the classes of transactions, account balances and disclosures to be expected in the financial statements.</p>
