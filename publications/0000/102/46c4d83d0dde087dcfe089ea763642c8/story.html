<h2>CHILDHOOD AMBITION</h2><p>My ambition was to be an actress. I even auditioned for RADA when I was 17 but the principal told me to take my place at the University of Oxford, then come back. I did lots of acting and directing at Oxford, but after graduating I realised I wanted a baby soon and acting involved long periods away from home. So when my husband went to work in the City, I thought it would be a sensible route for me too.</p>
<h2>FIRST SENIOR ROLE</h2><p>Six years after graduating, I was made director of Mercury Asset Management. I was surprised to be made a director so early, but I worked very hard and had a sponsor, Leonard Licht, who was very powerful in Mercury. He really believed in me and put me forward for promotions. He’s largely the reason I got to the top so quickly. </p>
<h2>MY BIGGEST BUGBEAR</h2><p>Is the lack of affordable childcare, especially in London. It is holding back our economy and something needs to be done. </p>
<h2>I ADMIRED MRS THATCHER</h2><p>I didn't agree with all her policies, but I did admire her as a person. She had real conviction and, unlike most politicians today, wasn't driven by a need to please the press.</p>
<h2>IT'S IMPORTANT TO TREAT PEOPLE WELL</h2><p>My father used to say that the only thing that mattered in life was treating other people properly. I hope that when I retire I'll be able to look back and say I did.</p>
<h2>PROUDEST ACHIEVEMENT</h2><p>Leading and turning around Morgan Grenfell is my proudest achievement. The fact that I was female and young when I was made MD wasn’t really an obstacle. I was, however, very daunted at being expected to turn around a failing investment bank at the age of 31.</p>
<h2>WORK-LIFE BALANCE</h2><p>I was lucky that my children slept well. If you’re sleep deprived, you can’t work properly. I also chose a job that didn’t entail working evenings or weekends, so I could be with them. It wasn’t difficult to find the right balance. I felt happy and fulfilled, which made me a better mother.</p>
<h2>FUTURE PLANS</h2><p>I strongly believe the health of the UK economy depends on making adequate capital available to SMEs. Money&amp;Co will be one of those alternative capital providers, but one of the pressures we face is getting across our message. Many businesses have been turned down for loans by the banks so many times, they’ve given up trying.</p>
<h2>IT'S IMPORTANT TO UNWIND</h2><p>I enjoy walking in the park with my husband and our three whippets.</p>
