<p class="dropcap">One of the unexpected knock-on effects of the 2008 financial crisis is how much time financial services businesses have to spend dealing with information requests from regulators around the world. In some cases, this can be as high as 25% of internal audit time. It means that people are being taken away from the job they should be doing so that regulators can ensure they are never again caught out through lack of the right data, tools and skills.</p>
<p>The amount of information they are demanding from banks has increased exponentially in the belief that more and new data create opportunities for real-time and more sophisticated analysis around anomalies. But it seems to me that the pendulum may be in danger of swinging too far the other way. I worry that we are creating a situation where regulators are at risk of failing to gain useful insights that could identify emerging signs of the next crisis, because there is too much focus at a granular level.</p>
<p>You just have to look at the level of information heading in their direction. In the European Union, the Capital Requirements Directive’s new financial reporting requirements result in some large banking groups having to submit over 50,000 data fields quarterly. In the US, the provisions of the Dodds-Frank Act mean that an application to become a Swaps Execution Facility typically takes several thousand pages of data.</p>
<p>In order to meet these new regulatory requirements, financial institutions need to make major IT investment a priority – their current systems are typically old and patched together, and don’t allow for rapid response to requests for different data. But it is also becoming clear that the requirements are just as great a challenge for the regulators themselves. This is the world of big data and having the appropriate resources, technology, institutional skills and knowledge to do something with the information is essential.</p>
<p>The crisis taught us that people can rely too much on data and that, in any case, data is only useful to the extent that it is reliable. Data alone can never be the answer: human judgement will always be needed. Yet, as the echoes of the financial crisis fade and the banking sector bounces back, the regulators are being forced to compete with banks and consultancies for the skilled staff they need.</p>
<p>Central banks are trying to develop new analytical tools to allow them to cut through the data they receive in a way they haven’t been able to do historically. But experience shows that finding an IT solution to massive big data issues is hard to get right first time. I would urge all bank regulators to work together to find a solution that focuses more on the quality than the amount of data, and that gains real insight from the data to identify risks to the system.</p>
