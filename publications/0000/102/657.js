And just as it is hard for companies to grow without access to finance, so it becomes difficult for an economy to grow without a thriving community of entrepreneurs starting and growing businesses.</p>\n<p>To date, this has been most commonly presented as a simple issue of supply and demand. Representatives of those running small businesses say the issue is one of supply. They think the major banks are too busy rebuilding their own balance sheets (ready to meet a stricter regulatory regime) to consider helping small firms. They point to the fact that bank lending remains low as proof that their members are not getting access to the money they need. </p>\n<p>For their part, the banks and other traditional lenders point to a lack of demand, saying that small companies don’t have the confidence to borrow. Those running small businesses don’t feel the future is bright enough for them to take out loans at any cost, however low interest rates (and whatever help is on offer from government schemes).</p>\n<p>With interest rate rises now imminent, the fear and risk of being lent to by a major high-street bank is greater than ever. This partly explains the rising popularity of alternative sources of finance such as peer-to-peer lending.</p>\n<p>While the banks are responsible for the majority of UK business finance, there is no doubt that the options for businesses looking to raise finance are greater than they have ever been. This was one reason why the British Business Bank and ICAEW launched the Small Business Finance Guide last month.</p>\n<p>One of the major factors behind any business success story is the ability to access the right finance at the right time. Anything that helps those running businesses cut through the confusion, the better. But there is another important element of successful business funding. </p>\n<p>A major factor influencing both sides of any lending decision is the investment-readiness of the business itself and those running it. This is an area where chartered accountants have a crucial role to play. They can, and should, be the grease that helps to keep lending rolling.</p>\n<p>Having an independent assessment of the strengths and potential weaknesses of a business (as well as a permanent record from a trusted independent inspection of the books) can only stand a company in good stead when it comes to telling a story that will stack up for potential investors or lenders.</p>\n<p>But chartered accountants are looking beyond audit and taking on more business advisory work. Here again, they are better placed than most to offer advice on how to grow a sustainable business. More entrepreneurs and bankers should seek their advice. It’s also time more chartered accountants shouted about their ability   to build a finance-ready Britain.</p>\n","layout":{"landscape":{"id":"am-dp1-layout23","link":"story-landscape-layout12.twig"},"portrait":{"id":"am-dp1-layout24","link":"story-portrait-layout12.twig"}},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":"","link_source":"","image":[],"url_alias":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com","type":"story","order":"0","folio_number":"0","folio_numbers":"","pdf_page_index":"0","thumbnail":null,"color":"989898","real_id":"6037","main_section_id":"657","ads":[]},{"id":"247f8aa7e291e32e81f5996aef7648d7","title":"Did you feel the earth  move over Europe?","sub_title":"","author":[{"id":"0","name":"Emily Black","email":"emily.black@progressivecp.com","is_default":false}],"tag":"","strap_line":"Indifference rules the EU","short_intro":"","intro":"","body":"<p class=\"dropcap\">With the dust still settling on the “political earthquake” of the European elections, it’s not surprising that senior politicians across Europe have been squabbling hard over who will become the next European Commission president.</p>\n<p>Only a small proportion of voters took part in the elections and an even smaller number seemed to know they were also voting for the next president.
