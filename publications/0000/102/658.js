Separately, it is predicted that GDP could increase by as much as 5% in September when R&amp;D costs and black market activities are factored into the methodology.</p>\n<p>The Bank of England’s biannual Systematic Risk survey also showed that confidence in the City was healthy. In its survey of 72 asset managers, hedge funds, insurers and executives responsible for risk management, 64% said that the probability of a “high impact” event hitting the financial system over the short- and medium-term was low or very low. The number of people in employment also increased by a record 345,000 in the three months to April, bringing the UK unemployment rate down to 6.6%.</p>\n<p>But Oliver Burrows, credit analyst at Rabobank, counselled caution. “In some ways it feels like 2010: we have a crisis behind us, optimism is at a high and markets have short memories,” he said. “The risks have seemingly been put to bed – bank capital and liquidity, the euro crisis. But there is always risk hiding around the corner – the idea that there are no clouds on the horizon seems a little odd.”</p>\n<h2>BIG FOUR FEES BOOM</h2><p>The Big Four firms earned 10 times more in audit fees than the next six biggest accountancy practices combined, Financial Reporting Council statistics have shown.</p>\n<p>The Big Four earned 71% of the total fee income of audit firms in 2013 with an average income of £2.06bn, compared to the £202m earned by the next six firms combined. The next 20 firms earned just £23.148m last year in audit fees combined.</p>\n<p>However, the largest non-Big Four firms – Grant Thornton, BDO, Baker Tilly, and Mazars – enjoyed their best results in five years and saw their total fee income grow 2.6% last year, up from 0.6% growth in 2012. Meanwhile the Big Four saw their fee income rise by 3.9% in 2013, but the growth rate was significantly lower than previous years – it grew by 7.7% in 2012 and 5.7% in 2011.</p>\n<h2>MINIMUM WAGE TO BE ENFORCED BY FINES</h2><p>Under new rules that came into effect in October 2013 to name and shame employers that break the national minimum wage law, the government has now announced that employers who fail to pay workers the minimum wage will be fined as much as £20,000 per employee.</p>\n<p>After the Queen’s Speech last month, a list of 25 offending employers was released by HMRC, which between them owe more than £43,000 to workers. They include a school in Edinburgh that underpaid an employee by £3,739, a garage in Bradford that underpaid a worker by £6,426 and a central heating company in Hampshire that failed to pay £6,200 to four workers. Business minister Jenny Willott said: “If employers break the law they need to know they will face tough consequences.” The adult minimum wage, which currently stands at £6.31, will rise to £6.50 in October.</p>\n<h2>CYBERCRIME CRACKDOWN</h2><p>The Bank of England has announced rigorous testing of electronic defences to the UK’s biggest financial institutions. The new cyber security system, known as CBEST, will be used by private security firms and licensed computer hacking companies to spot weaknesses, but results are unlikely to be made public. Andrew Gracie, executive director of resolution at the BoE, said: “The results should provide a direct readout on a firm’s capability to withstand cyber attacks.”</p>\n<h2>THE INTERNATIONAL PICTURE</h2><p><b>THE AMOUNT OF PRIVATE WEALTH</b> held by households  around the world surged 14.6% to $152trn (£91trn) last year, thanks in part to rising stock markets, according to a report by management consulting firm, Boston Consulting Group. The fastest-growing region was Asia Pacific, which saw a 30.5% increase to $37trn (£21.7trn), largely a result  of strong nominal GDP growth in China and India.</p>\n<p>North America and western Europe remained the wealthiest regions in the world with private wealth of $50.3trn (£29.5trn) and $37.9trn (£22.2trn) respectively. However, Asia Pacific is projected to overtake them by 2018, with private wealth estimated to reach $61trn.</p>\n<p><b>ELSEWHERE IN THE WORLD</b>  Brazil’s economy continues to struggle despite the World Cup effect. Business investment fell 2.1% in the first three months of 2014, the biggest decline in two years, and the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics revised economic growth down to 0.4% in the last three months of 2013. Brazil’s economy has averaged just 2% growth each year since President Dilma Rousseff took office in 2011. Asked why the economy isn’t growing faster, Rousseff said last month: “You can’t explain why. All conditions point to Brazil not only growing, but growing well.”</p>\n<div class=\"am_info_box\">\n\t<fieldset>\n\t<legend><div>RISING STARS OF THE PROFESSION</div></legend>\n\t<div class=\"text\"><p><b>Do you know an ACA student who excelled in their exams or dazzled in the workplace?

Italy’s revenues grew by €97m in 2012-13, 75% of which was down to Juventus.</p>\n<h2>PUB LANDLORDS</h2><p>Struggling pub landlords will be protected by new measures to crack down on beer-tie agreements, where landlords are required to buy beer, often at high prices, from pub companies. Vince Cable said: “Far too many landlords feel their income is squeezed by big pub companies.”</p>\n<h2>CAR INSURERS</h2><p>Britain’s motor insurance industry made its first annual profit in 20 years, thanks to a clampdown on fraudulent claims. Insurers paid out £98.50 for every £100 received in premiums last year, according to EY. It is only the second time the motor insurance industry has made a profit since records began in 1985.</p>\n<h2>RAMSAY'S NIGHTMARES</h2><p>Accounts published in June showed celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay’s holdings company, Kavalake, made a £6.4m loss last year. He has plans to open a restaurant in Hong Kong this year, but in the UK he’s involved in a dispute over the lease of his London pub, the York &amp; Albany. Following a £2m profit the previous year, most of the loss relates to a provision on that lease. Oh, and £2m in legal fees.</p>\n<h2>JERSEY'S REGULATOR</h2><p>The Jersey Financial Services Commission was criticised for failing to act against a firm, nominally owned by a Jersey trust company accused of moving ‘blood gold’. “Authorities do not seem to be moving quickly,” said former UN investigator Kathi Austin.</p>\n<h2>BDO</h2><p>Former BDO US vice chairman Charles Bee was sentenced to 16 months in prison for his part in a tax shelter scheme that generated $6.5bn (£3.9bn) in bogus losses. Adrian Dicker, another former vice chairman, also pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 10 months in prison. It was described as the biggest tax shelter fraud in US history.</p>\n","layout":{"landscape":{"id":"am-dp1-layout1b","link":"story-landscape-layout1b.html"},"portrait":{"id":"am-dp1-layout2b","link":"story-portrait-layout1b.html"}},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":"","link_source":"","image":[{"id":"8267f5002113a7cc51ef34c948bad86c","name":"GMBM1","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com/var/economia/storage/images/gmbm1/56105-1-eng-GB/gmbm1_story_img_size_708x430.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"708","height":"430","is_default":true},{"id":"8267f5002113a7cc51ef34c948bad86c","name":"GMBM1","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com/var/economia/storage/images/gmbm1/56105-1-eng-GB/gmbm1_story_img_size_472x478.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"472","height":"478","is_default":false}],"related_objects":{"gallery":[[{"id":"5414dc23c1e0e98d089fddd4adedffe9","name":"GMBM4","source":"","caption":"<p>The Jersey Financial Services Commission was criticised for failing to act against a firm, nominally owned by a Jersey trust company accused of moving 'blood gold'</p>\n","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com/var/economia/storage/images/gmbm42/56117-1-eng-GB/gmbm4_default_ipad_portrait.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"768","height":"455"},{"id":"5414dc23c1e0e98d089fddd4adedffe9","name":"GMBM4","source":"","caption":"<p>The Jersey Financial Services Commission was criticised for failing to act against a firm, nominally owned by a Jersey trust company accused of moving 'blood gold'</p>\n","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com/var/economia/storage/images/gmbm42/56117-1-eng-GB/gmbm4_default_ipad_landscape.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"1024","height":"607"},{"id":"f47afda76967fe78b6a013068c39ef45","name":"GMBM2","source":"","caption":"<p>Accounts published in June showed that celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay's holding company, Kavalake, made a £6.4m loss last year</p>\n","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com/var/economia/storage/images/gmbm22/56131-1-eng-GB/gmbm2_default_ipad_portrait.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"768","height":"1024"},{"id":"f47afda76967fe78b6a013068c39ef45","name":"GMBM2","source":"","caption":"<p>Accounts published in June showed that celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay's holding company, Kavalake, made a £6.4m loss last year</p>\n","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com/var/economia/storage/images/gmbm22/56131-1-eng-GB/gmbm2_default_ipad_landscape.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"576","height":"768"},{"id":"2b274e00bb2a208bee632e92d0e24219","name":"GMBM3","source":"","caption":"<p>Struggling pub landlords will be protected by new measures to crack down on beer-tie agreements</p>\n","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com/var/economia/storage/images/gmbm32/56124-1-eng-GB/gmbm3_default_ipad_portrait.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"768","height":"490"},{"id":"2b274e00bb2a208bee632e92d0e24219","name":"GMBM3","source":"","caption":"<p>Struggling pub landlords will be protected by new measures to crack down on beer-tie agreements</p>\n","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com/var/economia/storage/images/gmbm32/56124-1-eng-GB/gmbm3_default_ipad_landscape.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"1024","height":"653"}]]},"url_alias":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com","type":"story","order":"3","folio_number":"0","folio_numbers":"","pdf_page_index":"0","thumbnail":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com/var/economia/storage/images/gmbm1/56105-1-eng-GB/gmbm1_tablet_story_thumbnail.jpg","color":"e00785","real_id":"6043","main_section_id":"658","ads":[]},{"id":"46c4d83d0dde087dcfe089ea763642c8","title":"As I see it","sub_title":"","author":[{"id":"0","name":"Emily Black","email":"emily.black@progressivecp.com","is_default":false}],"tag":"","strap_line":"As I see it: Nicola Horlick","short_intro":"","intro":"\"City superwoman” Nicola Horlick is CEO of Bramdean Asset Management, chairman of Rockpool Investments, and recently launched crowdfunding company Money&Co","body":"<h2>CHILDHOOD AMBITION</h2><p>My ambition was to be an actress. I even auditioned for RADA when I was 17 but the principal told me to take my place at the University of Oxford, then come back. I did lots of acting and directing at Oxford, but after graduating I realised I wanted a baby soon and acting involved long periods away from home. So when my husband went to work in the City, I thought it would be a sensible route for me too.</p>\n<h2>FIRST SENIOR ROLE</h2><p>Six years after graduating, I was made director of Mercury Asset Management. I was surprised to be made a director so early, but I worked very hard and had a sponsor, Leonard Licht, who was very powerful in Mercury. He really believed in me and put me forward for promotions. He’s largely the reason I got to the top so quickly. </p>\n<h2>MY BIGGEST BUGBEAR</h2><p>Is the lack of affordable childcare, especially in London. It is holding back our economy and something needs to be done. </p>\n<h2>I ADMIRED MRS THATCHER</h2><p>I didn't agree with all her policies, but I did admire her as a person. She had real conviction and, unlike most politicians today, wasn't driven by a need to please the press.</p>\n<h2>IT'S IMPORTANT TO TREAT PEOPLE WELL</h2><p>My father used to say that the only thing that mattered in life was treating other people properly. I hope that when I retire I'll be able to look back and say I did.</p>\n<h2>PROUDEST ACHIEVEMENT</h2><p>Leading and turning around Morgan Grenfell is my proudest achievement. The fact that I was female and young when I was made MD wasn’t really an obstacle. I was, however, very daunted at being expected to turn around a failing investment bank at the age of 31.</p>\n<h2>WORK-LIFE BALANCE</h2><p>I was lucky that my children slept well. If you’re sleep deprived, you can’t work properly. I also chose a job that didn’t entail working evenings or weekends, so I could be with them. It wasn’t difficult to find the right balance. I felt happy and fulfilled, which made me a better mother.</p>\n<h2>FUTURE PLANS</h2><p>I strongly believe the health of the UK economy depends on making adequate capital available to SMEs. Money&amp;Co will be one of those alternative capital providers, but one of the pressures we face is getting across our message. Many businesses have been turned down for loans by the banks so many times, they’ve given up trying.</p>\n<h2>IT'S IMPORTANT TO UNWIND</h2><p>I enjoy walking in the park with my husband and our three whippets.</p>\n","layout":{"landscape":{"id":"am-dp1-layout1","link":"story-landscape-layout1.html"},"portrait":{"id":"am-dp1-layout2","link":"story-portrait-layout1.html"}},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":"","link_source":"","image":[{"id":"5ce691230133bea11f9e25b03d1abe30","name":"as i see it","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com/var/economia/storage/images/as-i-see-it12/56138-1-eng-GB/as-i-see-it_story_img_size_708x430.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"709","height":"430","is_default":true},{"id":"5ce691230133bea11f9e25b03d1abe30","name":"as i see it","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com/var/economia/storage/images/as-i-see-it12/56138-1-eng-GB/as-i-see-it_story_img_size_472x478.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"472","height":"479","is_default":false}],"url_alias":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com","type":"story","order":"4","folio_number":"0","folio_numbers":"","pdf_page_index":"0","thumbnail":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com/var/economia/storage/images/as-i-see-it12/56138-1-eng-GB/as-i-see-it_tablet_story_thumbnail.jpg","color":"e00785","real_id":"6045","main_section_id":"658","ads":[]},{"id":"de7b2b078c2ad273b428670e6488adc0","title":"From the top","sub_title":"","author":[{"id":"0","name":"Emily Black","email":"emily.black@progressivecp.com","is_default":false}],"tag":"","strap_line":"From the top","short_intro":"","intro":"New president Arthur Bailey makes the case for mentoring","body":"<p class=\"dropcap\">Becoming president has made me think back to the time when I was a school leaver and in a quandary over what to do as a career. With a choice between banking or chartered accountancy, I plumped for the latter – a lucky move, as it turned out. I have to confess I had no understanding of the difference chartered accountants make every day when I started out but I soon realised how hugely relevant we are to business. As you know, today we advise 1.5m – that’s a third – of  all UK businesses.</p>\n<p class=\"dropcap\">We are also making a huge contribution to training and equipping young people from all walks of life with the skills to take advantage of the opportunities available in business. Forgive me if I get on my hobbyhorse, but this is not just of fundamental importance for the future of the profession, but personal as well.</p>\n<p class=\"dropcap\">As an 18-year-old, I was articled to an individual in a four-partner practice, effectively doing what we now call an apprenticeship. He was hugely important to my training and development. He was the person I talked to, who mentored me as far as work and professional ethics was concerned. I learned from him high ethical standards and an appreciation of what it means to belong to a respected profession.</p>\n<p class=\"dropcap\">So over the past few years I’ve been pleased to see the increasing contribution that ICAEW and the profession are making to young people’s development. Many of you are mentoring 16 to 19-year-olds through BASE, our national business game. ICAEW is involved closely in the Access Accountancy campaign to encourage school leavers to train in the profession; and we are currently opening up new routes into training.</p>\n<p class=\"dropcap\">I’m particularly delighted with the recent introduction – or should I say reintroduction? – of authorised training principals, which means that individual ICAEW members working in non-ICAEW firms can  train chartered accountants. It’s interesting how things have gone full circle and we are getting back to our roots on apprenticeships.</p>\n<p class=\"dropcap\">Even though the ATP scheme was set up only comparatively recently, we already have 18 members signed up and more in the pipeline. The offices they work in vary from commercial organisations (eight) to financial services (seven) and not-for profit or government bodies (three). It’s a great start and I hope many more of you will consider joining the scheme and playing your own part in shaping the future of the profession. After all, who knows, you might find yourself mentoring an equally grateful ICAEW president some years down the line.</p>\n","layout":{"landscape":{"id":"am-dp1-layout1","link":"story-landscape-layout1.html"},"portrait":{"id":"am-dp1-layout2","link":"story-portrait-layout1.html"}},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":"","link_source":"","image":[{"id":"367316bd8efd4f8773788fd294a83e8d","name":"from the top","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com/var/economia/storage/images/from-the-top4/56356-1-eng-GB/from-the-top_story_img_size_708x430.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"710","height":"430","is_default":true},{"id":"367316bd8efd4f8773788fd294a83e8d","name":"from the top","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com/var/economia/storage/images/from-the-top4/56356-1-eng-GB/from-the-top_story_img_size_472x478.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"472","height":"478","is_default":false}],"url_alias":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com","type":"story","order":"5","folio_number":"0","folio_numbers":"","pdf_page_index":"0","thumbnail":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com/var/economia/storage/images/from-the-top4/56356-1-eng-GB/from-the-top_tablet_story_thumbnail.jpg","color":"e00785","real_id":"6047","main_section_id":"658","ads":[]},{"id":"a5ebb796cfa87439712c2b6b6382cdbd","title":"ICAEW news","sub_title":"","author":[{"id":"0","name":"Emily Black","email":"emily.black@progressivecp.com","is_default":false}],"tag":"","strap_line":"ICAEW news","short_intro":"","intro":"Members on Queen’s birthday honours list, ICAEW welcomes its new president, and the launch of  a brand new app for members","body":"<h2>BIRTHDAY HONOURS FOR ICAEW MEMBERS</h2><p>Former ICAEW president Keith Woodley is one of nine ICAEW members to receive awards in this year’s Birthday Honours List.</p>\n<p>Woodley, who was president in 1995/96, stepped down last year as pro-Chancellor of Bath University and a member of its council after nearly 20 years of service. His CBE was for services to higher education.</p>\n<p>Four other members received CBEs. They include: Jane Barker, chief executive of Equitas, for services to the financial and insurance services industries and voluntary service; Peter Hensman, chairman of Cumbria Rural Enterprise Agency, for voluntary service to the rural economy in Cumbria; and Edward Leask, who teaches sailing part-time to youngsters at the Weymouth and Portland National Sailing Academy, for services to sailing, young people and philanthropy. Sharmila Nebhrajani, chief executive of the Association of Medical Research Charities, receives her CBE for services to medical research.</p>\n<p>MBEs went to Hallam Carter Pegg for services to young people in Croydon and to Glenn Crocker, chief executive of BioCity Nottingham, for services to the biotechnology industry, while OBEs went to Dharam Bir Lall for services to the community and businesses in Essex and the London Borough of Newham, and to Alan Wintersgill, for services to charity and to the community in Bingley, West Yorkshire.</p>\n<h2>NEW MAN AT THE TOP</h2><p>Business consultant Arthur Bailey has taken over as ICAEW president from former Deloitte partner Martyn Jones. He will be supported during his year in office  by PwC audit partner Andrew Ratcliffe as deputy president and Open University lecturer Hilary Lindsay as vice president.</p>\n<p>Speaking at his inaugural lunch, Bailey said that being a chartered accountant must have been in his stars and that appropriately enough he qualified the same year that the first man walked on the moon. “I have always been passionate about what the profession does for business and for society,” he confessed. “I count myself extremely lucky to have lived through an era in which our profession has spread around the globe, and where our skills are in many ways more and more in demand.</p>\n<p>“We are a hugely dynamic and relevant profession – to the economy, to business, to the public sector.”</p>\n<h2>FEES AND SUBS TO RISE</h2><p>Annual fees and subscriptions are to rise next year after ICAEW members voted overwhelmingly in support at the AGM and special meeting in June. This means that subs will go up by £10 to £340 while the admission fee for those living in the UK or Europe will increase by £18 to £626 and for those elsewhere by £9 to £313.</p>\n<p>Practising certificates will also be more expensive in 2015. For those living in the UK or Europe, the fee will be £161 (up from £156) and outside £74 (up from £72).</p>\n<h2>APP FOR MEMBERS LAUNCHED</h2><p>ICAEW has launched an app for members, which brings together different parts of ICAEW digital offerings, including tax tables, news and analysis from economia and contact details for fellow members.</p>\n<p>It also provides access to member benefits, including commercial benefits offered by ICAEW’s affinity partners, and can be used as a membership card.</p>\n<p>“We wanted to build an app that would offer something to all our members,” said ICAEW head of digital Faye Thomassen, “and we look forward to hearing feedback and potential features for future versions.”</p>\n<p>The app, which is currently only available on iPhone or iPad, can be downloaded from the Apple Store.</p>\n<p class=\"callaction\"><a href=\"http://www.icaew.com/en/icaew-terms-and-conditions/member-app\" target=\"_self\">icaew.com/memberapp</a></p>\n<div class=\"am_info_box\">\n\t<fieldset>\n\t<legend><div>EVENTS</div></legend>\n\t<div class=\"text\"><h2><b>29 AUGUST</b></h2><p><b>SCOTTISH BUSINESS CONFIDENCE</b></p>\n<p>This breakfast roundtable will consider the overall direction of the economy, what is driving change and what the current concerns of UK plc are.

As a financial journalist living and working in Scotland throughout the boom and crisis, it is inevitable that Fraser would want to turn his investigative beam on RBS. And he has been kept busy doing just that for the last few years, writing extensively on the banking crisis and the role RBS played in it. What was less certain was how sharp or relevant the book, when it came, would be. A lack of distance makes it somehow more difficult to afford recent events the same respect and quality of thought we afford more distant history. Fraser certainly pulls no punches here. The story of the hubris-heavy rise and painful fall of politicians’ former favourite banker Fred Goodwin and the empire he built is laid bare in all its gory details. </p>\n<p>In fact Fraser goes much further back in time, right back to the bank’s foundation, rather than just focusing on recent events. At times this is more like a biography of the bank. While this historical context is useful and vital to the retelling of the later (more recent) events, there is an inevitable danger that either the reader (and sometimes the writer) get caught up in the excitement. Some blameless novices among the earliest characters tend to be coloured somewhat by their association with the bank that would become the scandal-hit RBS of 2008.</p>\n<p>If there is plenty here to make squeamish bankers (do they exist?) look away, accountants (and auditors especially) also come in for some fairly hefty criticism. Fraser has been accused in the past of selecting the facts that best support his worldview; he argues that the facts speak for themselves and need little editing. But by selecting such a loaded and provocative title, it is clear he isn’t in this to offer a job reference for future employers of Fred Goodwin. It’s an enjoyable book and one that will upset as many as it infuriates.</p>\n<h2>BOLT FROM THE BLUE: NAVIGATING THE NEW WORLD OF CORPORATE CRISES MIKE PULLEN AND JOHN BRODIE DONALD (ELLIOTT &amp; THOMPSON, £20)</h2><p>What connects RBS with Tesco, BP with Nasa and Domino’s Pizza with Lehman Brothers? Nothing immediate, apart from the fact that all of them have experienced some sort of sudden crisis in what the authors describe as a “bolt from the blue”. Whether these events should be as shocking to senior management as they often end up being is one issue raised here.</p>\n<p>But the real focus of the book is what these and other crisis case studies teach about how a modern corporate catastrophe should be handled. Whether the issue is horsemeat in burgers or an exploding oil well, there are useful tips for all here.</p>\n","layout":{"landscape":{"id":"am-dp1-layout1","link":"story-landscape-layout1.html"},"portrait":{"id":"am-dp1-layout2","link":"story-portrait-layout1.html"}},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":"","link_source":"","image":[{"id":"8efa6415c1c7cbdad152a34ba3ec7844","name":"book review","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com/var/economia/storage/images/book-review11/56714-1-eng-GB/book-review_story_img_size_708x430.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"708","height":"430","is_default":true},{"id":"8efa6415c1c7cbdad152a34ba3ec7844","name":"book review","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com/var/economia/storage/images/book-review11/56714-1-eng-GB/book-review_story_img_size_472x478.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"472","height":"478","is_default":false}],"url_alias":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com","type":"story","order":"7","folio_number":"0","folio_numbers":"","pdf_page_index":"0","thumbnail":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com/var/economia/storage/images/book-review11/56714-1-eng-GB/book-review_tablet_story_thumbnail.jpg","color":"e00785","real_id":"6051","main_section_id":"658","ads":[]},{"id":"f4172bcb1c963256d835683f3b03fc81","title":"Career clinic","sub_title":"","author":[{"id":"0","name":"Emily Black","email":"emily.black@progressivecp.com","is_default":false}],"tag":"","strap_line":"Career clinic","short_intro":"","intro":"If Britain continues to ignore the voice of its business community, it will have a disastrous economic effect, warns Mark Freebairn","body":"<p class=\"dropcap\">There is a taboo subject I want to write about. My desire to address it could be a reaction to the many articles currently in the press that claim those who lead businesses are overpaid, overfed, snouts-in-trough devils. It could also be because when Standard Life and other key Scottish businesses dared to voice a concern that independence would be a bad thing for Scotland, the anti-business feeling was such that the ‘Yes’ vote went up in the polls. Or it could be because I recently asked a group of CFOs and audit chairs how they felt about their interaction with politicians, and they said: “We can’t work with them, so we have to work around them or ignore them.”</p>\n<p>Frankly, this is horrifying. Worse, the sheer scale of anti-business sentiment reduces the ability business has to engage with Britons about matters of substance such as investment, employment prospects, geographic growth, and so on. It is fading, if it has not already vanished. </p>\n<p>But not all people who run businesses are bad. There are some rogues – but there are rogues in all walks of life. Virtually everyone I have ever met in a senior position in an organisation takes their stewardship role extremely seriously. What’s more, business in the UK provides a tremendous amount to the country: employment, wages, tax, exports, profile and reputation, leadership, investment and more. And business could have a very strong voice when it comes to sustainable economic growth, which we desperately need long-term.</p>\n<p>Of course, there would be degrees of self-interest, as there is with any group that speaks to the public – police, regulators, press, politicians, Liverpool fans – but business ultimately wants to create value, which in turn promotes growth and investment and increases employment, wages, tax and so on. There is value in listening when it comes to economic matters. Or when considering whether independence would be good or bad for Scotland.</p>\n<p>I have neither the column inches nor the intelligence to explain why public and business engagement has got to this point. When you see major decisions taken by the public at large, and you hear the silence from business before and after that decision, I find myself wishing that it was shouting a bit more loudly and forcing others to listen. And more importantly, that its words were reported in a fair and balanced way.</p>\n","layout":{"landscape":{"id":"am-dp1-layout1","link":"story-landscape-layout1.html"},"portrait":{"id":"am-dp1-layout2","link":"story-portrait-layout1.html"}},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":"","link_source":"","image":[{"id":"ce3a40f3845be05f25300f53d9df1f72","name":"career-clinic","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com/var/economia/storage/images/career-clinic13/56166-1-eng-GB/career-clinic_story_img_size_708x430.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"708","height":"430","is_default":true},{"id":"ce3a40f3845be05f25300f53d9df1f72","name":"career-clinic","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com/var/economia/storage/images/career-clinic13/56166-1-eng-GB/career-clinic_story_img_size_472x478.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"472","height":"478","is_default":false}],"url_alias":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com","type":"story","order":"8","folio_number":"0","folio_numbers":"","pdf_page_index":"0","thumbnail":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com/var/economia/storage/images/career-clinic13/56166-1-eng-GB/career-clinic_tablet_story_thumbnail.jpg","color":"e00785","real_id":"6053","main_section_id":"658","ads":[]},{"id":"7494f75df107bff6bc478493c4081b70","title":"Tales from the frontline","sub_title":"","author":[{"id":"0","name":"Emily Black","email":"emily.black@progressivecp.com","is_default":false}],"tag":"","strap_line":"Tales from the frontline","short_intro":"","intro":"Ruby Sharma, partner at EY and principal of the Centre for Board Matters, on her long, hard slog to be accepted by the Big Four","body":"<p class=\"dropcap\">My mother wanted me to become a doctor but the sight of blood made me queasy so, partway through my medical degree, I transferred to an economics degree at Delhi University and never looked back. It was there, during an internship at the Indian affiliate of Ernst &amp; Whinney (now EY) that I met a wonderful partner and mentor who gave me hope that I could move to the UK to train as a chartered accountant. That’s exactly what I did.</p>\n<p>Ten days before I left India, I didn’t have a passport. My father borrowed money for my flight and off I went, determined not to return until I succeeded. Failure was not an option, so I worked all week, studied for my ACA on weekends and squeezed in a cleaning job to support myself.</p>\n<p>My goal from day one was to join a Big Eight firm, as my mentor in Delhi had qualified with one. In particular, I was keen to train with Arthur Andersen, the gold standard in the profession at the time. However, I was a non-UK graduate so Andersen and the other Big Eight firms (today, the Big Four) wouldn’t even interview me, let alone employ me. Instead I joined regional firm Haines Watts.</p>\n<p>By my third year I was consulting and assisting the office managing partner. I also earned the highest marks in the county for two ACA papers so, when I qualified, I was convinced I was on par with the Oxbridge candidates Andersen employed. I applied again, but again they wouldn’t accept me.</p>\n<p>Only when I had done stints with Grant Thornton in Germany and London did Andersen finally employ me. The feeling was incredible. Finally, I had been accepted. The experience of working for a Big Eight firm was wonderful; in particular the quality of the resources, clients, fellow professionals and leaders.</p>\n<p>Though I progressed quickly and steadily, I often felt different to my peers. I spoke English perfectly but with a very different accent (I still have an amalgamation of accents.) At times people picked on things I said, and even laughed at me. I also felt I had to work three times harder than everyone else because I am an outsider, a woman and a non-native English speaker. I still feel that today.</p>\n<p>But I have tremendous drive. That’s why I jumped at the chance when a managing partner in Andersen’s New York practice invited me to join a new division that would later become known as forensic accounting. Forensic accounting barely existed in the 1990s. We started as a team of five and, by the time Andersen collapsed, we were a team of nearly 30.</p>\n<p>From there, I moved to EY’s forensic and investigations department where I stayed for eight more fascinating years. In this post-Enron world, forensic accounting went to a whole new level. As businesses became more sophisticated with the advent of technology and globalisation, so too did business fraud, adding extra layers of complexity.</p>\n<p>Yet moving to EY took some adjusting. Culturally, the firms were very different: Andersen was extremely entrepreneurial and fast paced and, even in those early days, it had specialists in computer fraud. EY didn’t at the time. It was far more conflict averse and made decisions thoughtfully and carefully.</p>\n<p>However, I am attracted to the new and unknown. That’s why I flew to the UK determined to make it into the Big Eight. That’s also why I specialised in forensic accounting when it was an unknown field. And that’s why, three years ago, I left forensic accounting behind to become principal of EY’s Centre for Board Matters. My motto is: ‘when you start getting comfortable, get uncomfortable’. That’s the only way to keep pushing yourself and achieve what you’re truly capable of.</p>\n","layout":{"landscape":{"id":"am-dp1-layout1","link":"story-landscape-layout1.html"},"portrait":{"id":"am-dp1-layout2","link":"story-portrait-layout1.html"}},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":"","link_source":"","image":[{"id":"d0908023a25b6466949f6326bc4cda65","name":"frontline","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com/var/economia/storage/images/frontline3/56152-1-eng-GB/frontline_story_img_size_708x430.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"708","height":"430","is_default":true},{"id":"d0908023a25b6466949f6326bc4cda65","name":"frontline","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com/var/economia/storage/images/frontline3/56152-1-eng-GB/frontline_story_img_size_472x478.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"472","height":"478","is_default":false}],"url_alias":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com","type":"story","order":"9","folio_number":"0","folio_numbers":"","pdf_page_index":"0","thumbnail":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com/var/economia/storage/images/frontline3/56152-1-eng-GB/frontline_tablet_story_thumbnail.jpg","color":"e00785","real_id":"6055","main_section_id":"658","ads":[]},{"id":"3de2ba84ca3e040d2eb096570558d8e8","title":"The graph","sub_title":"","author":[{"id":"0","name":"Emily Black","email":"emily.black@progressivecp.com","is_default":false}],"tag":"","strap_line":"The graph","short_intro":"","intro":"","body":"","layout":{"landscape":{"id":"am-dp1-layout3","link":"story-landscape-layout2.html"},"portrait":{"id":"am-dp1-layout4","link":"story-portrait-layout2.html"}},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":"","link_source":"","image":[{"id":"d37d69bd8a04bf483175a31782c586b2","name":"The graph","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com/var/economia/storage/images/the-graph5/56072-1-eng-GB/the-graph_story_img_size_708x0.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"708","height":"893","is_default":true},{"id":"d37d69bd8a04bf483175a31782c586b2","name":"The graph","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com/var/economia/storage/images/the-graph5/56072-1-eng-GB/the-graph_story_img_size_964x464.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"964","height":"464","is_default":false}],"url_alias":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com","type":"story","order":"10","folio_number":"0","folio_numbers":"","pdf_page_index":"0","thumbnail":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com/var/economia/storage/images/the-graph5/56072-1-eng-GB/the-graph_tablet_story_thumbnail.jpg","color":"e00785","real_id":"6057","main_section_id":"658","ads":[]}],"type":null,"ads":[]}}
