In some cases, this can be as high as 25% of internal audit time. It means that people are being taken away from the job they should be doing so that regulators can ensure they are never again caught out through lack of the right data, tools and skills.</p>\n<p>The amount of information they are demanding from banks has increased exponentially in the belief that more and new data create opportunities for real-time and more sophisticated analysis around anomalies. But it seems to me that the pendulum may be in danger of swinging too far the other way. I worry that we are creating a situation where regulators are at risk of failing to gain useful insights that could identify emerging signs of the next crisis, because there is too much focus at a granular level.</p>\n<p>You just have to look at the level of information heading in their direction. In the European Union, the Capital Requirements Directive’s new financial reporting requirements result in some large banking groups having to submit over 50,000 data fields quarterly. In the US, the provisions of the Dodds-Frank Act mean that an application to become a Swaps Execution Facility typically takes several thousand pages of data.</p>\n<p>In order to meet these new regulatory requirements, financial institutions need to make major IT investment a priority – their current systems are typically old and patched together, and don’t allow for rapid response to requests for different data. But it is also becoming clear that the requirements are just as great a challenge for the regulators themselves. This is the world of big data and having the appropriate resources, technology, institutional skills and knowledge to do something with the information is essential.</p>\n<p>The crisis taught us that people can rely too much on data and that, in any case, data is only useful to the extent that it is reliable. Data alone can never be the answer: human judgement will always be needed. Yet, as the echoes of the financial crisis fade and the banking sector bounces back, the regulators are being forced to compete with banks and consultancies for the skilled staff they need.</p>\n<p>Central banks are trying to develop new analytical tools to allow them to cut through the data they receive in a way they haven’t been able to do historically. But experience shows that finding an IT solution to massive big data issues is hard to get right first time. I would urge all bank regulators to work together to find a solution that focuses more on the quality than the amount of data, and that gains real insight from the data to identify risks to the system.</p>\n","layout":{"landscape":{"id":"am-dp1-layout31","link":"story-landscape-layout16.html"},"portrait":{"id":"am-dp1-layout32","link":"story-portrait-layout16.html"}},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":"","link_source":"","image":[{"id":"61a1db21daca89ddcf5d623c73760384","name":"Michael Izza","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com/var/economia/storage/images/michael-izza18/56917-1-eng-GB/michael-izza_story_img_size_190x132.png","portrait":true,"width":"190","height":"132","is_default":true},{"id":"61a1db21daca89ddcf5d623c73760384","name":"Michael Izza","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com/var/economia/storage/images/michael-izza18/56917-1-eng-GB/michael-izza_story_img_size_259x180.png","portrait":false,"width":"259","height":"180","is_default":false}],"url_alias":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com","type":"story","order":"11","folio_number":"0","folio_numbers":"","pdf_page_index":"0","thumbnail":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com/var/economia/storage/images/michael-izza18/56917-1-eng-GB/michael-izza_tablet_story_thumbnail.png","color":"27c4bd","real_id":"6059","main_section_id":"659","ads":[]},{"id":"6dcda8122594026d8641e9b3fabd84c6","title":"Your feedback","sub_title":"","author":[{"id":"0","name":"Emily Black","email":"emily.black@progressivecp.com","is_default":false}],"tag":"","strap_line":"Your feedback","short_intro":"","intro":"","body":"<h2 class=\"noindent\">IT'S WRONG TO LET HMRC GET ITS HANDS ON OUR BANK ACCOUNTS</h2><p class=\"noindent\">As a retired chartered accountant I am appalled at the erosion of civil liberties our profession is allowing to happen at the hands of HMRC. I refer in particular to RTI, and HMRC’s intention “to reach into people’s bank accounts and yoink money it thinks it is owed” (editorial comment, June 2014).</p>\n<p>RTI is the action of a police state seeking to control taxpayers’ income. Is the rise of self-employment, reported in the press, an unintended consequence of RTI? Will the next step be for industry to send over its monthly/weekly payroll to HMRC to decide how much is paid to employees? What will happen with powers of RTI in the hands of a left-wing socialist government?</p>\n<p>I appreciate that RTI is limited to curbing welfare payments, but could it be that taxing income is causing poverty and thus the need for welfare. As the need for welfare increases, so taxes have to increase to attempt to meet the costs.</p>\n<p>I’d like to make one further point about the development of the police state. In my 2013/2014 self assessment return there is no space to claim married couples allowance (MCA). It is only because I am aware that I am entitled to MCA that I scoured ‘Brief notes: Tax Return’. On page 7 it states: “Please use the Additional Information pages for MCA”, which were not sent. Is this dishonest practice by HMRC, ie, making it difficult to claim MCA?</p>\n<p>Surely the profession has to wake up to fulfil our public duty of protecting the public interest?</p>\n<p class=\"noindent\"><b>Peter Seaton</b></p>\n<h2 class=\"noindent\">IASB AND FASB CONVERGE ON REVENUE RECOGNITION</h2><p class=\"noindent\">In the FRC’s paper published on 4 June entitled True and Fair, the document stresses the overriding requirement for financial statements to show a true and fair view, even those prepared under IFRS. Where the FRC continues to be mistaken is to claim that IFRS-based financial statements necessarily give a true and fair view because “no IFRS can be endorsed by the EU if compliance  with it is inconsistent with a true and  fair view”.</p>\n<p>It was for that reason that the EU failed to endorse the fair-value accounting aspects of international standards except at group level. The EU could see that compliance at entity level was inconsistent with a true and fair view in some areas. The UK profession should have stood up for truth and fairness as well, instead of being willing to permit globalisation at any price regardless of the impact on the financial system.</p>\n<p class=\"noindent\"><b>Ian Sunderland</b></p>\n<p>If ICAEW is right in claiming a fair presentation is the same as a true and fair view, why didn’t it argue for a true and fair view for revenue regardless of what the varying standards required? A true and fair view should be all-pervasive even where defective guidance such as UITF 40 (and IAS 39) was in place.</p>\n<p class=\"noindent\"><b>Zeberdee</b> </p>\n<h2 class=\"noindent\">WOULD LEAVING THE EU HARM UK EXPORTS?</h2><p class=\"noindent\">When Andy Bagnall argues that, “Being inside a reformed EU is vital to future jobs, exports and growth,” (Debate, June 2014) he undermines it already. The EU is not reformed and there are entrenched interests against the idea. Can he support continued membership of the EU as it continues to be evermore intrusive, expensive and corrupt?</p>\n<p class=\"noindent\"><b>D James</b></p>\n<h2 class=\"noindent\">UKIP MEP IN LAND ROW</h2><p class=\"noindent\">Was this report planted by William Dartmouth? I wonder only because it shows him to be a man with very sensible views on trade and windmills and roughly well-qualified to represent the good citizens of the South West. Usually economia only mentions his party in order to criticise. Please can we have more like him in parliament and also in the ICAEW.</p>\n<p class=\"noindent\"><b>Epping Blogger</b></p>\n<p>I once attended a UKIP public meeting, out of curiosity, and heard Lord Dartmouth deliver what I personally considered to be an incoherent rant.</p>\n<p>I find it difficult to believe that the same person could have had an Eton and Oxford education and passed ICAEW exams. Which, I suppose, just goes to show how we all change over time.</p>\n<p>I’m afraid I cannot agree that we need more like him in either the Westminster or EU parliaments, or for that matter in the ICAEW.</p>\n<p class=\"noindent\"><b>South West Constituent</b> </p>\n<h2 class=\"noindent\">HMRC SERVICE STANDARDS CONTINUE TO DISAPPOINT</h2><p class=\"noindent\">Staffing levels at the customer service centres must be extremely low as I called the employers’ helpline and was waiting in a queue for 22 minutes to speak to someone. Compare this with the immediate response time when you call the collector of taxes – it can only show you where HMRC are allocating  their resources.</p>\n<p class=\"noindent\"><b>Taxagent</b> </p>\n<h2 class=\"noindent\">FRC PUBLISHED BIG FOUR AUDIT REPORTS</h2><p>More in-depth, forensic auditing techniques would have exposed the recent disastrous banking policies, for example, much earlier in the cycle. But, this would have meant higher audit costs to clients. In recent years, audits have been dumbed down and skim across the top – to compete on fees, I suggest.</p>\n<p>Do we place too much reliance on letters of representation? It’s time we accountants stood up for the importance of audit work to our clients.</p>\n<p>Michel Barnier, the European Commission’s internal markets commissioner (below), is quoted as saying auditors were “the dog that didn’t bark”.</p>\n<p class=\"noindent\"><b>David Thornton</b></p>\n<p class=\"noindent\">“The state of Bank audits continues to disappoint.” Banks had a major input  into the 2008 credit crash. Banks continue to award significant compensation packages, regardless of performance. Banks are helping to finance another imminent financial catastrophe. Moral hazard ruled the day.</p>\n<p>When is somebody, with clout, going to put banks in their place? Don’t bother splitting banks up into good and bad banks. Let them fail and, guess what, new financiers will spring up.</p>\n<p class=\"noindent\"><b>Brian Thomas</b></p>\n<p>It is simply fantastic that any number of public regulators, and indeed also the ICAEW, have totally failed to castigate, penalise and criminalise in public the individual partners of the Big Four that signed off the accounts.</p>\n<p class=\"noindent\"><b>Charles C</b></p>\n<p class=\"noindent\"> </p>\n<p class=\"callaction\"><b>The <i>economia</i> website is regularly updated with news and technical stories.

Leaving the car, I made my way uphill to where a small group of Fijian soldiers, part of a UN peacekeeping mission, peered through telescopes into the Syrian villages below.</p>\n<p>Of the two nearest villages, I was told that one was held by Syrian government forces; the other was under rebel control. You could hear artillery fire and explosions. The war felt very close indeed.</p>\n<p>A few weeks after my visit, an Israeli youth was killed in the Golan Heights after a truck in which he was travelling with his father was hit by a missile fired from inside Syria, the first such death since the start of the Syrian war in 2011. The Israelis responded with the inevitable air strikes on “strategic targets”. </p>\n<p>Since the 1973 Yom Kippur War, the Syrian border has been Israel’s quietest. That’s no longer so. The Syrian civil war has been raging now for three years and has created the conditions in which atrocity-minded jihadists and rebel militias have flourished.</p>\n<h2 class=\"noindent\">ALL OUT SUNNI-SHIA WAR</h2><p class=\"noindent\">The swift and devastating advance into Iraq by the Sunni-militant group Isis (the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham) seemed to take the West by surprise. It shouldn’t have. The porous border between Iraq and Syria has allowed militants to move freely. A blood-dimmed tide is washing over the Middle East and what we are witnessing is nothing less than an all-out Sunni-Shia war.</p>\n<p>Isis are battle-hardened, fanatical and utterly ruthless. Fighting for and alongside them are young British men, disaffected Sunni Muslims who have been radicalised in mosques in England, Scotland and Wales and who have gone to Syria in search of adventure and self-validation. They see themselves as holy warriors, fighters for Islam. And they are of serious concern to the British security forces.</p>\n<p>What the British government fears more than anything else at present is blowback. “Foreign policy,” David Miliband once said to me when he was Foreign Secretary, “is inseparable from domestic policy now. Is terrorism foreign policy  or domestic policy? It’s both. It’s the same with crime, with the economy, climate change.”</p>\n<p>It is estimated that as many as 150,000 people have been killed since the start of the Syrian war, notwithstanding all those who have been maimed and injured and the millions who have fled the country seeking refuge in camps in Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan and even Bulgaria. In truth, the number of dead could be much higher: a senior commander in the Israel Defence Force told me that more than 300,000 had been killed. </p>\n<h2 class=\"noindent\">PETTY AND ATTRITIONAL</h2><p class=\"noindent\">Domestic politics in Britain can at times seem petty and attritional. Our politicians quarrel about anything from immigration (even though they can do nothing to control the free movement of labour in the EU) to the “cost of living crisis” and the slump in real wages.</p>\n<p>What is missing is a largeness of vision, from all three main parties, a sense of what kind of country Britain should be in a truly globalised age. Should it be open to the world, internationalist, free-trading, welcoming to economic migrants? Or should it retreat behind a shield of immigration quotas, euroscepticism and protectionism?</p>\n<p>Clearly not enough has been done by the great powers to end the slaughter in Syria. The UN Security Council is divided along old cold war lines and this weakness has merely emboldened the Assad regime in Syria and encouraged it to dig in.</p>\n<p>There is no indication that the war in Syria will end any time soon and, as I write, the Isis advance towards Baghdad has been halted but the survival of the state of Iraq itself, created after the First World War, has never seemed more precarious.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, videos of young British jihadists in Syria and Iraq are being uploaded to the internet, creating fear. What alarms the Westminster elite is what might happen when some of these men come home. As David Miliband said: “Foreign and domestic policy are now inseparable.”</p>\n","layout":{"landscape":{"id":"am-dp1-layout31","link":"story-landscape-layout16.html"},"portrait":{"id":"am-dp1-layout32","link":"story-portrait-layout16.html"}},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":"","link_source":"","image":[{"id":"72d64b96c840760a1693b09353b79bfc","name":"Jason Cowley","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com/var/economia/storage/images/jason-cowley13/56370-1-eng-GB/jason-cowley_story_img_size_190x132.png","portrait":true,"width":"190","height":"132","is_default":true},{"id":"72d64b96c840760a1693b09353b79bfc","name":"Jason Cowley","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com/var/economia/storage/images/jason-cowley13/56370-1-eng-GB/jason-cowley_story_img_size_259x180.png","portrait":false,"width":"259","height":"180","is_default":false}],"url_alias":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com","type":"story","order":"13","folio_number":"0","folio_numbers":"","pdf_page_index":"0","thumbnail":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com/var/economia/storage/images/jason-cowley13/56370-1-eng-GB/jason-cowley_tablet_story_thumbnail.png","color":"27c4bd","real_id":"6061","main_section_id":"659","ads":[]},{"id":"e392d9029fecfd4d62e7ff165c0331a0","title":"“There are remarkably few signs that the tax system is treated as a crucial part of the infrastructure”","sub_title":"","author":[{"id":"0","name":"Emily Black","email":"emily.black@progressivecp.com","is_default":false}],"tag":"","strap_line":"Paul Johnson","short_intro":"","intro":"","body":"<p class=\"dropcap\">For every £10 worth of output produced or consumed in the UK, nearly £4 is taken in tax. That’s what it takes to fund the pensions and health care, education and roads, and all the other public services we expect.</p>\n<p>A tax system on that scale inevitably has a huge effect. Its design matters for economic growth, for productivity and for equity. Every effort ought to be made to ensure that it operates as well as possible and causes as few economic problems  as possible. If it did we could all be better off.</p>\n<p>But there are remarkably few signs that the tax system is treated as the crucial part of the economic infrastructure that it clearly is. You can see that both in the process through which tax policy is made and in the policy that emerges.</p>\n<p>By contrast with most other policy areas, there are no strategies, no Green or White Papers. Big decisions tend to be handed down in the annual Budget, with little sense of how they fit with last year’s decisions and often no indication as to how they fit with a longer term direction. There isn’t even a parliamentary select committee with a specific remit to look at tax policy.</p>\n<h2 class=\"noindent\">LACKING RATIONALE</h2><p class=\"noindent\">What matters, though, is what comes out of the policymaking machine. And it’s not pretty. You can have a reasonable argument about all sorts of features of a tax system. But the current system abounds with features for which it is difficult to think of any good rationale.</p>\n<p>We have two completely separate taxes on earnings: income tax and National Insurance Contributions. The latter is no more than another tax. This creates complexity, lack of transparency and additional costs for business. Rates of NI have consistently risen as rates of income tax have fallen thereby, almost certainly unintentionally, increasing the tax on earnings, and workers, relative to the tax on other incomes, and pensioners.</p>\n<p>The current government, in spending multiple billions on increasing the income tax allowance, has taken almost no worker out of direct tax because the NI threshold has not risen. Rather than address this, the opposition want to reintroduce the 10p income tax rate they introduced and then abolished when in government. They also introduced, in a completely obscure way, a 60p income tax rate on incomes over £100,000. The current government has extended to £120,000 the range of income affected by that 60p rate.</p>\n<p>Other aspects of the tax system which defy rational explanation include a VAT system which is just about the narrowest in the OECD because our system of zero rating is so extensive, a council tax system which is deliberately regressive and still based on 1991 values, and an ever increasing tax on housing transactions – Stamp Duty – designed such that, in the extreme, a £1 increase in price can trigger an additional £40,000 tax bill. </p>\n<h2 class=\"noindent\">CONSTANT CHARGE</h2><p class=\"noindent\">But perhaps the most damaging aspect of the system lies in the rate of change and degree of uncertainty in tax policy. If there is one area where some degree of stability and certainty is vital surely it is in the taxation of pensions. But the tax regime keeps changing. What’s worse nobody has the least idea what will happen next.</p>\n<p>In recent years there have been annual changes to the levels and structures of business rates, corporation tax allowances and carbon taxes. Consider the annual investment allowance, which allows the immediate deduction of expenditure on most machinery from taxable profits. The limit was set at £50,000 between 2008 and 2010, when it increased to £100,000. It was cut to just £25,000 in 2012 but increased to £250,000 in 2013. In the 2014 Budget it was raised again to £500,000, but on current plans it will return to £25,000 in 2016. How is that supposed to help businesses?</p>\n<p>This matters. It may not be obvious, but the layering of complexity upon uncertainty upon inefficiency increases costs, encourages avoidance, disincentivises work and investment, distorts decisions and creates inequities. We can do better.</p>\n<p class=\"noindent\"> </p>\n<p class=\"callaction\"><b>The IFS residential conference in September focuses on:  “Taxing remuneration: principles and practice”  </b><a href=\"http://www.ifs.org.uk/events/1025\" target=\"_self\">www.ifs.org.uk/events/1025</a></p>\n<p class=\"callaction\"><b>Paul Johnson, Institute for Fiscal Studies </b></p>\n","layout":{"landscape":{"id":"am-dp1-layout31","link":"story-landscape-layout16.html"},"portrait":{"id":"am-dp1-layout32","link":"story-portrait-layout16.html"}},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":"","link_source":"","image":[{"id":"040e91c6df3e701d3ad30d32577faece","name":"Paul Johnson","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com/var/economia/storage/images/paul-johnson4/56964-1-eng-GB/paul-johnson_story_img_size_190x132.png","portrait":true,"width":"190","height":"132","is_default":true},{"id":"040e91c6df3e701d3ad30d32577faece","name":"Paul Johnson","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com/var/economia/storage/images/paul-johnson4/56964-1-eng-GB/paul-johnson_story_img_size_259x180.png","portrait":false,"width":"259","height":"180","is_default":false}],"url_alias":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com","type":"story","order":"14","folio_number":"0","folio_numbers":"","pdf_page_index":"0","thumbnail":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com/var/economia/storage/images/paul-johnson4/56964-1-eng-GB/paul-johnson_tablet_story_thumbnail.png","color":"27c4bd","real_id":"6063","main_section_id":"659","ads":[]},{"id":"25810251d8735504ed403f744638b888","title":"“If the Scottish tectonic plates have yet to shift, what of the earthquake that’s already happened?”","sub_title":"","author":[{"id":"0","name":"Emily Black","email":"emily.black@progressivecp.com","is_default":false}],"tag":"","strap_line":"Cathy Newman","short_intro":"","intro":"","body":"<p class=\"dropcap\">Politicians are a hyperbolic lot. And I admit it: journalists aren’t much better. So when Nigel Farage delivered his promised “political earthquake” at the European and local elections, the headline writers eagerly lapped up his purple prose. Which begs the question: what on earth will we all say and write if Scotland votes to quit the UK?</p>\n<p>So with only a few months to go until the seismic vote on the country’s future, FactCheck has been poring over the rival claims of the Yes and No camps. The most glaring contradiction is the Treasury’s boast that Scots will benefit to the tune of £1,400 a year if they stay in the Union – versus the Scottish Nationalist government’s talk of an annual independence “bonus” of £1,000.</p>\n<p>First, some agreed facts. Public spending per head is about 10% higher in Scotland than the UK average. But tax revenue from oil and gas in Scottish waters more than makes up for that. Giving Scotland a geographical share of oil revenues, the country’s paid in a bit more than it’s taken out in recent years.</p>\n<h2 class=\"noindent\">SALMOND'S FAIR POINT</h2><p class=\"noindent\">So when Scotland’s first minister Alex Salmond moans that Scots “are getting a raw deal under the current arrangement – paying more into Westminster than we get out”, he has a point.</p>\n<p>But a newly independent Scotland would still start with a net fiscal deficit. It might, however, be smaller as a percentage of GDP than the UK deficit, as it has been in four out of the last five years.</p>\n<p>The Scottish government thinks this will remain the case in a newly independent country. The Treasury disagrees. And here’s why: Salmond uses a much more optimistic projection of future oil earnings than the Treasury does.</p>\n<p>The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) sides with the Treasury, drawing on evidence from the Office for Budget Responsibility. As the IFS, in its usual sober way, puts it: “Whilst it may turn out to be the case that the Scottish economy does a great deal better after independence than it would as part of the UK, planning on this as a central assumption seems less than cautious.” So if the Scottish tectonic plates have yet to shift, what of the earthquake that’s already happened?</p>\n<p>Nigel Farage’s extraordinary victory was one in the eye for the mainstream political parties, Europe – and those much-maligned Romanians. The UKIP leader built his campaign around popular concerns about mass migration. Labour and the liberal media recoiled in horror when Farage said he’d feel uncomfortable living next door to a family of Romanians. But the voters (or at least those who bothered to turn out) took him to their hearts.</p>\n<h2 class=\"noindent\">ALLEGATIONS REPEATED</h2><p class=\"noindent\">While he apologised for what he’d said about his putative neighbours, he went on to repeat allegations about the crimes supposedly committed by Romanians. Was he right?</p>\n<p>First up: “92 per cent of all ATM crime in London is committed by Romanians.” It’s quite a figure, and it’s one that was first attributed to detective chief inspector Paul Barnard, then head of the Met’s Dedicated Cheque and Plastic Crime Unit. He made the claim in an ITV documentary in 2012. We’ve since been back to Scotland Yard and asked them for the data to support it. None was forthcoming, but they assured us it was “based on police intelligence”.</p>\n<p>Next: “28,000 Romanians were arrested in the last five years in the Metropolitan Police area alone.” The number is accurate, and comes from a Met Police Freedom of Information release. However, Farage has misquoted it – 28,000 is the number of arrests, not the number of crimes committed.</p>\n<p>Still, it’s a sizeable figure. Only the Poles have a higher number of arrests and there are many more Poles in London than there are Romanians.</p>\n<p>Finally: “7% of all crime across the 28 EU member states was caused by 240 gangs.” This comes from a Times article, which quoted Europol director Rob Wainright. But again Farage has got it slightly skewed.
