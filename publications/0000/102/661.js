He tells Raymond Doherty about his passion for football, finance and philanthropy","body":"<p class=\"dropcap\">When David Bernstein was appointed Football Association chairman in 2011, he was portrayed in the press as a “safe pair of hands” and a steady influence. This was exactly what the beleaguered body needed to steer it through the rocky waters stirred up by the failure of England’s 2018 World Cup bid and the abrupt resignation of his predecessor. And as I walk into Bernstein’s home, where I am warmly greeted while his grandchildren’s toys are tidied away for the ensuing photo shoot, this is exactly how he seems in person too.</p>\n<p>Yet beneath his friendly manner and obvious comfort with journalists is a pioneering individual who is unafraid of making bold decisions. He spoke as the lone dissenting voice at world football governing body FIFA against the re-election of president Sepp Blatter; pushed the notoriously traditionalist FA to appoint its first female director; and delivered the news to a club legend and his boyhood hero that his time was up.</p>\n<p>This mix of diplomacy and independence laid the foundations for a career that saw him advance from trainee accountant at Robson Rhodes to some of the most prominent executive roles in the UK. “I quite like it in the trenches,” he confides over coffee. “When you really need to rally people together and there’s need for radical change, I actually enjoy pressure. As long as you believe you’re doing the right thing and — I use this phrase quite carefully — coming from a strong moral base.”</p>\n<p>This principled approach led to the incident for which his tenure at the FA is most remembered — handling the accusation that then-England captain John Terry racially abused a fellow player on the pitch. Bernstein was instrumental in stripping Terry of the skipper’s armband before a full investigation had been completed. It ultimately led to manager Fabio Capello resigning. “We did the right thing,” he says with confidence.</p>\n<p>Born in St Helens in 1943, Bernstein moved to London and qualified with Robson Rhodes as a chartered accountant in 1966. His career choice was made by process of elimination. “I always had a fancy for business and numbers and wanted to get a professional qualification. I wasn’t suited to the medical-type professions and the law never appealed. I liked the feel of finance, although you’re never quite sure what you’re in for. I went straight into articles, as they were then, after my A-levels.”</p>\n<p>Following a year at Hacker Young, he moved on to Bright Grahame Murray, making partner at 25. He spent the next 20 years there before joining brand management business Pentland Group as joint chief executive. Funded by money from the sale of Reebok, Pentland went from strength to strength, acquiring established brands including Speedo and Berghaus, and getting “very close” to buying Adidas. Although it was a “fabulous time”, towards the end he wanted more control of his diary. He took on a series of chairman and non-executive positions in the retail industry at Blacks Leisure, Ted Baker and French Connection (where he oversaw the controversial 1990s FCUK advertising campaign) that helped transform the brand and garnered himself a reputation for turning around failing firms.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"right\" ><span class=\"hide\">\"</span><p>&quot;I felt that members of the board were being seduced into doing rash deals. That tightness and togetherness we had dissipated.&quot;</p>\n<span class=\"hide\">\"</span></blockquote>\n<p>But then a chance meeting in 1993 presented an opportunity to become a part of Manchester City, the football team he had idolised as a boy. “Why I chose them and not United or Liverpool I’m not sure,” he confesses. “Perhaps because of the colours, the sky blue.” As Bernstein remembers, he was “chasing some guy in the north” for a very big personal guarantee for Pentland: “He phoned me and asked if I would like to meet Francis Lee, who was thinking of taking over the club. I said ‘of course’; he was one of my childhood heroes. I met Francis and gave him quite a bit of financial advice, which he didn’t altogether take.”</p>\n<p>Lee went ahead with his takeover but found he had gone in under-capitalised and was under pressure immediately. He invited Bernstein to join the board. Far from the petrodollar-funded European powerhouse it is today, Bernstein found a club in financial disrepair. Despite their best efforts, City lurched from crisis to relegation battle. The director and shareholders approached Bernstein and asked if he would replace Lee as chairman, “which was not easy as we had been very close. I had to go to his house with another director on a Saturday morning – I’ll never forget it – and tell him his time was up, he had to go. I don’t quite know how we did it but by Sunday night it was all signed and sealed.” He also admits that their relationship subsequently became a “little bit distant”.</p>\n<p>“On the Monday morning I came to Maine Road and I noticed quite a lot of media. I said to our press officer: ‘I think I’d like to handle the media on a one-to-one basis.’ He said: ‘You must be joking, there’s 100 of them out there.’ So I swallowed hard, went out, and it’s amazing what you can do when you have to.”</p>\n<p>A period of success followed that included persuading recent England manager Kevin Keegan to take the reins, and the club “never looked back”. Bernstein negotiated the lease for a new, blue, modern stadium — “very much my deal” — which would eventually entice Abu Dhabi royalty to buy the club.</p>\n<p>He left in March 2003 after falling out with the board over transfers. He says it was “on matters of principle. I felt members of the board were being seduced into doing rash deals. That tightness, that togetherness we had began to dissipate.”</p>\n<p>He joined the board of Wembley Stadium Ltd, eventually becoming chairman, overseeing the construction of the new national stadium following many financial teething problems. Then came his biggest role to date, that of FA chairman.</p>\n<p>Bernstein recalls: “2010 was a really difficult year for the FA. The chief executive resigned, the chairman [Lord Triesman] had to go very suddenly for saying things rather unwisely. We had the World Cup debacle and the World Cup bid debacle and on the basis of all that I thought, well, why don’t I have a go?”</p>\n\n<div class=\"\"><div class=\"hide gallery\">\n<ul><li>239f5964b2891deda73f06d37fe9c402</li><li>bb795744cb497131044bdce33ac4d187</li></ul>\n</div></div><p>The role has been viewed as something of a poisoned chalice, due to constant media scrutiny, and the constructing power of a self-governing body that has been slow to evolve. So did he hesitate in taking it? “Not really. I knew a lot about it. I knew the people. I’d run a Premier League club so I thought I was well qualified to do it. I quite like being put in those difficult situations. But I must say that the amount of exposure and the things you have to do were probably greater than I imagined.”</p>\n<p>Following the Terry incident, the issue of respect, both on and off the field, became central to his leadership. He was asked by David Cameron to head a review of the issues in football. “And we did get the whole of football together on this,” he says. “We signed off a report with nearly 100 recommendations, which I hope are being implemented.”</p>\n<p>Again unafraid to make the bold decision, a team headed by Bernstein ignored the media-anointed Harry Redknapp and appointed the more cerebral, but less popular, Roy Hodgson as England manager. Bernstein describes him as: “a particularly civilised guy, well read, intelligent, you can talk to him. We’ve remained friendly, which doesn’t always happen in football.”</p>\n<p>He looks back on his time at the FA with pride but no little frustration. “As a fairly reformist chairman and with the government behind us, I thought we could make real progress. In fact, we made some. It got bogged down because there’s a strong reluctance for radical change. It’s like many of these representative self-governing bodies – to get them to change voluntarily is incredibly difficult. It really needs sizable outside pressure from the government or somewhere else.” Despite being out of the game, it’s clear Bernstein is still passionate about the development of the UK’s favourite sport, and the role of the FA in shaping it. His successor Greg Dyke scored an own goal with his first major move as chairman: the recent England Commission report which outlined a radical restructuring of English football, headed by the much-derided “B teams” proposal. It suggested creating a new tier between the non-league conference and professional League Two made up of 10 Premier League B teams and 10 Conference sides, from 2016-17.</p>\n<p>“A very silly idea,” says Bernstein. “I don’t think it’s workable. I can see so many problems with it, I’m surprised it ever got on to the table. One of the glories of our game is the breadth of it, the league system, the 92 clubs and the pyramid below it.</p>\n<p>“The FA said there are 300,000 volunteers in the bottom tiers. It does a wonderful job in the community and to break that up for this end is just silly. I don’t think it will happen. Some of the questions that have been asked and have not been answered – it really doesn’t bear too much discussion.</p>\n<p>“The mistake was having that at the forefront, as it seems to have undermined everything else. I’m not involved now and it’s very easy to be critical from the outside, and I’m trying to stay out of that,” he adds.</p>\n<p>As the sums of money flowing into the game, and particularly the English Premier League, become ever more inflated and the worlds of football and finance continue to intertwine, few are better placed to assess the state of football finance. While concerned at the amount of money being spent by clubs, Bernstein is ambivalent over the consequences of Financial Fair Play, the set of regulations designed by European governing body UEFA to stop reckless spending on wages and transfer fees, and curb large cash injections from rich club owners.</p>\n<p>He worries that though its intentions are sound, it will only serve to maintain the status quo among the very elite of the European game. “I’m in two minds about it. I’m all for financial responsibility and keeping things in balance but in a way it reduces the romance of the game, the dream of the game.”</p>\n<p>But he has no such doubts over the importance of the ACA in preparing him for a career as varied as it has been successful.   “It’s a wonderful qualification. The fact that it makes you financially aware and financially numerate is tremendous. The training is great in the sense that it enables you to switch from one thing to another very quickly: in practice, from one client to another. It’s a great opener, a great doorway. I’m grateful I went down that route and very proud of ICAEW and all it represents.”</p>\n<p>He is now chairman of the British Red Cross, another national institution with a strong grassroots base embedded deeply in British society. Keen to get back on to the board of a major organisation, in particular in the voluntary sector, he didn’t hesitate when headhunted for the role. He speaks with pride about the work the organisation does at home and abroad, and those who devote their time to helping others.</p>\n<p>His excitement is genuine when discussing the Red Cross and what it can achieve and, when he assures me he has “plenty going on” to fill the days, I believe him. The natural consequence of his career is a contacts book the envy of most in the City, football industry, and even Westminster. But what if that offer to get back in the game were to come along?</p>\n<p>“We’ll see about football. You never know what’s round the corner or when the phone’s going to ring. Once you’re involved in football it is very enticing, it can get very frustrating, but it’s a great industry. It would have to be the right situation. I’ve been very lucky so I wouldn’t want a damp squib.”</p>\n<p>If the beautiful game calls him back, he shouldn’t be short of offers. After all, what club doesn’t need a safe pair of hands?</p>\n<div class=\"am_info_box\">\n\t<fieldset>\n\t<legend><div>CAREER HIGHLIGHTS</div></legend>\n\t<div class=\"text\"><p><b>1966</b>  Qualifies with Robson Rhodes</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>1967 </b> Joins Hacker Young</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>1968</b> Moves to Bright Grahame Murray where he makes partner at 25</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>1988</b>  Named joint chief executive of Pentland Group</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>1997</b>  Joins French Connection</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>1998</b>  Replaces Francis Lee as Manchester City chairman</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>2003</b> Appointed to board of Wembley Stadium</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>2010</b>  Made FA chairman</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>2013</b>  Appointed chairman of the British Red Cross</p>\n</div>\n\t</fieldset>\n</div>","layout":{"landscape":{"id":"am-dp1-layout9","link":"story-landscape-layout5.html"},"portrait":{"id":"am-dp1-layout10","link":"story-portrait-layout5.html"}},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":"","link_source":"","image":[{"id":"6f0bfbd8bf6f9cec06ed7979df1913ed","name":"David Bernstein1","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com/var/economia/storage/images/david-bernstein12/56180-1-eng-GB/david-bernstein1_story_img_size_768x929.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"768","height":"931","is_default":true},{"id":"6f0bfbd8bf6f9cec06ed7979df1913ed","name":"David Bernstein1","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com/var/economia/storage/images/david-bernstein12/56180-1-eng-GB/david-bernstein1_story_img_size_1024x673.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"1025","height":"673","is_default":false}],"related_objects":{"gallery":[[{"id":"239f5964b2891deda73f06d37fe9c402","name":"David Bernstein3","source":"","caption":"<p>Meeting the teams before a men's international, with then skipper John Terry (in blue) looking on</p>\n","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com/var/economia/storage/images/david-bernstein3/56192-1-eng-GB/david-bernstein3_default_ipad_portrait.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"768","height":"453"},{"id":"239f5964b2891deda73f06d37fe9c402","name":"David Bernstein3","source":"","caption":"<p>Meeting the teams before a men's international, with then skipper John Terry (in blue) looking on</p>\n","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com/var/economia/storage/images/david-bernstein3/56192-1-eng-GB/david-bernstein3_default_ipad_landscape.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"1024","height":"604"},{"id":"bb795744cb497131044bdce33ac4d187","name":"David Bernstein2","source":"","caption":"<p>With David Cameron, former England women's boss Hope Powell and staff and members of England Women</p>\n","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com/var/economia/storage/images/david-bernstein2/56199-1-eng-GB/david-bernstein2_default_ipad_portrait.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"768","height":"512"},{"id":"bb795744cb497131044bdce33ac4d187","name":"David Bernstein2","source":"","caption":"<p>With David Cameron, former England women's boss Hope Powell and staff and members of England Women</p>\n","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com/var/economia/storage/images/david-bernstein2/56199-1-eng-GB/david-bernstein2_default_ipad_landscape.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"1024","height":"682"}]]},"url_alias":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com","type":"story","order":"16","folio_number":"0","folio_numbers":"","pdf_page_index":"0","thumbnail":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com/var/economia/storage/images/david-bernstein12/56180-1-eng-GB/david-bernstein1_tablet_story_thumbnail.jpg","color":"e9ae00","real_id":"6067","main_section_id":"661","ads":[]},{"id":"c10b937569fdf1c27ea275e01ab5ec51","title":"More than one way to skin a bear","sub_title":"","author":[{"id":"0","name":"Emily Black","email":"emily.black@progressivecp.com","is_default":false}],"tag":"","strap_line":"Sanctioning Russia","short_intro":"Putting pressure on Russia","intro":"Russia’s incursion into Ukraine has led to sanctions from the US and Europe. But are there more effective ways to pressurise Putin? Christopher Alkan reports","body":"<p class=\"dropcap\">To drive away a bear you need more than a rolled-up newspaper. On the surface, this appears to be what the United States and Europe are attempting to use with a series of puny sanctions against Russia following its annexation of Crimea. Blacklisting a coterie of plutocrats and officials is no way to intimidate a nation with the world’s seventh largest economy, sceptics have argued.</p>\n<p>What’s more, Russia enjoys vast oil revenues as the world’s second largest exporter of crude, shipping at least three times more than Iran at its peak. The nation also accounts for a third of Europe’s gas imports, making it hard to push around. Yet Russia may be deceptively vulnerable.</p>\n<p>“Russia is in no shape to withstand an economic siege,” says Anders Aslund, a former adviser to the Kremlin and now a fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. “Not only has the country been badly mismanaged, it is also extremely reliant on the international financial system. The upshot is that carefully designed sanctions have the ability to inflict massive economic harm on Russia.”</p>\n<p>Even the mild slap administered by the US and Europe has been sufficient to send $50bn (£30bn) of capital fleeing from the country in the first months of 2014. And Russia’s economics ministry has slashed its growth forecast from 2.5% to just 1%. Without a diplomatic détente, the outlook may get even grimmer.</p>\n<p>When President Vladimir Putin decided to annex Crimea, it is likely that politics rather than economics were at the forefront of his mind. This demonstration of Russian machismo has been doing wonders for his approval rating, driving it up to 72% from last year’s 62%, according to VTsIOM, the All-Russian Center for the Study of Public Opinion.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the region itself is likely to prove an economic burden. Crimea is poor, with a GDP per capita on a par with the least developed areas of Russia, such as the turbulent Chechnya. It produces just one tenth of the energy it consumes and was heavily dependent on the central government of Ukraine for finance. This helps explain why the Kremlin has already earmarked $7bn (£4bn) in economic aid for the peninsula this year. The money will be spent on infrastructure and beefed up pensions for local residents.</p>\n<p>Such burdens pale, however, compared to the possible economic fallout from well-targeted sanctions. If the crisis escalates, the World Bank believes that the Russian economy could contract by nearly 2% in 2014 – a loss of around $30bn (£18bn) in output. Former Russian finance minister Alexei Kudrin has said the Ukraine crisis could lead to $160bn (£96bn) of capital outflow this year, enough for the economy to stagnate.</p>\n<p>The trick will be to ensure that sanctions inflict maximum damage on Russia while minimising the risk of harm to the US or the rest of Europe. That rules out certain obvious ways of punishing Putin.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"right\" ><span class=\"hide\">\"</span><p>“Putin has been a lazy manager of Russia – relying on high oil prices  while allowing the underlying structure to disintegrate”</p>\n<span class=\"hide\">\"</span></blockquote>\n<p>A boycott of Russian gas and oil might bring the country to heel. But the cost to rich nations would be immense. “The world was able to live without Iran’s 2.2m barrels of oil a day,” says Tom Biracree, an energy analyst at consultancy IHS. “Cutting off Russia’s 7.7m barrels a day of exports would send fuel prices soaring across the globe.” What is more, an embargo on Russian oil could never be complete. “If an embargo pushed up global prices, Russia would merely sell less oil but get a higher price per barrel. It wouldn’t suffer any net fall in income,” says Biracree.</p>\n<p>Even a more limited ban on purchases of Russian gas is economically unthinkable for Europe. A third of Europe’s gas imports come from Russia. “Stop the flow and electricity prices in Europe would jump dramatically,” Biracree adds. “This would have a chilling effect on the zone’s economy.”</p>\n<h2>A MORE SUBTLE APPROACH</h2><p>None of this means that Russia’s energy sector can’t be touched. As the source of half of government revenue in 2012 and about 70% of export earnings, it is an obvious target. And there are ways that more subtle sanctions could undermine Russia’s hydrocarbon industry over the long term. Russian energy firms are less technologically sophisticated than their big western rivals, such as Royal Dutch Shell or Exxon Mobil, and have less ready access to capital. That makes foreign participation crucial to keeping the industry in good health.</p>\n<p>“Many of the nation’s oil fields are now very old and so even keeping production stable will be a struggle,” says Adnan Vatansever, a senior lecturer on energy at King’s College London. “That will require raising a lot of money and also attracting plenty of foreign investment. Both will be far harder   if Russia becomes an international pariah.”</p>\n<p>Even the relatively mild sanctions could prove a problem for the Russian energy sector. Igor Sechin, the chief executive of Russia’s largest oil producer Rosneft, was among those targeted by US sanctions. The company has worked with America’s Exxon Mobil to develop Russian reserves in the Arctic. But such deals with foreign oil firms may be harder to negotiate if diplomatic tensions remain high. That would slow the development of the nation’s reserves.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Russia’s sales of gas are being put at risk. “There is not much that Europe can do in the short term to reduce reliance on Russian gas,” says Vatansever. “Still, energy ministers have already started to consider alternatives – including liquefied natural gas from the US, where supplies are abundant.” Since gas sales to Europe account for 14% of Russia’s export earnings, this is not a threat Putin’s government can afford to take lightly.</p>\n<p>Potentially sanctions could go further by banning large oil service companies, such as Halliburton and Schlumberger, from lending their expertise to Russia, says Vatansever. “Over the long term, this would undermine Russia’s oil and gas output.”</p>\n<h2>ENCOURAGEMENT TO COMPROMISE</h2><p>An even more effective way of deterring Russia without harming the global economy may be through financial sanctions, argues Juan Zarate, author of Treasury’s War: The Unleashing of a New Era of Financial Warfare. There is good evidence that clamping down on banks and freezing assets has helped restrain other bellicose nations, he says. Freezing North Korea’s assets in a Macau bank in 2005 encouraged the nation to return to the negotiating table. Meanwhile, targeting banks and firms with connections to Iran’s Revolutionary Guard also appears to have made the country more amenable to compromise.</p>\n<p>This approach could be even more powerful with Russia. “The nation is extremely reliant on the global financial system,” says Aslund. “If Russian businesses want loans or to raise money in equity markets, they tend to do so abroad. The reason is that they do not trust the legal system at home to protect their property rights or enforce contracts.” About 70 Russian companies are listed in London, for example.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, a World Bank report recently showed that Russia had $732bn (£437bn) in foreign debt. That included almost $300bn (£179bn) owed by state-controlled banks and other government-owned companies. “If sanctions are extended it could be hard to renew these loans, causing considerable financial disruption,” says Aslund. In an extreme case, experts believe that sanctions could cause a “Lehman-like” financial meltdown in Russia.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\"><div class=\"hide gallery\">\n<ul><li>3b038932d03a13f39fcb3d3ed45aeb23</li><li>f409263a56060957f45f10982e0bff63</li></ul>\n</div></div><p>Again, Zarate believes that a subtle approach is best. He says simply freezing the assets of individuals or banks without cause would be legally dubious – resulting in endless court actions. “Much the same effect can be achieved through conduct-based financial isolation,” he says. “This would entail really aggressive investigations into the money laundering, corruption and tax evasion by Russian individuals or banks.”</p>\n<p>The US Treasury has already started to experiment with this approach. On 8 May, the US imposed sanctions on Moscow-based Tempbank for allegedly financing arms shipments to the Syrian regime of Bashar al-Assad.</p>\n<p>The advantage of this tactic is that it is easier to secure collaboration from financial institutions and avoid legal problems. “All global banks have mechanisms set up to deal with these kinds of illicit activity,” Zarate says. “None want to take the risk of having their reputations tarnished.”</p>\n<p>The other merit of this approach, Zarate says, is that it is extremely flexible. In an ideal world the authorities would always be aggressively pursuing such wrongdoing. In reality, the US can ratchet up or down such policing actions very quickly.  “If Russia starts to behave better, it is easy to call off the dogs,” Zarate points out. The international role of the dollar provides the US with another trump card. Sanctions against Bank Rossiya, the first bank to be sanctioned, ensured that it could no longer engage in foreign exchange operations – a crippling blow. Although Rossiya is not a significant financial institution, it gave Russia a hint of the damage that could be inflicted if a major bank were shut out of the dollar-based global system.</p>\n<h2>UNDERLYING ECONOMIC WEAKNESS</h2><p>Any nation would be susceptible to such measures. But Russia’s economy was fragile even before the Crimean crisis, says Neil Shearing, the chief emerging markets economist at consultancy Capital Economics. Economic growth has slumped from a peak of 9% in 2007 when Russia was seen as a promising BRIC nation, to just 1.3% in 2009. “Putin has been a lazy manager of Russia – relying on high oil prices to get by while allowing the underlying structure of the economy to disintegrate,” Shearing says.</p>\n<p>For a start, Russia has permitted its oil and gas bounty to displace other manufacturing – a phenomenon known as the Dutch disease. Over the past decade the nation’s effective exchange rate has climbed by around 60%, largely the result of strong crude revenues, according to Capital Economics. That has made it harder for other industries to sell their wares overseas. The result is that manufacturing now accounts for just 13% of GDP, down from nearly 16% in 2004. “This is storing up problems for the future, especially if oil prices fall,” says Shearing. “High oil prices are now a necessity and not a luxury for Russia.”</p>\n<p>Other flaws in Russia’s economy make it unusually reliant on outside investment and expertise. Aside from hydrocarbons, the nation has few strengths. “Growth has been constrained by Russia’s large number of inefficient companies – often the legacy of Communism,” says Shearing. “Much of the industrial capacity was built during Soviet times and is now outdated.” The nation is dotted with “mono-towns” – towns reliant on a single factory that is often loss making and supported by government subsidies. To stand any hope of turning this around, Russia will need the collaboration of foreign companies and investors.</p>\n<p>Russia has also been suffering from a brain drain. “The nation is experiencing a shortage of highly-skilled professionals,” says Shearing. A recent report by human resources firm Antal Russia concluded that nearly 90% of companies were struggling to find high-skilled workers.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"right\" ><span class=\"hide\">\"</span><p>Sanctions against Bank Rossiya showed Russia the damage that could be inflicted if a major bank were shut out of the dollar-based global system</p>\n<span class=\"hide\">\"</span></blockquote>\n<p>These limitations mean that even before the crisis over Ukraine, Russia was on track to grow by just 2% or 2.5% a year, according to Capital Economics, an extremely slow rate for an emerging nation. “Russia would now be far less vulnerable had Putin spent years reforming the Russian economy, cutting red tape, trimming state subsidies, and ensuring that Russian businesses were able to raise capital at home,” says Shearing. “As things stand, however, Russia would pay a heavy price for even a brief period of economic isolation.”</p>\n<p>Of course, punishing Russia is not without costs for the US and Europe. In recent years the nation had cooperated in the campaign to put financial pressure on Iran. Aside from withdrawing such support, Russia could deploy more covert tools. The Kremlin has used cyber attacks against Georgia and may be willing to enlist hackers to damage western companies or governments.</p>\n<p>That said, it is very unlikely that Russia will use its big energy weapon – cutting off gas or oil supplies. “This would be the economic equivalent of the nuclear bomb,” says Aslund.</p>\n<p>Russia is by far the most formidable nation to be targeted by US sanctions since the end of the Cold War in the 1990s. Yet such measures are not necessary to bring Russia to its knees, says Zarate. “Sanctions merely need to show Putin and his coterie that the financial costs of territorial aggression outweigh the political benefits,” he argues. “Carefully-designed measures are more than able to do this.”</p>\n<p>In the short term, Putin’s popularity has climbed as a result of his muscular foreign policy. This would most likely shift, however, after several years of sluggish economic growth or recession. Even if the population at large continued to back the macho president, the oligarchs that surround him have become increasingly international – aspiring to create global companies. If they start to feel that Putin has become a liability, the president’s days would be numbered.</p>\n","layout":{"landscape":{"id":"am-dp1-layout15","link":"story-landscape-layout8.html"},"portrait":{"id":"am-dp1-layout16","link":"story-portrait-layout8.html"}},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":"","link_source":"","image":[{"id":"c605a34381a6eb2e04814675aa02bf52","name":"Russia1","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com/var/economia/storage/images/russia13/56924-1-eng-GB/russia1_story_img_size_768x929.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"768","height":"929","is_default":true},{"id":"c605a34381a6eb2e04814675aa02bf52","name":"Russia1","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com/var/economia/storage/images/russia13/56924-1-eng-GB/russia1_story_img_size_1024x673.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"1024","height":"673","is_default":false}],"related_objects":{"gallery":[[{"id":"3b038932d03a13f39fcb3d3ed45aeb23","name":"Russia2","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com/var/economia/storage/images/russia22/56936-1-eng-GB/russia2_default_ipad_portrait.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"768","height":"497"},{"id":"3b038932d03a13f39fcb3d3ed45aeb23","name":"Russia2","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com/var/economia/storage/images/russia22/56936-1-eng-GB/russia2_default_ipad_landscape.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"1024","height":"662"},{"id":"f409263a56060957f45f10982e0bff63","name":"Russia3","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com/var/economia/storage/images/russia32/56943-1-eng-GB/russia3_default_ipad_portrait.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"735","height":"1024"},{"id":"f409263a56060957f45f10982e0bff63","name":"Russia3","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com/var/economia/storage/images/russia32/56943-1-eng-GB/russia3_default_ipad_landscape.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"551","height":"768"}]]},"url_alias":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com","type":"story","order":"17","folio_number":"0","folio_numbers":"","pdf_page_index":"0","thumbnail":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com/var/economia/storage/images/russia13/56924-1-eng-GB/russia1_tablet_story_thumbnail.jpg","color":"e9ae00","real_id":"6069","main_section_id":"661","ads":[]},{"id":"09ceeba976568836ce24ff95c2280659","title":"A force for good","sub_title":"","author":[{"id":"0","name":"Emily Black","email":"emily.black@progressivecp.com","is_default":false}],"tag":"","strap_line":"Sponsored feature: Baird Capital","short_intro":"","intro":"Over the past 20 years, the face of private equity has undergone a major transformation. At a recent roundtable hosted by Baird Capital, business leaders from across the sector debated the changing face of private equity, and how far it can go to helping SMEs expand today","body":"<div class=\"am_info_box\">\n\t<fieldset>\n\t<legend><div>Attendees</div></legend>\n\t<div class=\"text\"><p><b>Jon Bernstein </b>Facilitator </p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>Andrew Ferguson</b> Managing director, Baird Capital</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>Dennis Hall</b> Managing director portfolio operations, Baird Capital</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>Ken Lindsay</b> Partner, ECI</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>Adrian Yurkwich</b> Partner, Silverfleet Capital</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>Tim Trotter</b> Independent chairman</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>Paul Carter</b> Independent chairman</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>James Pitt</b> Partner, Lexington Partners</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>John D’Arcy</b> Associate director, Newton Europe</p>\n</div>\n\t</fieldset>\n</div><p><b>Andrew Ferguson:</b> We see a  lot of headlines of a negative nature about private equity, focussing on big buy-outs, fat cats and asset stripping, which is not a world I recognise in mid-market private equity today.</p>\n<p>Twenty years ago we were stock picking, we put in a bit of corporate governance, and hoped we’d got the right business and management team. Debt was cheap and a lot of the models were based around deleveraging and maybe less so on strategic planning. Today, there’s much more involvement in the businesses we invest in, a lot more thinking about the path to value, international growth, and operational improvement. For many SMEs, private equity can be a force for good.</p>\n<p><b>Tim Trotter:</b> Now, there’s a focus on how to support and develop the management team. Those who work in private equity have had a lot of experience in spotting strengths and weaknesses in management and know how to mentor and manage talent. When it comes to product development, innovation, and business development, private equity can offer contacts and experience, which can save a lot of time.</p>\n<p><b>Jon Bernstein:</b><i>Many of these companies have been in the family for generations. It must be complicated telling someone that they need a stranger they’ve never met before telling them how to run their business.</i></p>\n<p><b>Paul Carter:</b> It is hard and you do have to part company with the people who are holding things back. But you have to remember that the reason for involving private equity is to take the business forward for the benefit of everyone else involved.  Not only does private equity bring good financial management, but having someone with industry experience in a chairman or non-exec role brings insight and consultancy that can deliver a better bottom line.</p>\n<p><b>John D’Arcy:</b> That experience is reflected in the make-up of private equity houses these days. Whereas they used to be 100% accountants, we now see people with operational experience as well and that’s important. While typically, 10 years ago, everyone seemed happy with the idea of leveraging up and floating upwards with the market, now there’s a genuine belief that there is value to be created within the guts of the operation. So it’s not just about mentoring at the top, it’s also about getting the most out of the middle and bottom of an organisation.</p>\n<p><b>Adrian Yurkwich:</b> These days   it is possible to do that. Before we’ve even made the investment we have a pretty clear strategy. It’s about buying and building – investing in new products, technologies and geographies – over a three- to seven- year period. Private equity is often accused of being short-termist but we are more long term than the City which looks at things quarterly.</p>\n<p><b>Jon Bernstein:</b><i>The perception is that you’re building it for exit, and whether it’s sustainable is of less interest.</i></p>\n<blockquote class=\"right\" ><span class=\"hide\">\"</span><p>“If I look at the vast majority of businesses that private equity gets involved with, there’s an increase in R&amp;D, employment and investment”</p>\n<p><b>Dennis Hall</b></p>\n<span class=\"hide\">\"</span></blockquote>\n<p><b>Adrian Yurkwich:</b> It is being built for exit, but it is also sustainable. No sophisticated buyer will pay a good price for the business if they don’t believe that in the next five years it will be even more successful. </p>\n<p><b>Andrew Ferguson:</b> The problem is that the press love bad stories. Debenhams is always used as a cautionary tale. [In 2003 various private equity houses invested £600m to acquire Debenhams. They trebled their investment in three years after cutting costs and selling off freehold property, leaving the company with £1bn of debt and plummeting shares.] That’s one example of potentially bad practice held up as a reason for mistrusting private equity as a whole.</p>\n<p><b>Dennis Hall:</b> If I look at the vast majority of businesses that private equity get involved with, there’s an increase in R&amp;D, employment and investment. The problem is that it doesn’t make a good story. The fact that we create jobs goes unnoticed.</p>\n<p><b>Jon Bernstein:</b><i>Is it that the jobs that are being created are being created out East and actually you’re losing jobs in domestic markets?</i></p>\n<p><b>Adrian Yurkwich:</b> Not always. You have private equity firms that are interested in growing and building business, but you do also have distress funds and turnaround funds. They take over very distressed businesses and, to make them profitable, have to make difficult decisions. Sometimes doing the right thing for the business can mean job losses.</p>\n<p><b>Paul Carter:</b> There’s very strong evidence to suggest that the drive to get offshore is fine if you have significant manufacturing regularly taking place, and it’s got good volumes – they can set up and become good at it. But if you’ve got a lot of volatility, engineering change, and very short lead-times, those markets are not geared up for that.</p>\n<p><b>Andrew Ferguson:</b> That said, the ability to access the Far East from an SME perspective is a lot harder.  As an SME making a couple of million pounds a year, it is much more difficult to find quality suppliers from the Far East.</p>\n<p><b>Dennis Hall:</b> That’s where private equity can help. A small business in the West Midlands may not have that expertise, but a private equity house might. The other part of the equation comes when these businesses are looking to grow and internationalise.</p>\n<p><b>Jon Bernstein:</b><i>We’ve talked about SMEs as a single group but in the US in the private equity arena, there’s talk of sectorisation…</i></p>\n<p><b>James Pitt:</b> We routinely come across firms in the US that specialise only in retail, or software, or media, and there are plenty of them, but that’s less likely to happen in the UK.</p>\n<p><b>Andrew Ferguson:</b> At Baird, we focus on three large areas: manufactured products, B2B services and healthcare. They’re pretty broad, but we did that because we felt that, over decades, you build knowledge, experience and contacts. We feel if we know our sectors better, we can better invest our investors’ money.</p>\n<p><b>Jon Bernstein:</b><i>So what will mid-market private equity look like in 10 years’ time?</i></p>\n<p><b>Adrian Yurkwich:</b> I don’t see it changing hugely. Over the last 20 years, the market has become more competitive, so private equity has had to up its game. Now, it has to work closer and harder with the company to deliver growth, it can’t rely on a macro high level of growth to turbocharge the top line.</p>\n<p><b>Andrew Ferguson:</b> Evolution doesn’t happen quickly. In 10 years, firms may be more international, perhaps more sector-focused, perhaps with more operational people. We will have to find increasingly sophisticated ways of building value in our portfolio companies in the years ahead.</p>\n<p><b>James Pitt:</b> Beyond that I think we’re going to see changes to the industry structure. It’s quite a mobile industry. And the logical outflow of these comments about increased competition, sophistication and necessity to add value means that  for the vendor, selling prices could  be higher.</p>\n<p><b>Dennis Hall:</b> Ten years ago most people round a dinner table wouldn’t have heard of private equity but now one in five people in the UK work or have worked for a private equity- backed business. It’s a major driver  of UK growth and I think that’s going to continue.</p>\n","layout":{"landscape":{"id":"am-dp1-layout7","link":"story-landscape-layout4.html"},"portrait":{"id":"am-dp1-layout8","link":"story-portrait-layout4.html"}},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":"","link_source":"","image":[{"id":"39178c83dac996898e503153a2259bfb","name":"Baird3","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com/var/economia/storage/images/baird33/56583-1-eng-GB/baird3_story_img_size_768x929.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"768","height":"929","is_default":true},{"id":"39178c83dac996898e503153a2259bfb","name":"Baird3","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com/var/economia/storage/images/baird33/56583-1-eng-GB/baird3_story_img_size_1024x673.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"1024","height":"673","is_default":false}],"url_alias":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com","type":"story","order":"18","folio_number":"0","folio_numbers":"","pdf_page_index":"0","thumbnail":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com/var/economia/storage/images/baird33/56583-1-eng-GB/baird3_tablet_story_thumbnail.jpg","color":"e9ae00","real_id":"6071","main_section_id":"661","ads":[]},{"id":"511ec86ee8af7b552eb9ebc24a002073","title":"Is social media a waste of time for business?","sub_title":"","author":[{"id":"0","name":"Emily Black","email":"emily.black@progressivecp.com","is_default":false}],"tag":"","strap_line":"Debate: Social media","short_intro":"","intro":"","body":"<h2><b>YES</b> <i>Robert Wynne</i> president, Wynne Communications</h2><p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>NO <i>Molly Flatt </i>writer, word of mouth evangelist for 1000heads and digital editor of PHOENIX Magazine</h2><p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><b>YES</b> ROBERT WYNNE</h2><p>Look at your audience. Who is primarily on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter? Children, teenagers, celebrities and families. What is it you want to say? Probably something important about taxes, a new hire, a new law that impacts your clients, or possibly a new office. Now post it on Facebook, right next to photos of that cute kitty. “Watch out, he’s about to knock over that aquarium. What a scamp. Now what were you saying about your firm?” It doesn’t look appropriate next to that cat, does it?</p>\n<p>Some things do well on social media: celebrities who appeal to teenagers, such as Justin Bieber and Miley Cyrus. Games including Candy Crush. But not businesses or accountancy firms. If you post your news item on social media, then send it out via a news release service or to your client list: which do you think will be more successful?</p>\n<p>Social media is about conversation and most of that, unfortunately, involves reposting. Financial results, tax advice, new hires; most of that is best posted on your website, your blog or sent directly. The best way to reach your clients, friends and influencers is via email. As Rick Newman, chief business correspondent for the US News &amp; World Report put it: “Social media represents all these new forms of information, but all roads lead to email.”</p>\n<h2><b>NO</b> MOLLY FLATT</h2><p>Saying social media is a waste of time for business is like saying humans are a waste of time for business. Social media is simply a set of tools that allow people to connect with each other. Sometimes we use social media to gossip or watch videos of cats, just like we sometimes eat junk food. But most of us also cook nutritious meals, and we use social tools to do things that are central to our lives and to businesses: for example, asking others for advice, giving recommendations or collaborating with others. And by “we” I mean everyone.</p>\n<p>Pew Research tells us that 71% of online adults now use Facebook, including 45% of internet users aged 65 and over. The Interactive Advertising Bureau tells us 90% of consumers would recommend a brand to others after interacting with them on social media. Frankly, if you think that connecting with your clients involves talking about taxes or telling them who you just hired, you’ve got a problem.   This is about emotion, not just information. Emotion is what drives people to buy products, remain loyal  or spread the word, and emotion is the currency of social media.</p>\n<h2>ROBERT WYNNE</h2><p>Yes, more people are using social media than ever. But are they using it to discover the offerings of a company, to compare prices, to contact customer service or to engage with businesses? Not really.</p>\n<p>Look at your own habits. If you have a problem with your Samsung 55-in LED TV, do you check Facebook and Twitter or do you go to the retailer’s website? If you have an American Express Platinum card and want to buy tickets for Adele’s concert using the credit card firm concierge to get the best seats, do you look at social media or “like” a page about Adele on Facebook? Neither – you look at their website.</p>\n<p>The same principles apply to accountancy firms. If you need to contact your clients about a change in tax policy, a direct email or notice on your website homepage will be more effective and professional. The same applies when it comes to crises. Twitter may seem to be the best platform to inform the masses but it only works when you lead clients to a live person or team of experts via email or phone.</p>\n<p>It’s comforting to believe that all businesses need to do is type in a few words or post an arresting photo and the magic happens. But perhaps it’s better to think of social media as a complementary function that leads people to where they really want to go: to your website or to a live human at your practice. That’s what you want as a customer, isn’t it? So treat your clients with the same respect and efficiency.</p>\n<h2>MOLLY FLATT</h2><p>Using your own habits to extrapolate what the rest of the world is doing is a classic marketer’s mistake. Let us consider the facts. Research from the Ambassador Group shows that 9% of all social media users engage with brands daily, more than half will do so several times a month, and 33% of people would rather contact a company by social media than by telephone. And this behaviour is increasing.</p>\n<p>The Center for Marketing Research in the US recently found that 62% of Millennials like at least one brand on Facebook, 23% follow a brand on Twitter and 11% have pinned a brand on Pinterest. Their top three motivations? Supporting that brand, getting brand news and updates, and discovering discounts.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"right\" ><span class=\"hide\">\"</span><p>&quot;The best brands spend more time listing on social media than they do talking.&quot;</p>\n<span class=\"hide\">\"</span></blockquote>\n<p>But although the value of social media for brands – as a channel for broadcast, transaction and customer service – is valuable, it still misses the point. Getting people to talk to each other about you as a brand, rather than talking to them, is where social’s power lies. The best brands spend more time listening on social media than they do talking – and then use that insight to surprise customers or clients.</p>\n<p>Take the Samsung example: a savvy competitor could spot that person tweeting about their broken TV and offer them a free trial of their product instead. Or with the American Express example, why not give bloggers early access to your top events, encouraging recommendations with greater reach, trust and relevance than your concierge will ever have?</p>\n<p>You can’t just plonk the same old business approaches onto social media. You have to change what you do. And that means prioritising advocacy, not just functionality.</p>\n<h2>ROBERT WYNNE</h2><p>There are great statistics about the rate of people using and enjoying social media, but it’s difficult to find anecdotes about serious businesses actually profiting from social media compared with good websites, their own blogs, and other effective digital communications including email. The example about another TV company bottom fishing by trying to pick up dissatisfied customers illustrates a reactive strategy for followers, not leaders. </p>\n<p>Think of social media as another outlet for posting news, stories, anecdotes and hope it brings customers, friends and other audiences to your website or even better, to call or email you directly. I’ve seen marketers spend hundreds of thousands of dollars building up Twitter followers and Facebook likes with nothing to show for it but... followers and likes.</p>\n<p>There’s a role for social media, as part of an overall public relations, marketing, advertising and communications plan. There are apps used today by Forbes contributors, including myself, that allow us to post our columns to several social media sites simultaneously. Soon anyone will be able to do that. And once the sites and messages can be aggregated, they will seem less unique and just one more hammer or screwdriver in the toolbox.</p>\n<h2>MOLLY FLATT</h2><p>Social media is not a better or worse version of brand websites or emails. It is a totally different beast, requiring a totally different set of approaches and skills. Businesses are followers, not leaders, in this space. In social media, you need to listen to your consumers or clients, then serve them in the most helpful, timely, relevant and inspiring ways – not try to dictate your superior wisdom or pre-packaged marketing bumf.</p>\n<p>Of course, social media can’t fulfil every business role. But it is a way to build genuine and mutually rewarding relationships with your customers. So do keep auto-publishing your fascinating Forbes columns and sending them round via email. That way the rest of us can happily ignore them – and spend time engaging with businesses who approach this space like human beings, not content-creating robots.</p>\n","layout":{"landscape":{"id":"am-dp1-layout9","link":"story-landscape-layout5.html"},"portrait":{"id":"am-dp1-layout10","link":"story-portrait-layout5.html"}},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":"","link_source":"","image":[{"id":"53d4a3271657208a45dbd056a12b4dc3","name":"Debate","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com/var/economia/storage/images/debate8/56562-1-eng-GB/debate_story_img_size_768x929.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"768","height":"929","is_default":true},{"id":"53d4a3271657208a45dbd056a12b4dc3","name":"Debate","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com/var/economia/storage/images/debate8/56562-1-eng-GB/debate_story_img_size_1024x673.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"1024","height":"673","is_default":false}],"url_alias":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com","type":"story","order":"19","folio_number":"0","folio_numbers":"","pdf_page_index":"0","thumbnail":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com/var/economia/storage/images/debate8/56562-1-eng-GB/debate_tablet_story_thumbnail.jpg","color":"e9ae00","real_id":"6073","main_section_id":"661","ads":[]},{"id":"760373b9bef01a2ad2c4591ea31b83e1","title":"Not for profit","sub_title":"","author":[{"id":"0","name":"Emily Black","email":"emily.black@progressivecp.com","is_default":false}],"tag":"","strap_line":"Sector profile: Charities","short_intro":"What is the result of changes to charity regulations? ","intro":"Recent changes to charity regulation and legislation aim to cut down on the use of charitable donations for tax relief and personal gain. But, asks David Adams, is the third sector losing out as a result?","body":"<p class=\"dropcap\">Politicians on all sides have long used the charity sector as a political football. But amid the bluster, some of the recent proposals and announcements for legislation and regulation could have lasting effects on the sector. They include what may turn out to be significant changes, such as the introduction of Social Investment Tax Relief and alterations to Gift Aid, along with changes that will help specific types of organisations, like exemptions on fuel VAT for air ambulances and rescue boats.</p>\n<p>The sector has endured hard times in recent years, hit by the recession and public sector spending cuts at a time when, in many cases, those same factors have increased demand for charity services. It has also suffered from some bad publicity: around the turn of the year the Charity Commission (regulator for the sector in England and Wales) took a fearful beating in a report published by the Parliamentary Public Accounts Committee (PAC).</p>\n<p>The Commission was criticised for its “feeble” investigation into the Cup Trust scandal, when a registered charity was revealed to have been created solely for the purposes of exploiting a loophole in the Gift Aid system to claim tax relief. The Commission has since pledged to increase significantly the number of charities it subjects to in-depth accounting reviews, but it is also possible that government will, at some stage, consider proposals for reforming regulation of the sector.</p>\n<p>There are still some reasons to be cheerful. Figures published by the Charity Commission in May showed that the total income of charities in England and Wales had increased by more than £3bn to £62.8bn in the year to March 2014.</p>\n<p>But the latest Almanac published by the National Council for Voluntary Organisations (NCVO) showed that UK charities had lost more than £1.3bn in income (in cash terms, the inflation-adjusted figure is £900m) from government sources between 2010/11 and 2011/12, (the latest figures available), although income through fundraising and donations had increased by £500m. “Any charity is having to deal with the same issues: resources are tighter and demand for their services is rising,” says Andrew O’Brien, senior policy officer at the NCVO. “Some have adapted well and identified opportunities to raise additional income and deploy resources more effectively. Some have not adapted so well.”</p>\n<p>Changes to Gift Aid could help many charities. This is worth around £1.06bn to the sector, according to HMRC. Along with sector bodies, it continues to stumble towards simplification of the wording on the Declaration that donors have to sign, a simple measure that could increase donations significantly.</p>\n<p>One change already implemented was the launch in spring 2013 of Charities Online, which allows charities and other eligible organisations to claim Gift Aid repayments online rather than by post. By February 2014 the system had already paid claims for £380m of Gift Aid repayments.</p>\n<p>Charities reclaim the tax already paid on Gift Aid donations from basic rate taxpayers, but higher rate taxpayers can claim back the difference between their higher tax rate and the basic tax rate for themselves. Many in the sector would like this to change but there could be practical problems, such as the fact that the taxpayer might not want charities to know that they are a higher rate taxpayer.</p>\n<p>Others in the sector want to change corporate Gift Aid: since 2000, companies have been allowed to claim the tax relief on their donations, a change made in the hope it would encourage companies to donate more. “Over the past 13 years there’s been no evidence that corporate giving has increased,” says Joe Saxton, driver of ideas at non-profits consultancy nfpSynergy. “Most companies don’t give a huge amount to charity in comparison to their overall turnover, so don’t notice the benefit [of tax relief], whereas it would be of significant benefit to the charity.” In May 2014 research from nfpSynergy showed that Gift Aid on corporate donations could be worth £230m per year to the sector. </p>\n<p>The Gift Aid Small Donations Scheme was launched in April 2013 to make it easier for charities and other eligible organisations to claim Gift Aid on small cash donations. The government predicted the scheme would be worth £130m per year to the sector by 2018 but in its first year of operation, up to April 2014, just £7m of claims were made. Saxton believes this is largely a result of the complexity of the system and its onerous eligibility requirements, such as the fact that an organisation  must have a history of successful Gift Aid claims going back  more than two years.</p>\n<p>Another new measure, Social Investment Tax Relief, will be available once the Finance Bill passes through Parliament (expected to be in July 2014). Investors can deduct 30% of the cost of their investment from their annual income tax liability, with a minimum investment period of three years. They can also defer capital gains tax (CGT) liabilities if these are invested in a qualifying social investment; and pay no CGT on returns from  the investment itself, although they do pay income tax on dividends or interest.</p>\n<p>Eligible organisations need not necessarily be charities but must have “a defined and regulated social purpose”, employ fewer than 500 people and have gross assets worth less than £15m. Under EU rules the organisations can receive no more than €344,827 (approximately £290,000) through these investments over three years, although the investors can invest up to £1m across multiple eligible organisations. “It should enable charities to seek finance more easily than they have done before,” says Nick Brooks, head of not for profit (NFP) at the accountancy firm Kingston Smith and chairman of ICAEW’s Charity and Voluntary Sector Group. “For example, a charity looking to set up a nursing home could seek donations from supporters who would get tax relief on gifts made for those purposes. But charities will have to work out business plans, because this is not a donation. Charities will have to think about how they will pay the money back.”</p>\n<p>Helena Wilkinson, head of charities and NFP at Price Bailey and vice chairman of ICAEW’s Charity and Voluntary Sector Group, describes the new relief as “very disappointing”, particularly the investment limit. “I’m not sure there’s going to be much take-up, because it will be easier to pay out grants,” she says.</p>\n<p>“You’d have to feel confident that you had revenue coming in to repay that loan,” says Kate Sayer, partner at Sayer Vincent, a firm of chartered accountants that specialises in providing services to charities and NFP organisations. She points out that, in many cases, the cost of professional advice needed to structure the transactions and agreements between investors and these organisations will be prohibitively high for the investor. Of the 500 NFP organisations her company works with, only one, which provides microfinance overseas, has asked for further information about the relief.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"right\" ><span class=\"hide\">\"</span><p>&quot;It is a stain on our democracy that we have imposed limits on the free speech of representative groups&quot;</p>\n<span class=\"hide\">\"</span></blockquote>\n<p>Business rates relief for charities brings around £1bn back into the sector. But for how long? This is a relief claimed back from local government, which is facing more significant budget cuts, Brooks points out. He also notes that there has already been discussion in some areas about narrowing the definition of a charitable building.</p>\n<p>In 2013 the Welsh government said it was considering cutting this relief for charities from 80% to 50% by 2022, although at the time of writing this seems unlikely to happen.</p>\n<p>The sector is currently awaiting the results of a consultation led by HMRC on further measures to stop the tax and regulatory regime for the sector being used for tax avoidance.</p>\n<p>One proposal for legislation is that HMRC would not recognise charitable status if “one of the main purposes or results of its establishment is to secure a tax advantage”. In a second, seeking a tax advantage would have to be identifiable as the main purpose of the organisation for it to be denied registration.</p>\n<p>“The consultation paper goes too far,” says Brooks. “For example, if you’re setting up a philanthropic trust you could be told you’re taking tax advantage by claiming Gift Aid on donations paid into your foundation.”</p>\n<p>Sayer agrees. “Small new charities now have to divulge a lot of information about trustees and their tax affairs; and trustees are required to sign and say they’ve never been involved in any tax avoidance schemes,” she says. “But some lawyers and accountants may have worked on perfectly legal tax planning schemes. That could put them off becoming trustees and small charities really need them.”</p>\n<p>A more useful change may be to abolish the requirement for employers to pay Class 1 secondary National Insurance contributions for the under 21s. This will come into force from April 2015, probably with a fairly high earning limit of around £800 per week, so should encourage NFP organisations to employ more young people.</p>\n<p>Many third sector organisations will also be grappling with the challenges associated with implementation of auto-enrolment pension arrangements. Others face a different pensions problem: the Charity Commission has identified 740 charities with incomes greater than £500,000 that have a pension scheme deficit.</p>\n<p>“Charities’ resources used to plug the deficit can only be taken out of surpluses – you can’t really spend donations on this,” says Saxton. “But if they’re only getting very narrow surpluses – if any – that’s going to be extremely difficult.” Many are also unable to close existing pension arrangements because they are part of multi-employer schemes, often run by local authorities.</p>\n<p>Another item that needs to be considered by accountants working with or for charities is the regularly updated Statement  of Recommended Practice (SORP), issued by the Charity Commission and the Office of the Scottish Charity Regulator (OSCR) – the framework for charity accounting and financial reporting. The major change this year is a new modular structure, effectively providing a separate SORP for smaller organisations, based on the Financial Reporting Standard for Smaller Entities.</p>\n<p>Those involved in this sector will also be aware of the Lobbying Bill, which became law in January, despite strong opposition from charities concerned that its rules on spending by organisations during the run-up to elections could damage campaigning and fundraising work. The Electoral Commission is due to release further guidance in July. Labour has already said it will repeal the Bill if it wins the 2015 General Election.</p>\n<p> “It could have a really detrimental impact,” says Linda Cherrington, finance director at the Motor Neurone Disease Association (MNDA). “We have to raise awareness through campaigning, because there are many people out there who don’t understand the disease and how critical it is that people have the right care at the right time – life expectancy at diagnosis is 15 months. We’re a young charity and are heavily dependent upon fundraising and campaigns.”</p>\n<p>Asheem Singh, director of policy at the Charity Leaders Network ACEVO, is unequivocal. “The lobbying act was a legislative aberration,” he says. “At ACEVO we support the principle of transparency, but the way to achieve this was absolutely not by gagging charities and campaign groups. It is a stain on our democracy that we have imposed limits on the free speech of representative groups.”</p>\n<p>Finally, if you were looking for something that organisations of every shape and size throughout the sector might agree on, it would be the need to reduce red tape.</p>\n<p>“We must be clear: no more red tape for charities,” says  Singh. “In order to keep on delivering quality services,  especially in partnership with government, we need a moratorium on new regulations. Subjecting charities to additional burdens through Freedom of Information laws  would be a huge injustice.</p>\n<p>“Furthermore, we need government to recognise our right  to speak up on behalf of the voiceless and vulnerable, so we must resist gagging clauses in contracts and name and shame departments that insist on them.” The sector continues to support countless good causes across our society: it’s a  shame that some politicians and government agencies don’t always provide the support it needs to complete those tasks more effectively.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"callaction\"><b>An interview with Helena Wilkinson, partner and head of charities and NFP, appears in the next issue</b></p>\n","layout":{"landscape":{"id":"am-dp1-layout9","link":"story-landscape-layout5.html"},"portrait":{"id":"am-dp1-layout10","link":"story-portrait-layout5.html"}},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":"","link_source":"","image":[{"id":"288e2f0002e1d157481520f3121efe28","name":"Charity","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com/var/economia/storage/images/charity/56576-1-eng-GB/charity_story_img_size_768x929.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"768","height":"929","is_default":true},{"id":"288e2f0002e1d157481520f3121efe28","name":"Charity","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com/var/economia/storage/images/charity/56576-1-eng-GB/charity_story_img_size_1024x673.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"1024","height":"673","is_default":false}],"url_alias":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com","type":"story","order":"20","folio_number":"0","folio_numbers":"","pdf_page_index":"0","thumbnail":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com/var/economia/storage/images/charity/56576-1-eng-GB/charity_tablet_story_thumbnail.jpg","color":"e9ae00","real_id":"6075","main_section_id":"661","ads":[]},{"id":"2251fab75bcb3f7ab60625d2a5707d18","title":"Measuring the value of audit","sub_title":"","author":[{"id":"0","name":"Emily Black","email":"emily.black@progressivecp.com","is_default":false}],"tag":"","strap_line":"Sponsored feature: KPMG","short_intro":"","intro":"Accurately measuring audit quality was identified as a pressing issue for the profession at the first  of a series of Value of Audit roundtables hosted  by economia in association with KPMG","body":"<p class=\"dropcap\">While Paul Boyle, chief audit officer at Aviva, welcomed recent improvements in audit (and recognised that there is always more that can be done), he added that the mere fact of having an audit at all was often enough to make sure executives behaved.</p>\n<p>“The value of audit isn’t to be measured by the beauty and elegance of the financial statements that are produced,” he said. “It’s the unseen difference between the financial statements that are produced, and what would otherwise be produced without audit, due to a combination of simple errors and over-optimism in the absence of effective challenge, and in some cases, manipulation. That difference between what you see and what you would have seen otherwise, is important.”</p>\n<p>Tony Cates, head of audit, KPMG UK, pointed out that this perspective highlighted the role audit has to play in building trust. “As a firm, we’ve been involved in the debate around restoring trust in business, which is really important. The public has lost trust in big business, in particular. And a big part of that debate is the trust in auditors, the profession, what auditors do and what broader things we bring to bear.”</p>\n<p>Melanie McLaren, executive director at Financial Reporting Council (FRC) and the board member responsible for codes and standards, added that audit played a central role in fostering a strong environment for investment. “The FRC’s mission is to encourage high-quality corporate reporting and corporate governance, to foster investment. Obviously, the annual report and accounts is key. But we also believe that audit is a fundamental underpin of that model, and therefore is fundamental to capital markets. Our role is to make sure there’s justifiable confidence  in audit.”</p>\n<p>For his part, Peter Montagnon, associate director at the Institute of Business Ethics, agreed trust remains an issue. “It is deeply worrying to read in the <i>Financial Times</i> that 50% of Tory supporters think the government should crack down on big business. That’s half of Tory supporters and 72% of Labour supporters. UKIP and the Lib Dems are in the middle. There is a problem here, and we need to fix it. But I’m not sure how far audit is central to that, because audit has to do with  the health of the capital market, rather than trust.”</p>\n<p>Alan Ferguson, a serial non-executive director and chair of four audit committees (each of which employ a different one of the Big Four for their audit) added that the audit has definitely risen up the business agenda in recent years. Having been either a finance director or audit committee chairman for 16 years, he said he’d recently been contacted for the first time ever by an investor wanting to talk about audit. “Something’s stirring out there, which is interesting.”</p>\n<p>Boyle highlighted the impact of recent developments in audit reporting, and the expanded audit report now required. “With what is now being proposed the UK is leading the world in terms of what the audit report says about the most important factors the auditor thought about.”</p>\n<p>Highlighting KPMG’s audit report for Rolls-Royce, which has been acclaimed as a best-practice example of the new approach, Boyle added, “With Rolls-Royce, KPMG not only described the big issues it had to  deal with in relation to that audit,  it also described the conclusions  it came to in relation to those issues. For the first time, ever, audit reports are actually worth reading, because they say something different and interesting.”</p>\n<p>Cates admitted there had been a determined effort to make sure with Rolls-Royce (and two other pilot audits) that the firm “reported the stones we turned over, but also described what we’d found”.</p>\n<p>These developments have already changed the nature of conversations in audit committees. This was hailed by Boyle as “probably the most significant development in auditing  in years”.</p>\n<p>Robert Hodgkinson, executive director, technical at ICAEW, pointed out that the profession’s ambition must be to build on this development. “It’s noticeable that there was a bit of market differentiation in what KPMG was looking to do, beyond what even the FRC was asking for. That’s interesting, and as a mechanism for innovation, it’s good. At a time of the biggest change in audit reporting, you decided to do something more, as opposed to saying ‘we’ve got enough to cope with’. It will be interesting to see whether you can maintain momentum and whether others will look to innovate in response, or whether that one surge of innovation will be enough to last for the next half-century.”</p>\n<p>Ferguson agreed there is a challenge to keep it interesting. “Because next year you know it will be something similar, that’s the reality of these things,” he said.</p>\n<p>Ferguson was also concerned about crossover with other reports. “We have to think about the audit committee report. I’ve personally spent a huge amount of time on it and there’s a danger of overlap. Companies and auditors have to work hard to try to differentiate that. But I’m hoping shareholders are genuinely going to read it.”</p>\n<p>Robin Freestone, CFO at Pearson, also saw potential issues with maintaining interest. “The differentiation of audit reports is something to be welcomed,” he said. “It will be interesting to see where it goes. There’s a debate to be had around materiality. When a company can talk about plus or minus £100m in their accounts, that’s an issue. So, there are further debates to come. I also worry that the differentiation in year one is easier than it is in year five, as over time this might become a more boilerplate and we converge in the same space, which means it isn’t so well differentiated. And it remains difficult to assess audit quality, other than by the quality of the audit report at the end of the process. That’s true even when one’s being audited, let alone as an independent reader of a set of financial results.”</p>\n<p>Ferguson agreed, adding that the debates so far on issues such as reporting standards and competition in the audit market had forced the profession to be inward-focused. “That goal of one global standard made everybody rather introspective, and I’m not sure it’s really moved the needle in any sense, other than in a slightly negative sense. And the audit competition debate, so far, has made the profession quite introspective, because everybody is asking what it means to them. There’s an awful lot of game theories in terms of plotting and who is going to go out to tender.”</p>\n<blockquote class=\"right\" ><span class=\"hide\">\"</span><p>&quot;The audit competition debate, so far, has made the profession quite introspective, because everybody is asking what it means to them&quot;</p>\n<p>ALAN FERGUSON</p>\n<span class=\"hide\">\"</span></blockquote>\n<p>For Montagnon, the debate on IFRS has led auditors to seek to use the standards for other purposes. “I’m an outside observer, but I’ve been around the issue for some time and I agree we are in a better place now than when everybody was pushing IFRS and it seemed, to shareholders and investors, that audit firms were using this to promote standards that would limit their liability. In a way, the failure of convergence has created an opportunity for more discussion around the way in which decisions have been made. We can do this in a way that opens up the debate with shareholders, and opens up our understanding of differentiation, and makes the choice [of auditor] more interesting, when it comes to rotation. Through this process, it should be possible for shareholders to get to know a bit more about what they’re buying.”</p>\n<p>But for Freestone the idea that this discussion might lead to mandatory rotation is problematic. “I have strong views on rotation. This is not a 100 Group comment, but I have always felt there was a severe danger that mandatory rotation would have precisely the inverse effects of what it was designed to achieve. That danger is still there. Rotation has a fantastic effect, from a perception point of view. And while that was one problem that was trying to be solved, in terms of whole new audit teams turning up every five years, or whatever it turns out to be, I don’t think that will stimulate quality. And I don’t think we’re going to see costs come down, in fact we’ll see them go up. And we’re going to have more limited choice than we’ve had in the past. As a result you’ll see greater concentration of the Big Four further down into the FTSE 350. All of this is bad and yet I suspect this is the direction we’re heading in.”</p>\n<p>For the FRC, McLaren was clear that they had never been in favour of mandatory rotation. “We focus, first and foremost, on quality and things that improve quality, but we’re realistic. The fact is that the audit market is very concentrated, and we’ve never been persuaded that in a market where you have limited choice, to take away the choice of the current incumbent and limit your choice further was going to help. But we do need a mechanism for dealing with the perception that the longer the tenure of the audit, if you’re not testing it regularly, the more cosy the relationship becomes. That is why  we alighted on re-tendering and we’re pleased re-tendering has been swept up into the European solution with essentially a 22-year backstop, that you must rotate after a period  of time.”</p>\n<p>For Will Pomroy, policy lead on governance and stewardship at NAPF, this still presented some problems for investors, who had alighted on the idea of rotation partly to address perceived issues of cosiness and a lack of independence. “Investors were blamed as corporations for the financial crisis and they were to blame, to some extent. One of the things they’ve looked at is the regulatory system, and regulation of the financial markets and the confidence in them. One of the perceived problems was how are they ensuring independence is maintained and that auditors are serving their interests? A quick fix that some people fell on was mandatory rotation, because they didn’t have confidence in the audit market to ensure tendering, on its own, would be enough. There was an assumption that tendering would result in going through the motions and not a great deal of change.”</p>\n<p>Montagnon agreed mandatory rotation is dangerous, but he said it was clear why investors might like the idea of it. “You’ve got to understand why they’ve got the wrong end of the stick. It’s because companies have had the same auditor for decades, and don’t show any indication of change, and there’s quite obviously a cosy relationship behind it.”</p>\n<p>For Ferguson, having been a finance director and audit committee chairman, close relationships between the parties were important and he suggested a powerful analogy to describe the perfect relationship. “The audit committee chairman has more responsibility and a more clearly defined role these days. Which is good. But I have an analogy of the three points of a triangle: the finance director and the audit partner were an awful lot closer, and the audit committee chairman was somewhere over to one side. But it should be an equilateral triangle because I don’t think we can afford to have the triangle skewed either way. I don’t think the investment community or the Competition Commission want the finance director over at one side and the audit partner and audit committee chairman close together. That doesn’t work, either.”</p>\n<p>For Pomroy that triangle should also consider shareholders. “What it alludes to is that we were a long way to one side, and the shareholders were skewed a long way from the other two. Some of the solutions  on audit rotation will resolve a lot  of the concerns. After all, 20 years  is quite a long backstop and therefore the impacts on competition, having to rotate on a 20-year cycle should  be manageable.”</p>\n<blockquote class=\"right\" ><span class=\"hide\">\"</span><p>&quot;There was an assumption that tendering would result in going through the motions and not a great deal of change&quot;</p>\n<p>WILL POMROY</p>\n<span class=\"hide\">\"</span></blockquote>\n<p>What was clear throughout the discussion was the significant agreement that public trust in business and in audit, even by default, had broken down and that rebuilding it will take time. The policy approach to help resolve this breakdown and restore trust in financial reporting and capital markets has started to have a positive impact, with some movement in areas such as audit reporting. And yet, there was still a strong sense that there is much more that needs to be done to really get a grasp on what we mean by audit quality and what a good audit looks like. While most present were dismissive that mandatory rotation would mean higher quality audits, there was agreement that the standard policy approach to the issue of trust had been to talk about more transparency and greater competition in markets. As the FRC’s McLaren pointed out, it was important the profession avoided falling into the trap of making such “lazy policy” changes for the sake of achieving quick wins. </p>\n<p>And yet the biggest question on the day remained how the role and scope of audit is defined to be of value to all parties. This gets back to having a more detailed understanding of how we measure audit quality and what expectations we place on auditors to be able to identify and understand any future risks facing the business. Is that achievable from a backward snapshot at last year’s numbers? Should auditors be required to offer assurance on wider elements, such as the viability of the business model over the longer term, or to identify any significant risks on the near horizon? </p>\n<p>Ferguson spoke for many when he expressed the view that modern audit has lost some key elements from the traditional process. “In my day, I used to walk the floor and while we didn’t have the IT systems, we had to go and find a piece of paper. Now when I’m in as chairman of the audit committee I find the auditors all in a room, staring intently at a computer screen. I’ve no idea what they’re doing. It could be like my son doing his revision. I think audit quality  is an area where there’s a long way  to go to peel the onion a bit and where everybody would benefit.”</p>\n<p>Freestone concurred. “Audit quality is something that we have  to really pin down, in terms of working out how we measure it, because otherwise these debates are quite difficult. We can’t say we’re definitively moving forward. It becomes judgemental. I think we are moving forward and the quality of audit has got notably better over recent years in a more complex environment. But public trust is a more complex issue, because it can be so easily undermined by very small things.”  </p>\n<p>Pomroy added that investors are also concerned with quality: “Audit quality is what lay behind requests from investors to focus on rotation and tendering. But audit reporting that’s come into play this year has been welcomed by investors. We’ve referenced the Rolls-Royce report, but the majority of audit reports, while useful to the board still leave a ‘so-what?’ question, in many regards.”</p>\n<p>The desire for the profession to work out the best future approach was expressed by Hodgkinson: “I think we need to work out how to have an auditing profession that is dynamic, in the sense there’s an engagement with the issues that businesses need to address, and that the wider public are interested in. And it would be good to see a dynamic for developing what auditing does that isn’t reliant upon crises. The history of auditing progresses by landmarks in terms  of what we did in relation to the last crisis. There will still be crises, but it would be nice to anticipate some and have a process for engagement that builds trust.”</p>\n<div class=\"am_info_box\">\n\t<fieldset>\n\t<legend><div>ATTENDEES AT

recruitment","short_intro":"","intro":"It may be one of the UK’s biggest recruiters, but the accountancy profession is still struggling to get the quantity and quality of graduates it needs. Alison Coleman investigates why","body":"<p class=\"dropcap\">Accountancy firms are finding it more difficult than ever to find the calibre of graduates they need from the UK education system. But is that because graduate numbers are falling or are academic standards simply slipping?</p>\n<p>As one of the largest recruiters of graduates in the UK, the prospect of a skills shortage is a serious concern to the accounting profession. And more graduate vacancies are expected to be available this year, according to the Association of Graduate Recruiters (AGR), which predicts that job openings in banking and financial services could rise by as much as 15.7%.</p>\n<p>But is there more to this graduate talent gap than meets the eye?</p>\n<p>Since the advent of “widening participation” agendas and the aim of opening higher education to more school and college leavers, it is less likely that there would be a shortage in the number of graduates. There may, however, be a shortage of graduates who possess, or know how to display, the attributes required by employers.</p>\n<p>AGR chief executive Stephen Isherwood confirms this: “We know that even through the darkest days of the recession, our members reported unfilled vacancies because they couldn’t find graduates with the right mix of skills and attributes.”</p>\n<p>What most students are unlikely to have is any commercial awareness, which is arguably one of the most desirable competencies for the accounting profession.</p>\n<p>While business and accounting degrees provide graduates with the opportunity to develop their commercial awareness, how effective they are, in terms of “work readiness” at least, depends on whether they are being taught by academics who are also practitioners with practical experience of the marketplace, or by those taking a purely theoretical approach without implementing it.</p>\n<p>Students on the BSc accountancy programme at Manchester Business School undergo rigorous training in the basics of accounting techniques and academic theory, but also have the opportunity to meet people from the business world.</p>\n<p>Programme director Penny Clarke says: “This involves them engaging in projects which allow them to work with practitioners and government bodies, and attend presentations from standard-setters and those directly involved in the profession.”</p>\n<p>Standards of numeracy could be another factor in the profession’s perceived lack of graduate talent. They have shown no improvement in the past three years, according to the latest PISA tests of 15-year-olds in 65 different countries in maths, reading and science.</p>\n<p>In maths, the performance of British 15-year-olds is now three years behind that of the world’s highest-achieving education system, Shanghai (though it should be noted that Shanghai is not representative of China as a whole).</p>\n<p>Clarke says: “In my experience, many students do indeed lack numeracy skills, relying on calculators for the answer. This deficiency also extends to their research skills, with Wikipedia seeming to be the first source for solutions to research questions.</p>\n<p>“University study provides the opportunity to learn how to research and critically evaluate a wide range of sources, which is a skill graduates need to put into practice when advising clients. There may be  more than one ‘right’ answer. The ACA training is incredibly challenging and requires a high degree of commitment and dedication from  the trainee. A graduate considering an accountancy training contract needs to be aware of the intellectual challenges they will face and the aptitude they need to possess to  meet it.”</p>\n<p>Then there are the UK’s well-publicised skill shortages in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) skills, some of the most in-demand talents within IT, construction, finance and, of course, within accountancy.</p>\n<p>Traditionally an attractive option for graduates with strong numeracy skills, accountancy firms have found themselves competing with a widening group of organisations in other sectors which have been targeting this desirable talent.</p>\n<p>Howard Flint, managing director at recruitment specialists Omni RMS, says: “An ageing workforce, ‘brain drain’, increase in vacancies and a restrictive migration policy mean that the country’s accountancy sector is set to be hit hard; multiple reports and surveys have indicated that the shortage is becoming critical.</p>\n<p>“With a shrinking talent pool, the industry must fight harder than ever before to attract the highest-quality STEM employees, especially now when up against those, such as IT businesses, which are potentially viewed by young candidates as more dynamic. With financial reward no longer an overriding factor in career choice, the key to succeeding in enticing the best is to develop an attractive employer brand, one where the best candidates actively want to work for you.”</p>\n<p>Other factors that have a bearing on graduate recruitment targets include shifting job hunting strategies. Competition to be accepted onto a blue chip graduate training programme at all costs sees many undergraduates taking a scattergun approach of applying across all sectors to as many schemes as possible; but this is hardly a strategic approach to professional career planning.</p>\n<p>Today’s top graduates are also very aware of their value to talent-hungry employers. According to a report by consultancy firm FreshMinds, the brightest graduates know what they want from their first job and, as the so-called “war for talent” rages among major employers, many think they can find it in the technology, media and telecommunications sector.</p>\n<p>The survey findings suggest that graduates are looking beyond the usual accountancy and consultancy sectors – known for their large graduate recruitment programmes and extensive campus presence – to IT and media companies.</p>\n<p>While the largest proportion of recent top graduates ended up in banking and finance (13%), technology and media companies were not far behind at 12%, while consultancy and accountancy took just 8% and 4% respectively.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"right\" ><span class=\"hide\">\"</span><p>“With financial reward no longer an overriding factor in career choice,  the key is to develop an attractive employer brand — one where the best candidates want to work for you”</p>\n<span class=\"hide\">\"</span></blockquote>\n<p>Perhaps one of the biggest challenges and frustrations for recruiting firms is the fixation that students have on the Big Four, which leaves them overlooking extremely good training opportunities in Group A and smaller firms.</p>\n<p>The fact is, training opportunities with the Big Four are that much more publicised and advertised than the alternatives, and inevitably attract the lion’s share of graduate applications because EY, KPMG, PwC and Deloitte are names – often the only names – graduates are familiar with.</p>\n<p>Shirish Mistry, national head of resourcing at Mazars, agrees that this has created huge recruitment challenges for many firms, including his own. “Whenever we go to university career days and other events, we find that students really don’t know who we are,” he says.</p>\n<p>“I believe that this is partly due to the fact that university careers advisors are not providing them with all the information they need to consider all options within the profession. They only think about the Big Four, and that leaves the BDOs, the Grant Thorntons, and ourselves with the much bigger task of getting our branding out there, via ICAEW, web portals and journals, to show students what we have to offer.”</p>\n<p>He also remarks that the future graduates they are presenting to often have little idea of what accountancy actually entails. Their perception of a career in accountancy is frequently restricted to “doing things with numbers” and “being good at maths”.</p>\n<p>“I have had people come along from the firm to talk to students about the various functions within accountancy, such as tax and internal audit, and you can see from their response that this is a revelation for them. They had no idea that the accountancy profession was this varied or as interesting,” adds Mistry.While the Big Four are never going to suffer from a shortage of skilled graduates knocking on their doors, even they have seen changes in the calibre of applicants that have led them to take action.</p>\n<p>EY receives around 16,000 graduate applications each year, which it filters down to around 3,000 applicants who are then interviewed.</p>\n<p>Head of student recruitment Julie Stanbridge says: “We are only in the market for the very best talent, and we are not just looking at their academic achievements or emotional intelligence; it is very much a search for the all rounder, and we have the strategies and assessment processes in place which can identify them.</p>\n<p>“One change we have noticed in recent years is a greater focus on the importance of employability skills – so important in this profession – and we are working with the universities that we recruit from to help undergraduates develop those skills.”</p>\n<p>Angus Farr, director and lead trainer at training organisation Training Counts, spends a great deal of his time travelling the country and in his own words: “Scaring second year undergraduates into preparing for the workplace.”</p>\n<p>Farr, who is also a chartered accountant, asks: “Is there a gap between what accountancy employers want and what they get?</p>\n<p>“I would say yes. But is it more acute now than in previous years? I’m not sure. There certainly seems to be a paradox, where more and more graduates are coming onto the market, and yet employers still say they are struggling to find the talent they need.”</p>\n<p>There is also a big gap between what students think they are applying for and what they are actually letting themselves in for, he continues.</p>\n<p>“There is still an understanding that exists among graduates that if you are numerate you will be able to pass the professional exams and be well suited to life as an accountant.</p>\n<p>“The reality is, what really matters  are the softer skills: good communication, interpersonal skills. Being a good accountant is about much more than being good at passing exams,” adds Farr.</p>\n\n<div class=\"object-right factbox\">\n<table bgcolor=\"#eeeeee\">\n<tr>\n    <td>\n    <div class=\"text\"><h2>OVERSEAS TALENT SHORTAGES</h2><p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Graduate recruitment is a challenge for accountancy firms all over the world, with those in Malaysia having to invest a significant amount to secure the graduate talent they need.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Wei Yuen Loh, ICAEW’s head of Malaysia, says: “A lot of effort goes into recruiting top talent, and the attrition rate is high. One firm told us it is not unusual to see 30% attrition in the first two years. Malaysian graduates are highly sought after by overseas firms, and many are recruited by Singaporean companies, although exact figures are not available.”</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As part of its plan to become a high-income nation, the Malaysian government has implemented a number of strategies, one of the key ones being to address the need to have professionally qualified accountants to support the economy.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>TalentCorp is a government agency set up to look into getting Malaysian talent back home and attract foreign talent from overseas through its Returning Expert Programme. It also provides financial incentives to encourage small and medium sized firms and companies to train more accountants, and the Big Four plus BDO to train non-accounting graduates. “We are working with TalentCorp to encourage ACA training in Malaysia for non-Malaysians by facilitating a five-year work visa,” says Loh.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Peneraju is another government agency that has been set up to provide financial incentives for Bumiputera, or local Malays, to train as professional accountants.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In March, the Malaysian Big Four, plus other major employers, were at Chartered Accountants’ Hall in London for an insight and recruitment event, which brought together employers and potential ACA students interested in training in Malaysia.</p>\n</div>\n    </td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n</div><div class=\"am_info_box\">\n\t<fieldset>\n\t<legend><div>SOFT SKILLS ON THE RISE</div></legend>\n\t<div class=\"text\"><p>Employers want to see an in-depth knowledge of accountancy, finance and business, but they are also looking for skills learnt outside the classroom, says Hazel Garvey, director of business development at ICAEW.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“They are looking for new recruits to be professional, ethical and good communicators,” she explains. “Recruits need to work well with others, be eager to learn and act professionally.

But where does it sit on the balance sheet?","body":"<h2>INTRO TO IP</h2><p>Intellectual property (IP) is all about us: from brand names to marketing to customer goodwill. To say companies don’t pay attention to intellectual property is an understatement. IP can be worth up to 80% of corporate value – perhaps more. Research from innovation charity Nesta and the Work Foundation claims company investment in intangibles now exceeds that of tangible assets.</p>\n<p>Yet in 2014, accounting rules still prohibit brand names being named as a value in corporate filings.</p>\n<p>But this antediluvian attitude to IP is starting to change, as are financing options for IP. So does that mean it’s time for a fresh look, then?</p>\n<p>One issue with any discussion around intellectual property is that it doesn’t come with a homogenous set of rights – and not all rights are equal. Some IP can be so far ahead of its time it can be almost worthless.</p>\n<p>“My favourite example,” says Lorna Brazell, IP expert at law firm Osborne Clarke, “is the zip. It was invented in the 1920s and quickly became universal after the Second World War, but the patent rights had expired. Nobody benefited. That’s a tragedy. So you can be ahead of your time, but it’s about what is being used, or applied, in the market today or tomorrow.”</p>\n<p>In essence, IP consists of a number of rights relevant to a number of industries. Each of those categories of rights has a different legal impact and so is different for each valuation. That’s the tricky subjectivity out of the way (for the moment).</p>\n<p>However, for many businesses – especially start-ups – IP is often all you have, points out Matthew Jones, partner at EIP Legal. “When you’re first starting up a company, what you don’t have is plant, machinery, a product – even money,” he explains. “But you do have a concept or a notion or a design or plan. That’s all about IP. So the entire value of the company, when it’s very young, is bound up in IP.”</p>\n<p>The downturn in the global economy between 2007 and 2012 saw insolvency practitioners take an increasingly close interest in IP, with many distressed businesses seeing intangible assets being sold off, often in haste. Now, as the global economy recovers, IP remains equally relevant.</p>\n<p>“A lot of people think that intellectual property is about new industry, or the new economy,” comments Kelvin King, co-author of a coalition report, Banking on IP. “But it’s not. It’s fundamentally not. It’s also old economy – hotels with brand names, manufacturing and engineering with patents. It’s media, music and film copyright.”</p>\n<p>It’s also about education and awareness; in other words, it’s still exceptionally misunderstood.</p>\n<p>One IP research report interviewed 500 SMEs and discovered that 84% valued their IP at… zero. Intellectual property, be aware, is not just designs or logos, but also about goodwill, domain names, trademarks, copyrights, confidential information and databases.</p>\n<h2>HOW DO I VALUE IP?</h2><p>There’s a rash of accountancy-approved ways of working out the value of intellectual property over the years. But the underlying principal is that such formulas are only as good as the data you put in (if you put garbage in, you get garbage out).</p>\n<p>“The one broad rule is tax,” warns Osborne Clarke’s Brazell. “If you estimate the value of your patent portfolio at £10m and you try to change it in future, then your transfer tax liability will be different.</p>\n<p>“But if you don’t make an estimate today, then the taxman may make his own calculation.”</p>\n<p>Of course, valuations become more of an issue when selling. And while IP valuation is a long way from selling a house, there remain similarities says Isabel Napper, partner and head of technology at law firm Mills &amp; Reeve in Cambridge.</p>\n<p>“The situation is like wanting to look at the value of your property on Zoopla. You’re looking at neighbouring houses, how long they took to sell and what price was achieved. It’s [IP] very much done on the same basis. Specialists will retain databases of what past deals were done.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"right\" ><span class=\"hide\">\"</span><p><b>“The zip was invented in the 1920s and quickly became universal after the Second World War. But the patent rights had expired. Nobody benefited”</b></p>\n<p>Lorna Brazell, IP expert, Osborne Clarke</p>\n<span class=\"hide\">\"</span></blockquote>\n<p>“You might, for example, have a specialist database on medicinal products rather than engineering components,” explains Napper.</p>\n<p>So far, so good. But if the IP is more disruptive than existing technology, then it’s more of a challenge. And this is where the British housing market analogy keels promptly over – for a bit. “Some clients,” says Napper, “do have really exciting new ideas that seem to be game-changing, but they haven’t thought through the commercial application of it. And that is the downfall of a lot of IP ideas. It’s all very well coming up with an iPad,” she goes on. “But what was clever about the iPad was all the apps you could use with it.”</p>\n<p>David Clark, partner at patent and trademark attorneys Appleyard Lees, says that if you’re buying IP, you need to establish early on who you’re acquiring it from – understand very clearly the chain of ownership. Are you sure they own the copyright so you can acquire it?</p>\n<p>“Another risk is that all these IP rights are negative rights; they are the right to stop other people doing something they would otherwise be free to do,” he says. “You have to look beyond the exclusions/restrictions you can place on others to think about what earlier broader restrictions that may be relevant. Buying rights in is not a shortcut to freedom to operate. There may be broader rights outstanding in the areas you want to operate in.”</p>\n<p>Fundamentally, established methodologies for valuing IP exist and, equally importantly, are accepted by courts and tax authorities. That also means banks, finally, are starting to get a firmer grasp of IP too.</p>\n<h2>THE BEST WAYS TO EXPLOIT IP</h2><p>Be aware that a lot of IP created is, by nature, speculative. That means there may well be value in it for someone, somewhere. “Someone may well treat their tech rights as a single indivisible thing,” says Brazell. “You might have a patent on a coating for saucepans. But that coating might be very useful for an application for industrial reactors.” So lateral thinking is encouraged.</p>\n<p>\nThere’s a rash of options to exploit IP, from protecting products and services to blocking others from entering the market says Nicola McNeely, partner at Capital Law. <br /> “IP rights help businesses establish and develop reputations and goodwill. That can be invaluable for businesses looking to expand or set up in new territories as a good reputation elsewhere can help to drum up trade early on,” she says.</p>\n<p>An IP rights framework can also help businesses to licence their IP to third parties in return for commission or royalties, providing useful revenue streams in situations where the IP owner can’t, perhaps, deploy the IP themselves.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile funding gaps for many companies can be considerable. Take the example of Splash Damage/Fireteam, an independently-owned games developer which creates high-end, multi-user online games. It recently brought two sought-after software tools to market, Echo and X-ray, which analyse player behaviour while games are being played. This distinctive IP was, therefore, highly valuable. Using Lombard Technology Services’ Software Licence Solution (SLS), this provided a route to free up capital without hitting the operation of software licenses.</p>\n<p>The upshot? By deploying the SLS, Splash Damage/Fireteam took capital previously tied up in pricey licence fees and development costs. “As a direct result,” Ian McVicar, managing director of Lombard Technology Services says, “The company has secured new leads, engaged with other major players and plans to accelerate development of new games.”</p>\n<blockquote class=\"right\" ><span class=\"hide\">\"</span><p><b>“It’s all very well coming up with an iPad.

He says the crowd funding movement – such as Crowdcube and Seeders – has also moved the game on. Effectively this is where investors evaluate the potential of the business, “which is absolutely rooted in IP”. More staid arrangements remain – for example the franchise model, exported nationally and internationally. However, Tavener points to the rise in pension-led funding, an option increasingly relevant where there is no issue of change of control. This is where a SIPP, for example, can buy up IP from a company, leasing it back with payments made from the pension (some limits exist – up to around 70% of a pension’s value).</p>\n<p>So in conclusion, yes, there are risks, but ultimately it’s funding for directors by directors.

Unlike their corporate counterparts, their governance structures are more opaque. This is a consequence of the partnership model which gives a high degree of independence to each country in which the Big Four operates. Global organisations –in general – and the Big Four in particular invite the following question: to what extent is there convergence or divergence between their operations in different countries?</p>\n<p>We set out to answer this question by researching partners in Canada, France and the UK. We were particularly interested in the types of people that became partner and the process of them actually getting there. Was this similar across the three countries or were there striking differences?</p>\n<p>The broad career structure is much the same across the three contexts: following qualification, employees move into the manager position – during which time many tend to leave the firm – before proceeding to senior manager, director and ultimately partner. Only 2-3% of members of the Big Four will ever make partner; ascension to this position is to enter the elite of the accounting profession. In provincial cities, Big Four partners are well known “business celebrities”, while in capital cities they are players within their service lines. Partners are the pinnacle of the accounting profession for those that remain in private practice.</p>\n<p>We started by looking at British and Canadian partners. What we found was remarkably similar: it takes most partners 15-17 years to become a partner after joining; 60 to 70 hour weeks are the norm; partners are more likely to be white and male; the process of becoming a partner has become far more formalised than it was in the past; most people who make partnership highlight the importance of “having a good mentor” to help them navigate the complex, Byzantine politics of a Big Four firm.</p>\n<p>To add to this picture, interviewees emphasised the importance of trust: does the firm trust a candidate enough to make them a part-owner? All of this takes place against a broader economic backdrop which will determine whether a particular service is deemed worthy of supporting a further partner. The economic conditions can in boom times create more partnerships in a firm; recessionary times can preclude gifted candidates from making partner. </p>\n<p>We talked to over 50 partners, ex-partners and people who didn’t make partner in Britain and Canada. The similarities far overshadowed any differences. Partners were very much “self-made men” and, save for a few exceptions, were drawn from modest social backgrounds. This meritocratic quality was deeply infused within the firms we visited, with a notable ‘can do’ ethos. The driven quality of the partners often extended to their leisure pursuits. Whereas the stereotype is of a partner playing a good deal of golf, they were much more likely to be competing in endurance cycle races or long distance running events. The participation in endurance sports is a fitting metaphor. Partners are driven, high energy people who exude self-confidence.</p>\n<p>By midway through our research we were accustomed to partners recounting that “their career was different”. This statement surprised us as most of the partners spent most of their careers in one firm, something that is very unusual in the contemporary workplace, and we imagined that there was a distinct career path. The expression, however, spoke to the different ways in which the partners had proved themselves.</p>\n<p>In every case, the accountant “proved themselves” through completing a difficult piece of work that gained praise from the firm. This demonstrated that the accountant had ability and could be trusted by the organisation. This building of reputation brought the accountant into new networks in the firm where more opportunities arose. Proving oneself as being very good at a complex job is generally enough to get a promotion to director. Beyond that, wannabe partners need to demonstrate that they can move effortlessly with senior executives in client firms and that they can generate revenue. It’s a cliché, but cash is king. The Big Four are packed full of extremely competent technical specialists – what makes someone stand out is their ability to generate fee income. Entrepreneurialism is a prime quality.  </p>\n<p>The similarities between British and Canadian partners were striking regarding this topic, in fact the only compelling difference was that British partners went for football and  rugby metaphors, while their Canadian counterparts used ice hockey and NFL.</p>\n<p>We travelled to France to find out about the French experience. Our intuition was that the capacity to generate new business would be crucial there too but that leverages to increase turnover might be of a different nature. In particular we expected that belonging to a cultural or social elite would be essential for partners to bring in new business in France. The  Big Four are similarly prominent in France, although there are different rules around audit rotation. What became immediately clear was the Big Four are structured differently in France.</p>\n<p>First, it was incredibly important where an employee had studied. In France, there are a number of Grandes Ecoles that are, in effect, elite Business Schools. The Big Four strive to recruit a quota from each of these schools. Unlike in Britain, where the Big Four recruit from a wide range of universities and where partners are pretty diverse in terms of their educational backgrounds, in France attending one of these Grande Ecoles will vastly increase your chances of getting recruited in the first instance, and is even more important in rising to partner grade in the second instance.</p>\n<p>One of our French partners explained: “We are worried when we don’t have enough ‘parisiennes’ [graduates of top Grandes Ecoles]. I find that daft but in this firm we always have the illusion that if you haven’t been to a ‘parisienne’ then you can’t be a partner. That said, given that the clients of tomorrow will have studied at the same place, it is better to have them.”</p>\n<p>The quote reveals a great deal about how educational background is a determinant of future success in the Big Four in France. Simply put, having graduated from a top school (a parisienne) marks out an employee as special and puts them onto a different career trajectory from those who had attended more routine universities. In France Big Four firms agree with each other on starting salary grids depending on the school category of their recruits. High expectations are placed very early on their recruits from Grandes Ecoles and this has a very basic economic rationale. </p>\n<p>It is through the process of offering parisiennes more varied and exciting work – projects that add value and generally “pampering” them – that their “specialness” becomes a reality in the French Big Four. Contrary to what we expected, educational pedigree actually becomes more important at the partner level: it is easier for graduates of the Grandes Ecoles to interact with each other and so future sources of revenue will come through the conversion of their educational background into social skills and new business for the firm. It is a fascinating contrast to the British and Canadian experiences where the treatment of recruits is much more homogeneous. More broadly, the French experience is suggestive of the grip that Grandes Ecoles have on elite careers within the French corporate sector.</p>\n<p>The Grandes Ecoles cast a long shadow over the Big Four in France; this raises questions as to whether a different set of qualities are required to become partner. A key insight from our research study is that the pressures that French partners and aspirant partners face are much the same as in Britain and Canada: clients need to be kept happy; new business needs to be generated and delivered; new service lines need to be developed; for personal career strategies, aspirant partners need to be seen as less technical and more strategic.</p>\n<p>In short, the descriptions of the Big Four in France were remarkably similar to their counterparts in Britain and Canada. What was particularly striking was the creed of commercialism that underpins the Big Four across the three countries. One partner in France explained: “The first thing we look at is [the candidate’s] commercial skills. Dilution [of profit-per-partner] is a real concern for us. If partners don’t bring in revenue, the partners’ committee will lose money because there is less to share in the end. So the capacity to make business grow obviously matters a lot.”</p>\n<p>This quote could have come from any of the firms in any of the three countries. The ability to generate business and ‘grow the cake’ is an absolutely central skill for someone who wants to make partner. The central difference between Britain, Canada and France is that in the French case the assumption is that being a graduate of a Grandes Ecoles will help generate new business. In Britain and Canada it is demonstrably not the case that an elite degree will lead to these outcomes. In France, attendance at one of these schools has a huge bearing on an alumnus’s future career in the Big Four.</p>\n<p>Our research emphasises that people skills – the ability to  get on with people and build durable networks – are crucial to success in a Big Four career. These skills need to be converted into revenues. To put this in some sort of context, the following revenues were quoted to us. In Canada, one interviewee suggested that a partner needed to generate around $3m (Canadian) per annum (£1.63m), in France this figure was estimated at €3m (£2.4m), whereas in Britain, a figure of £2m was frequently cited. Partners are clearly under pressure to generate vast sums of fee income for the Big Four; the prospect of being able to generate such fees is crucial to ascending to  a partnership.</p>\n<p>We started this article speculating about the convergence and divergence across the Big Four in Britain, Canada and France. We explored this in relation to partnerships in each of these jurisdictions. To our surprise there was strikingly little difference between Britain and Canada: careers broadly followed the same pattern in both countries. In contrast, France was a case apart. Interestingly, the objectives of the firms were broadly the same, but the educational backgrounds that were deemed necessary to become senior in the Big Four were very different. In Britain and Canada the Big Four are important bastions of meritocracy: once you get in, it’s up to you to prove what you can do. In France, the dice are loaded in favour of those holding elite Grandes Ecoles qualifications, it predestines their route to the top. For those entering French firms without elite qualifications, opportunities are likely to be far narrower than their British counterparts.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"callaction\"><b>Chris Carter is chair of strategy and organisation at the University of Edinburgh Business School</b></p>\n<p class=\"callaction\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"callaction\"><b> Crawford Spence is professor of accounting at Warwick Business School</b></p>\n<p class=\"callaction\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"callaction\"><b>Claire Dambrin is associate professor in the management control department at ESCP Europe, Paris. </b></p>\n","layout":{"landscape":{"id":"am-dp1-layout1c","link":"story-landscape-layout1c.html"},"portrait":{"id":"am-dp1-layout2c","link":"story-portrait-layout1c.html"}},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":"","link_source":"","image":[],"url_alias":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com","type":"story","order":"24","folio_number":"0","folio_numbers":"","pdf_page_index":"0","thumbnail":null,"color":"e9ae00","real_id":"6083","main_section_id":"661","ads":[]},{"id":"e7c9fd83e44a4518bd3cf138ed9dd6b7","title":"Destination: Planet digital","sub_title":"","author":[{"id":"0","name":"Emily Black","email":"emily.black@progressivecp.com","is_default":false}],"tag":"","strap_line":"Stephen Daintith","short_intro":"DMGT's chief financial officer is steering the print giant online","intro":"At the helm of DMGT’s financial operation, Stephen Daintith is steering the print giant into the online world. He shows Adrian Holliday his vision for the future","body":"<p class=\"dropcap\">When it became clear in the mid-to-late 1990s that the Daily Mail and General Trust (DMGT) no longer wanted to rely on revenue from print publishing,  it was 50-year-old finance director Stephen Daintith FCA who was tasked with joint-piloting the digital navigation journey to the new media world.</p>\n<p>In the last five years DMGT has weaned itself off high-margin print advertising revenues, down from a total of 40% to 20%. Formulas for monetising content (or rather attention) are pored and picked over. The Mail is a past master of selling print ad space. “But,” Daintith says frankly, “selling digital advertising to a digital audience requires skills and an understanding of technology that, with respect to my print colleagues, are very different.” Not to mention figuring out what will be big in 2030 and beyond.</p>\n<p>Still, the massive international success of MailOnline – 166 million unique visitors a month – is a big achievement. But is it making cash? “We’re experimenting a lot with different advertising packages and with ecommerce,” says Daintith. One example is MailOnline photographs; some carry a small icon that a reader can click on, taking them direct to a retailer for whatever’s caught their eye – a dress, suit or bag for example.</p>\n<p>DMGT then takes a slice of the revenues for each transaction, somewhere between 5% and 12%. “These are the sort of ideas that I expect to see a lot more of in the future: how can we turn an engaged, interested audience into meaningful revenues for the company?” It’s the holy grail, of course, for modern media companies. Revenues are growing more than 50% a year and this year total revenues from MailOnline are expected to exceed £60m.</p>\n<p>Currently 43% of DMGT’s revenues and 64% of its profits come from outside the UK, an internationalism “that surprises most people who assume we’re all about the Daily Mail and little else”.</p>\n<p>DMGT is about investing in early stage businesses says Daintith, giving it the experience and readiness to take the long view, helped by the fact that it remains a family-controlled business. “We don’t chase short-term quarterly numbers; we understand that to create long-term sustainable business at times you need to be investing for the future rather than quickly getting to profit.”</p>\n<p>Daintith’s professional beginnings are rooted in the mid-1980s at Price Waterhouse (now PwC) – pre-digital times when a hand-written memo would be typed overnight and sent on.    Since then he’s done stints at the UK Civil Aviation Authority, been general manager of British American Tobacco (BAT) Bangladesh and Switzerland – he joined BAT in 1996 as an audit controller – and served as the CFO at Dow Jones &amp; Company.</p>\n<p>His early 30s were a turning point when he was made finance director at BAT South Africa. He was 32 and it was his first proper finance role – he had not been a financial controller before. “The finance director of a public company in Johannesburg was a big jump. I remember at one of the first AGMs a shareholder saying: ‘You’ve got a healthy cash balance on your balance sheet, what are you going to do with it?’ I answered something along the lines of ‘we’re going to place it on deposit and get a nice healthy return’. The shareholder retorted quick as a flash: ‘If that’s all you’re going to do, I can do a much better job and I think you should pay a special dividend’. It was a good learning experience in highlighting the stewardship role for optimising shareholder returns.”</p>\n<p>BAT South Africa snapped up Rothmans during this time, thanks to a roster of premium brands and less exposure to an increasingly litigious US market. “It was a terrific experience,” Daintith recalls. But the BAT Bangladesh sojourn, following two years in Pakistan, edged it. The vibrancy and colour of Dhaka, the Bangladeshi capital, amazed him. Daintith and his family lived in the prime minister’s house – rented to the tobacco giant. “We were the country’s largest taxpayer, paying around 7% of government revenues. Every chief exec before and after me had that house in the middle of Dhaka – a lovely house with mango and avocado trees.”</p>\n<p>Early on he wandered around the Dhaka factory, noticing the tatty clothes of many of the workers. “Bangladesh was the centre of the garment industry. I thought, how can this be? So we bought each of our garment workers three sets of uniforms with their names on them and they loved it.”</p>\n<p class=\"dropcap\">But the Dhaka stay brought a career low point when the Bangladeshi government rejected an excise tax structure, hitting short-term numbers. “I was the CEO and it meant a lot to me when our ideas were rejected by government policy and strategy, but you learn to live with that and move on.”</p>\n<p>It is all a long way from his current challenges: the digital business and investing in B2B firms, largely US-based. “We’re a portfolio business, a collection of a lot of different businesses all at different stages of evolution and business models, geographies and customers. It’s about delivering that potential.”</p>\n<p>Compared to the Murdoch empire, which targets big consumer media names, it’s a much more low-profile approach. One example is RMS – a risk modelling player generating revenues of $300m with a 30% operating margin – which has developed a software platform for the insurance industry, a new area for DMGT. The parent company also has a majority stake in Rightmove competitor Zoopla, an IPO hopeful for later this year.</p>\n<p>And yet, the biggest adventure is the future. MailOnline’s ad revenues climbed close to 50% at £14m in the last three months of 2013, helping see off a £1m print ad fall. Daintith claims the group is ahead of its target to hit £60m in revenues for this year. “The really exciting thing is developing new ways to make money out of that engagement,” he says. And that is a very big – and possibly lengthy – journey.</p>\n","layout":{"landscape":{"id":"am-dp1-layout17","link":"story-landscape-layout9.html"},"portrait":{"id":"am-dp1-layout18","link":"story-portrait-layout9.html"}},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":"","link_source":"","image":[{"id":"e8908192324ad41043f07ec862b2d63b","name":"member profile","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com/var/economia/storage/images/member-profile5/56548-1-eng-GB/member-profile_story_img_size_768x929.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"768","height":"929","is_default":true},{"id":"e8908192324ad41043f07ec862b2d63b","name":"member profile","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com/var/economia/storage/images/member-profile5/56548-1-eng-GB/member-profile_story_img_size_1024x673.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"1024","height":"673","is_default":false}],"url_alias":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com","type":"story","order":"25","folio_number":"0","folio_numbers":"","pdf_page_index":"0","thumbnail":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com/var/economia/storage/images/member-profile5/56548-1-eng-GB/member-profile_tablet_story_thumbnail.jpg","color":"e9ae00","real_id":"6085","main_section_id":"661","ads":[]}],"type":null,"ads":[]}}
