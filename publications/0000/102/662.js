They include:</p>\n<p>A Small Business, Enterprise and Employment Bill to make it easier for SMEs to get finance, give them fairer access to public sector contracts, and introduce higher penalties for those who fail to pay the minimum wage.</p>\n<p>National Insurance Contributions Bill to simplify the collection of class 2 NICs and boost anti-avoidance measures.</p>\n<p>Infrastructure Bill to facilitate fracking, speed up infrastructure projects and reform planning laws.</p>\n<p>Pensions Tax Bill to allow individuals access to defined contribution pension savings, open up the annuity market and bring in pensions anti-avoidance provisions.</p>\n<p>Private Pensions Bill to give employees more control over their pension funds.</p>\n<p>Serious Crime Bill to target people who knowingly participate in organised crime groups, including accountants facilitating money laundering.</p>\n<h2>AUDITOR AND AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORTS VARY IN VALUE</h2><p>A KPMG survey of the audit committee reports of the first 134 FTSE 350 companies to publish accounts under the new reporting regime has found wide variations.</p>\n<p>While the most common risks mentioned by audit committees were impairment, taxation, provisions and revenue recognition, the largest category after impairment risks was “other”, which appeared 38 times. A significant proportion of these were one-offs and often related to accounting judgements.</p>\n<p>KPMG also found major variations in the extended auditor reports. For example, there were good examples of disclosure of judgements and estimates corresponding to audit risks which were not only detailed on the nature of the subjective factors but also quantified as to sensitivity.</p>\n<p>However KPMG said, “This quality of disclosure was not universally available. In fact, around half of all cases saw some shortfall in matters disclosed by the accounts compared with the audit report.”</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.kpmg.com\" target=\"_self\">kpmg.com</a></p>\n<h2>NEW JOINT REVENUE RECOGNITION STANDARD</h2><p>The International Accounting Standards Board and the US Financial Accounting Standards Board have jointly issued a standard on revenue recognition.</p>\n<p>“Until now, there have been significant differences in how and when revenue has been recognised and reported under IFRS and US GAAP, which has made it difficult to compare reported revenues across companies, industries and capital markets,” said Nigel Sleigh-Johnson, head of ICAEW’s Financial Reporting Faculty.</p>\n<p>The standard will require companies to show the transfer of goods or services to customers in amounts that reflect the consideration the company expects to be entitled to in exchange. It will also lead to enhanced disclosure about revenue, give guidance for transactions not previously addressed comprehensively, and improve guidance for multiple-element arrangements.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ifrs.org.uk\" target=\"_self\">ifrs.org.uk</a></p>\n<h2>GUIDANCE ON SERVICE CHARGE EXPENDITURE</h2><p>ICAEW has issued a technical release setting out best practice in the conduct of a review engagement in the context of independent accountants’ reports on the annual statement of service charge expenditure   in commercial property.</p>\n<p>In the past there has been “widespread” inconsistency in the wording of these reports, which may have confused the occupiers of commercial properties as to what underlying procedures were performed and the level of assurance offered. The new guidance (TECH 09/14BL) should bring greater consistency to procedures and reporting and improve occupier satisfaction.</p>\n<p>It applies to reports on statements of service charge expenditure for periods starting on or after 1 April 2014, although earlier implementation is encouraged.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.icaew.com\" target=\"_self\">icaew.com</a></p>\n<h2>CYBER SECURITY ACCREDITATION LAUNCHED</h2><p>UK businesses will be able to gain accreditation for having cyber protection in place under a new government scheme. From 1 October the accreditation will be mandatory for suppliers bidding for government contracts covering sensitive and personal information handling.</p>\n<p>Industry feedback suggests many SMEs have been put off implementing cyber security plans because of time, costs and confusing advice from different bodies.</p>\n<p>The new scheme – Cyber Essentials – focuses on five essential mitigation strategies, providing clear guidance on implementation. The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills is also extending its voucher scheme so that businesses will be able to defray costs.</p>\n<p>BIS argues that accreditation provides a metric against which businesses can measure their cyber security maturity.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.gov.uk\" target=\"_self\">gov.uk</a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"callaction\"><b>To find more technical updates visit </b><a href=\"http://icaew.com/economia/technical\" target=\"_self\">icaew.com/economia/technical</a></p>\n","layout":{"landscape":{"id":"am-dp1-layout5a","link":"story-landscape-layout3a.html"},"portrait":{"id":"am-dp1-layout6a","link":"story-portrait-layout3a.html"}},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":"","link_source":"","image":[],"url_alias":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com","type":"story","order":"26","folio_number":"0","folio_numbers":"","pdf_page_index":"0","thumbnail":null,"color":"00a3d3","real_id":"6087","main_section_id":"662","ads":[]},{"id":"91d7badebf45c5628487eced7c311222","title":"Key developments","sub_title":"","author":[{"id":"0","name":"Emily Black","email":"emily.black@progressivecp.com","is_default":false}],"tag":"","strap_line":"Technical updates","short_intro":"","intro":"","body":"<h2><b>AUDIT</b></h2><h2>EU reforms need clarification</h2><p>Some businesses in Europe are still in the dark about implementation of the EU audit reforms despite publication of the legislation in the Official Journal (OJ).</p>\n<p>“There are still areas that require clarification and ICAEW is in regular contact with the government, firms and other stakeholders to identify those areas,” said Tony Bromell, head of integrity and markets at ICAEW.</p>\n<p>An explanatory memorandum was expected at the same time as the regulation and directive appeared in the OJ but has now been deferred until later in the year.</p>\n<p>Some of the more immediate questions revolve around the approaches different member states will take to the length of time they will allow before insisting on mandatory rotation of audit firms.</p>\n<p>The new EU law offers flexibility over rotation timing provided companies tender their audit every  10 years, so member states may opt to introduce different periods. The maximum for sole auditors can be extended to 20 years while in the case of a joint audit 24 years is allowed. Given the UK government’s current policy of deregulation, it seems likely it will exercise the most liberal option.</p>\n<p>Variation in timings could prove tricky for groups with headquarters and subsidiaries in different member states. It is also unclear about when rotation actually kicks in – there are specific transitional provisions for companies with the same auditors for a long time but, oddly, they are silent on when the provisions have effect for companies which have changed their auditor in the last 10 years.</p>\n<h2><b>EMPLOYMENT</b></h2><h2>EC ruling on commission pay</h2><p>Employers who pay commission on top of salaries to employees but do not include it in statutory holiday pay may find that they face claims for additional pay backdated to 1998, following a European Court decision.</p>\n<p>In Lock v British Gas, the court decided that the Working Time Directive (WTD) requires commission earned by staff to be taken into account when calculating holiday pay. Z J Lock, who was a British Gas sales consultant, took his employer to the Employment Tribunal because when he took his holidays, his salary dropped by some 40% because British Gas only gave him basic pay when he wasn’t earning commission.</p>\n<p>The tribunal forwarded the question of whether holiday pay should include commission under the WTD to the European Court. The court decided that as commission is intrinsically linked to performance of the activities the employee is obliged to perform under a contract of employment, the employer had to take it into account in calculating holiday pay.</p>\n<p>KPMG says that businesses may have to brace themselves for mass claims dating back to 1998 which was when the WTD was implemented in UK law.</p>\n<p>It also warns that the Lock case is “far from the end of the story. There is a clear direction of travel regarding holiday pay and employers with sizeable workforces, atypical working patterns and/or recurring variable elements of pay in particular need to be aware.</p>\n<p>“What is emerging as a rule of thumb is that if an employee  regularly takes home pay which is above his or her basic rate, that  needs to be considered in the holiday pay calculation.”</p>\n<p>As well as the increased wages bill, employers will have to negotiate with HMRC over the tax due on the backdated pay – which may well incur interest and penalties as well.</p>\n<h2><b>FINANCIAL REPORTING</b></h2><h2>FRC settles standards wrangle</h2><p>The Financial Reporting Council has put an end to the recent spat with a group of investors over the legality under UK law of using certain international accounting standards. It has issued a statement reconfirming that the presentation of a true and fair view remains a fundamental requirement of financial reporting.</p>\n<p>In the vast majority of cases, the regulator says, a true and fair view will be achieved by compliance with accounting standards and by additional disclosure to explain an issue fully. “However, where compliance with an accounting standard would result in accounts being so misleading that they would conflict with the objectives of financial statements, the standard should be overridden.”</p>\n<p>It adds that it will continue to discharge its responsibilities in relation to the monitoring and enforcement of reporting on that basis.</p>\n<h2>ICAEW calls for clarity on CCR</h2><p>ICAEW has written to the government to express serious concern about the proposals for implementing country-by-country reporting. It is worried about the wording of the final regulations, given the lack of clarity in certain parts of the underlying EU accounting directive, and it urges the government to pay attention to a number of areas including the impact on group companies and the problems over the requirement to report information on a cash basis when companies’ accounting systems are accruals-based.</p>\n<p>In the letter, ICAEW says that, while it strongly supports the government’s commitment to introduce transparency over payments made by companies to governments of resource-rich countries, “the regulation needs to be absolutely clear if it is to achieve its purpose”.</p>\n<p>It points to the proposed requirement that large companies involved in mining oil, minerals and gas or logging will have to produce an extractives report. This may cause “significant challenges” for many companies in collecting and collating relevant information.</p>\n<p>“Under the new rules, payments made to governments must be reported on a cash (rather than an accruals) basis,” it says. “This is not made sufficiently clear in the draft regulations. In our opinion, this is a critical point for companies to understand, not only because it will impact the figures reported but also because it is likely to represent a significant challenge when they start to collate the required information – company accounting systems are accruals based.”</p>\n<p>ICAEW thinks it likely that companies will have to introduce separate systems to account for the payments since normal accounting systems may not be able to deal with such reporting.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.icaew.com\" target=\"_self\">icaew.com</a></p>\n<h2>Consultation on investment entities</h2><p>The International Accounting Standards Board has issued for consultation proposed amendments to IFRS 10, Consolidated financial statements, and IAS 28, Investments in associates and join ventures.</p>\n<p>They are intended to clarify three issues about the application of the requirement for investment entities to measure subsidiaries at fair value instead of consolidating them.</p>\n<p>The deadline for comments on Investment entities – applying the consolidation exception – is 15 September 2014.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ifrs.org\" target=\"_self\">ifrs.org</a></p>\n<h2><b>IT</b></h2><h2>Improving spreadsheet practice</h2><p>The ICAEW IT Faculty has launched a major new publication on better spreadsheet thinking and practice.</p>\n<p>According to Twenty principles for good spreadsheet practice, around 90% of spreadsheets contain mistakes, ranging from minor to material errors such as incorrect models or careless use of formulae, often because 65% of Excel users are self-taught.</p>\n<p>“Many spreadsheets evolve over time without well-structured design or integrity checks and are poorly documented,” it says. “Making a relatively simple change can often take a long time, have unexpected consequences and/or result in errors from incorrect calculations or input assumptions.”</p>\n<p>The 20 principles are aimed at reducing spreadsheet risk and inefficiency in organisations both large and small. They are not comprehensive but focus on traditional formula-driven spreadsheet construction, and are intended to be widely applicable to “projects of all shapes and sizes and degrees of complexity”.</p>\n<p>The IT Faculty has also provided a resource page that contains the principles and an introductory film.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.icaew.com/Excel20Principles\" target=\"_self\">icaew.com/Excel20Principles</a></p>\n<h2><b>TAX</b></h2><h2>Service standards left wanting</h2><p>HMRC may have improved its service standards since they hit rock bottom three years ago but they are still not at acceptable levels, ICAEW has told exchequer secretary David Gauke.</p>\n<p>He has also been left in no doubt how Tax Faculty members feel  about HMRC chasing incorrect RTI liabilities and the proposed new power to collect tax debts direct  from bank accounts.</p>\n<p>Commenting on HMRC’s Q4 2013 performance statistics, the faculty described as “disappointing” the fact that overall telephone call performance had fallen by 5.4% when compared with Q4 2012. And while the number of telephone calls to HMRC contact centres handled within five minutes was up by 24.2% (v Q3 2013), this still meant a success rate of just 66.6%.</p>\n<p>The faculty wants to see an increase in front line staff answering phone calls at peak times of the year. HMRC’s plans to work towards handling 90% of calls across all helplines are welcome, it says, although the proposed level of at least 80% during 2014/15 is too low. This should be “at least 90% and ideally 95%”.</p>\n<p>On RTI, the faculty raised the issue that employers and their agents cannot see the same information online that HMRC can see relating to PAYE due and paid. This is “resulting in unnecessary and frustrating telephone calls when disputes arise”, says Paul Aplin, chairman of the faculty’s technical committee. “It is unhelpful to have a system in which employers are required to report PAYE in real time but in which  the PAYE information they can actually see online is only updated a couple of times a month.”</p>\n<p>Gauke was also told that the power to collect tax debts from bank accounts was “excessive” and bound to lead to mistakes with potentially serious consequences.</p>\n<h2>Close company loans reform dropped</h2><p>The government has announced that it will not go ahead with fundamental reform of the close company loan participators rules.</p>\n<p>Responses to the consultation last year made it clear that the options under consideration might impact badly on SMEs, wealth creation and on the UK economy.</p>\n<p>Instead, it says, HMRC will explore options for publishing a non-statutory form to reduce processing delays with claims for repayment, and continue to engage with interested parties to consider in more detail suggestions put forward during the consultation process which might result in smaller adjustments to the regime within its existing framework.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.gov.uk\" target=\"_self\">gov.uk</a></p>\n","layout":{"landscape":{"id":"am-dp1-layout5a","link":"story-landscape-layout3a.html"},"portrait":{"id":"am-dp1-layout6a","link":"story-portrait-layout3a.html"}},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":"","link_source":"","image":[],"url_alias":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com","type":"story","order":"27","folio_number":"0","folio_numbers":"","pdf_page_index":"0","thumbnail":null,"color":"00a3d3","real_id":"6089","main_section_id":"662","ads":[]},{"id":"d5e6d86c42e65ae3e5313e214bb6646b","title":"Inside job","sub_title":"","author":[{"id":"0","name":"Emily Black","email":"emily.black@progressivecp.com","is_default":false}],"tag":"","strap_line":"Insider trading","short_intro":"","intro":"Insider trading is a potential issue for all listed companies, not just those in the financial services sector. Caroline Biebuyck considers the risks and what accountants can do to minimise them","body":"<p class=\"dropcap\">Market abuse has made headlines in recent years with accusations of prices being rigged in markets ranging from Libor to oil. There has also been a substantial increase in reports of suspected insider dealing made to the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).     In late 2013 the FCA said it had received more than 1,000 suspicious transaction reports over its latest 12-month period, compared with 739 the year before.</p>\n<p>The increase is not necessarily seen as evidence of more misdeeds but of a greater awareness of what constitutes insider trading, and of its consequences. Much of this is due to the efforts of the FCA and its predecessor, the Financial Services Authority (FSA). Although insider dealing has been a crime for some time, the first criminal conviction was brought in 2008, the year in which the FSA issued its Code of Market Conduct. By March 2013 the regulator had secured 23 convictions.</p>\n<p>“With the regulator looking at insider trading more closely, and with the scale of fines ramping up, it is important for companies and financial institutions to take this seriously,” says Iain Coke, head of ICAEW’s Financial Services Faculty. “Insider trading is not a minor offence. It could inflict fatal damage to organisations, and people can go to jail.”</p>\n<p>Those working and associated with financial institutions should be well aware of the illegality and consequences of insider trading. However, some in business might not realise that the law extends beyond the finance industry to reach anyone who participates in or whose conduct affects the UK’s financial markets.</p>\n<p>Under the Criminal Justice Act 1993 the criminal offence of insider dealing covers the trading in any instrument traded on UK markets. And an inside trader does not have to be a company employee or contractor. “You don’t have to be an insider to be involved in insider dealing – you just have to know that what you know is inside knowledge,” says Ros Wright CB QC, chairman of the Fraud Advisory Panel.</p>\n<p>So what can companies do to prevent insider trading? A good starting place, says Coke, is to control who has access to insider information. “The fewer people who know about price-sensitive information, particularly mergers and acquisitions, the less chance there is that they will be able to trade based on this information,” he says.</p>\n<p>Compliance departments play a major role here. Normally senior management and directors need approval from compliance before trading in the company’s shares. Compliance should be told when price-sensitive information is around, and will keep a list of all those who they believe to have inside knowledge of corporate finance transactions.</p>\n<p>The FCA keeps an eye on unusual share price movements after previously confidential information, such as a takeover bid, has been released. “If the price or trading volumes moved significantly before the event, especially shortly before, then they will look into the transactions with the help of the compliance department,” says Coke.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"right\" ><span class=\"hide\">\"</span><p>“You don’t have to be an insider to be involved in insider dealing – you just have to know that what you know is inside knowledge”</p>\n<span class=\"hide\">\"</span></blockquote>\n<p>Organisations should educate their staff so they all know the rules governing trading in the company’s shares. While the FCA insists on these sorts of protocols in firms it regulates, non-regulated firms ought to have the same protocols in place. “You don’t have to be working in the financial services industry to be charged with insider dealing,” Wright emphasises. ICAEW contributed to the guidance for non-regulated firms, which is on the FCA’s website.</p>\n<p>Company insiders have to be careful that they don’t let the inside information out to others, even accidentally. “The question is whether everyone recognises the importance of confidentiality,” Coke says. “You need a culture that reinforces this.”</p>\n<p>Confidentiality is one of the five cornerstones of ICAEW’s Code of Ethics. The Code requires that members do not just keep information confidential but take all reasonable steps to preserve that confidentiality.</p>\n<p>Members are also under a professional obligation not to use confidential information to their own advantage and not to disclose it to others. “All our members in practice or business must be aware of this at all times,” says head of business law, Felicity Banks.</p>\n<p>ICAEW’s head of integrity and markets Tony Bromell points out that this can put members in business in an invidious position. “We are holding you to a standard while your organisation might not have the same standard,” he explains. He thinks members facing this dilemma should concentrate on selling the importance of ethics to the board as part of the business continuity strategy.</p>\n<p>“Chartered accountants  tend to be hard-nosed business types who can consider ethical behaviour, not just from the helps-you-sleep-better-at-night point of view, but also in the sense that it pays. Not being ethical can utterly destroy your reputation and the  company’s business.” </p>\n<p>A couple of years ago ICAEW commissioned researchers at Leeds University to look into what ethics really means in practice. The University’s professional ethics development officer Jim Baxter led the study, which included asking 92 business managers about their organisation’s approach to ethics at work.</p>\n<p>Baxter found a major part of having a truly ethical organisational culture rests  in making sure what is valued within the organisation accords with the messages from its leaders.</p>\n<p>“If you constantly talk about how important ethics  is but what gets people advanced is not abiding by the rules – so people can do well by not being ethical – then the organisation’s implicit values are not aligned with its explicit ones,” Baxter points out.</p>\n<p>If employees have a sense that something is wrong but want to talk through the matter with someone independent before taking action, ICAEW has a free and confidential advisory helpline members can use to discuss their concerns. “It also provides strong moral support for people who find themselves in a difficult position,” adds Banks. </p>\n<p>The Leeds University research highlighted the importance of having an open culture, a clear whistle-blowing policy and creating a net for catching issues before they become major problems. Training in ethics is vital –  as long as it is the right kind  of training.</p>\n<p>“Initially some people said training was counter-productive,” says Bromell. “When we dug into this we found a box-ticking approach to ethics was putting people off as this suggests you are just going through the motions. Ethics is about a mindset, a way of thinking and of behaving. Training that uses case studies about practical situations always engages people.”</p>\n<p>Members of professional bodies generally have an opportunity to act as champions in the organisations they work for, says Baxter.</p>\n<p>“ICAEW members undergo more ethics training than many other professionals so they should be relatively comfortable in talking about this. Perhaps they could see  it as their mission to spread this approach within the organisation.”</p>\n<div class=\"am_info_box\">\n\t<fieldset>\n\t<legend><div>CASE STUDY: A LEGAL BREAKTHROUGH FOR WHISTLEBLOWERS</div></legend>\n\t<div class=\"text\"><p>LLP partners will now be afforded protection under whistleblowing rules following a Supreme Court judgement made in May.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The landmark decision overturned a previous ruling that excluded partners from protection if they chose to expose wrongdoing at their own firm. The partners’ exclusion from the rule was based on a legal assumption that they are not “employees” in an LLP.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It followed a three-year case involving Krista Bates van Winkelhof, a law firm partner who sought to take complaints against the firm to an employment tribunal.  It was decided that as a partner she would not be protected under any whistleblowing laws, and this decision was upheld at a court of appeal. The Supreme Court unanimously allowed an appeal, and ruled that van Winkelhof is “a worker”.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The legal and accountancy professions welcomed the ruling, describing it as a turning point. Some argued that it will result in an increase in disclosures of wrongdoing.

Liz Loxton  looks at the work being done to prepare the ground","body":"<p class=\"dropcap\">IFRS 15 has had one of the longest incubation periods in the International Accounting Standard Board’s (IASB) immense standard setting endeavour. First flagged around 2004, the issue of how and when to recognise revenue in financial reporting has been passed back and forth many times before this year’s release of the standard in its final form.</p>\n<p>While the standard arguably will change little for many companies, it will have significant impact on a few. IASB board member Jan Engstrom says: “For 95% of companies, there is likely to be no change in the way they recognise revenue, which is a good outcome.”</p>\n<p>For listed companies, the first reporting period in which they will need to reflect the standard begins 1 January 2017 – providing a comfortable lead time, assuming companies put impact assessments and sensible preparations in train.</p>\n<h2>PRIVATE AND SMALLER COMPANIES</h2><p>Entities within the private company and SME sector   will be drawn in if they have voluntarily adopted IFRS, perhaps because they are a subsidiary of a larger group.</p>\n<p>In cases like these, says Nigel Sleigh-Johnson, head of ICAEW’s Financial Reporting Faculty, preparers are likely to be able to avail themselves of the examples and resources of their parent companies.</p>\n<p>The trickle down to UK GAAP will be some way off as 1 January 2018 seems the earliest possible date, and so far the IASB says it has no plans to incorporate the principles of the new standard into IFRS for SMEs.</p>\n<p>“This is currently not a big issue for private companies, but eventually these requirements may become a feature of UK GAAP,” says Sleigh-Johnson. “Ultimately, this might become the basis of revenue recognition in UK GAAP for private companies, but there may be an element of simplification.”</p>\n<p>In the meantime, the issues for smaller, non-listed entities that need to apply the standard are broadly the same as for listed companies, says Engstrom. IFRS should not present more of a problem here. “Smaller companies are generally more focused businesses. And we have tried to be as pragmatic as possible,” he says.</p>\n<p>So advisers and preparers within SMEs and the private company sector would do well to see how the impacts play out for listed companies and take note of the preparatory work that goes  into assessing contracts, particularly those within the telecoms and IT sectors.</p>\n<p>Tessa Park, technical and training partner at Kingston Smith, says the long lead time for the standard gives plenty of scope for firms to get to grips with the main differences between the new standard and current requirements.</p>\n<p>The most significant issues that firms and their clients will need to consider will be determining whether a contract has different elements and when revenue should be recognised for each element. “The new standard focuses on when the customer obtains control of the goods or services supplied to determine when revenue is recognised,” she says.</p>\n<p>Here again, there will be many cases where preparers won’t need to change things. “For simple sales of goods this will probably achieve the same result as the current requirements, but it may well not where contracts have multiple elements or are performed over a longer period of time,” Parks says.</p>\n<p>“These are the areas of the new standard on which firms will therefore need to focus their training because, as is so often the case, the devil is in the detail.”</p>\n<h2>CONTRACT REVIEWS</h2><p>The telecoms industry has become something of a poster child for IFRS 15, but any organisation that offers complex bundles of goods and services may need to unpick its usual approach.</p>\n<p>“Companies that bundle together goods and services will need to unbundle them for the purposes of accounting and apportion revenue to the elements,” says Sleigh-Johnson.</p>\n<p>While contracts and approaches differ widely from company to company, where a phone company offers a free phone along with a contract lasting two years at £25 pcm, typically, it will book simply the £25 pcm as revenue and ignore the cost of the phone.</p>\n<p>“Under the new standard, you would ask ‘what is the standalone value of the phone?’ and allocate an appropriate proportion of the total revenue to it. You’re going to reflect the economic reality rather than the cash flow,” he says.</p>\n<p>Approaches to this issue just within the telecom sector have varied widely, says Engstrom. “Where companies offer a phone without charge along with a service contract, they have considered the phone as an expense, without value to the customer. We have said that there are two elements with value.”</p>\n<p>That upfront revenue recognition may be more significant where companies offer a discounted high-end phone, and clearly these kinds of instances also occur within the IT sector where contracts commonly include hardware, implementation, upgrades and maintenance, and companies in this sector may also see significant changes in their revenue recognition profiles.</p>\n<p>What’s more, the standard is broadly retrospective, so companies will need to restate the prior years. “If you have many thousands of contracts, particularly if they are not standard contracts, that is challenging, which is why we have a long lead time,” says Sleigh-Johnson.</p>\n<p>Within the debate around the standard as it evolved, there have been operational concerns around just how straightforward identifying and valuing those performance obligations within contracts will be in practice. And since the final version favours the IASB’s principle-led approach over US GAAP’s heavily detailed and granular version, this remains an area where account preparers will      need help.</p>\n<p>The IASB says the final principle-based version makes sense in the face of the huge variance of styles of contract across different industries. “This is a standard that will hopefully cover a wider range of transactions.</p>\n<p>“It doesn’t rely on the different applications of revenue accounting for users in the US or others affected by US GAAP; there will be a lot of situations where good judgement will prevail,”    says Engstrom.</p>\n<p>“The standard includes basic principles; you divide delivery into separate performance obligations. If you are looking at a building contract, of course, you can see the border between the different elements,” he says.</p>\n<p>The IASB will be assembling a discussion group to build guidance and best practice and to address questions as the profession begins to grapple with this particular issue.</p>\n<p>processes and systems</p>\n<p>“There will be some significant training issues,” says Sleigh-Johnson. “There will be a need to educate not just financial people, but people right across the organisation.”</p>\n<p>And training is far from the only impact when considering what, for most accounts users, is the first port of call when assessing a company’s performance. The practical issues that cascade down from changes to what is, for many, the headline indicator of company performance  are legion.</p>\n<p>Organisational and systems issues such as the need to invest or modify IT systems should be high up the operational agenda. Changes to accounting systems will also need to reflect changing forecasts around revenue, sales forecasts and tax payments. The new requirements may force real changes in business practices, including a reassessment of sales forecasts and KPIs. The need to communicate those changes and their knock-on effects will have to be acknowledged up front.</p>\n<p>“Where you are talking about an impact on net profit, that translates into something that may affect bonus calculations, for example,” says Sleigh-Johnson. “And there is no doubt that there will be tax implications when recognising a lot of possible revenue upfront for the first time. The new standard may throw new light on business practices. All that will take  a good deal of time to evaluate and discussion will have to go up to board level.”</p>\n<h2>DISCLOSURES</h2><p>One aspect of the new standard that has drawn concern is the level of disclosures it involves. An IASB spokesman says that, after extensive consultation, the board has tried to reduce the burden on preparers without diminishing the usefulness of the information in the financial statements.</p>\n<p>But it is an area that firms and preparers should not overlook, says Sleigh-Johnson. “It’s interesting that, at a time when we have debate on whether the current level  of disclosures is helpful or not, here we have a standard that increases disclosure. Challenges of actually implementing the disclosures for IFRS 15 should not be underestimated.”</p>\n<p>He adds: “It really is one to start looking at sooner rather  than later.”</p>\n","layout":{"landscape":{"id":"am-dp1-layout5","link":"story-landscape-layout3.html"},"portrait":{"id":"am-dp1-layout6","link":"story-portrait-layout3.html"}},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":"","link_source":"","image":[{"id":"def07e91dbd6fb9d98c87ebe5b167252","name":"Revenue Recognition","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com/var/economia/storage/images/revenue-recognition/56342-1-eng-GB/revenue-recognition_story_img_size_708x442.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"708","height":"442","is_default":true},{"id":"def07e91dbd6fb9d98c87ebe5b167252","name":"Revenue Recognition","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com/var/economia/storage/images/revenue-recognition/56342-1-eng-GB/revenue-recognition_story_img_size_472x438.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"472","height":"438","is_default":false}],"url_alias":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com","type":"story","order":"29","folio_number":"0","folio_numbers":"","pdf_page_index":"0","thumbnail":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com/var/economia/storage/images/revenue-recognition/56342-1-eng-GB/revenue-recognition_tablet_story_thumbnail.jpg","color":"00a3d3","real_id":"6093","main_section_id":"662","ads":[]},{"id":"56c30579c5023f3ce45ac49baa190567","title":"Should I stay or should I go?","sub_title":"","author":[{"id":"0","name":"Emily Black","email":"emily.black@progressivecp.com","is_default":false}],"tag":"","strap_line":"Career planning","short_intro":"","intro":"When planning your accountancy career, whether to go long term or short stay is a crucial decision. Rachel Fielding weighs up the pros and cons of parking it","body":"<p class=\"dropcap\">When accountancy trainee Simon Michaels joined BDO in 1987 after completing his A-levels, it was the start of a 17-year career at the mid-tier firm that took him all the way to managing partner. As a long-termer, Michaels is in good company: PwC chairman and senior partner Ian Powell joined the UK firm as a graduate trainee in 1977 and former KPMG chairman John Griffith-Jones enjoyed a career spanning 37 years there.</p>\n<p>The so-called job for life may have all but disappeared in the corporate world – analyst Mintel found that younger workers in particular are more likely to have had several employers over the past five years – but across the accountancy sector, examples of successful individuals who worked their way up the corporate ladder in one firm are well documented.</p>\n<p>For those planning their career onslaught – including those from Generation Y perhaps unfairly criticised for their inability to stick things out – the question is, have the rules of engagement changed since Michaels’s rise to the top? What are the benefits and disadvantages of staying with a firm long-term over moving around to gain experience; and does one approach give ambitious accountants the edge over the other when it comes to achieving success?</p>\n<p>Perhaps in contrast to the industry side of the fence, where those staying put may be labelled unambitious, remaining with a practice isn’t coloured with the same preconceptions. “If anything, people are seen as being more ambitious if they stay to get promoted to partner,” says Heather Townsend, executive coach and author of How to make partner and still have a life.</p>\n<h2>EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE </h2><p>Forging a successful career appears far more dependent on EQ – emotional intelligence – than IQ. Getting the right work exposure is critical, so remaining to exploit the power of a strong internal network is not to be sniffed at. “Within practice, sponsors and mentors are absolutely critical because they dictate the right exposure to the right clients,” says Mark Freebairn, head of the financial management practice at search firm Odgers Berndtson. “Trading your network to move to a firm where no one knows you from Adam is a brave career step.”</p>\n<p>But sometimes a move outside the company makes absolute sense. Despite their scale and breadth, those who start their careers in the Big Four may find that it is actually quite difficult to satisfy a desire for a broad range of business experiences within one firm. This is in part due to the narrow and deep training that has increasingly become the norm at the largest firms, not to mention the politics of internal moves (see box).</p>\n<p>“You see a lot of CVs of Big Four people circulating around and then dropping to the mid tier because they’ve exhausted their Big Four options,” Townsend explains. Skills not as in demand at the Big Four are desirable in the mid tier and could be enough to put candidates on the partnership track. “They’re looking at what business development currency you’d bring with you, whether it’s clients, technical speciality or networks you’ve built up that they can exploit quickly,” Townsend adds.</p>\n<p>If it’s specific business expertise you’re after, an industry placement may be preferable to a move to a smaller firm in order to tick the box. While emulating the success of Margaret Ewing, who returned to Deloitte following board-level positions at BAA and Trinity Mirror, may be an unrealistic objective, the opportunities for six- to nine-month secondments are plentiful, Freebairn maintains.</p>\n<p>Even though firms are in the middle of a war for talent, becoming partner is not an automatic rite of passage. “One of the disadvantages of staying in a firm is that there may not be an opening for partner. It took one person I know eight years at director level before she made it to partner,” explains Townsend. </p>\n<h2>DEVELOPING SKILLS</h2><p>Not everyone is convinced that being a lifer in a firm is the best strategy for career development. “I don’t think it’s possible to stay in the same firm to develop the skills you need to be a successful partner,” says Stephen Quest, an independent tax advisor and former Grant Thornton partner who sat on GT’s partner appointment panel.</p>\n<p>Sticking it out in one firm, Quest argues, doesn’t give you enough opportunity to develop the broad skills you need to be a successful partner, such as an entrepreneurial approach and the ability to communicate effectively with clients.</p>\n<p>At the same time, employment patterns across the profession are shifting, says Robert Holland, managing partner, who is responsible for HR at regional firm James Cowper: “There are far fewer lifers than there ever were,” he says. Of James Cowper’s 14 partners, just one has been with the firm all the way through. “A serial career is much more normal than it was when I started.”</p>\n<p>It’s a sentiment echoed by Hazel Garvey, director of business development at ICAEW. “For a lot of students coming through now, there’s not a natural feeling that they’ll stay anywhere for a long time. It’s difficult to get them to think long term.”</p>\n<blockquote class=\"right\" ><span class=\"hide\">\"</span><p>“Ask the partners which divorce they’re on – it’s a good gauge of stress levels at the firm”</p>\n<span class=\"hide\">\"</span></blockquote>\n<p>Moving around from employer to employer when you’ve qualified isn’t going to hold your career back, as long as the choices you make allow you to gain the right experiences to meet your ultimate career objectives, Garvey says. Devising a roadmap and planning your strategy involves a fair amount of soul searching. And yet career management is often neglected. “Where do you see yourself in five years’ time?” may be the ultimate career cliché, but for ambitious accountants it’s an essential question to ask of yourself.</p>\n<h2>SWITCHING TEAMS</h2><p>“The benefit of switching employer is you can move at the pace of your career rather than the pace of the firm’s growth,” Townsend says. You need to make sure the firm you go to is the right cultural fit, or that could hamper your career development.</p>\n<p>“A high-stress, long-hours culture isn’t necessarily a problem as long as you can cope with it but it’s best to be forewarned. Are people smiling? Ask the partners which divorce they’re on. It’s a good gauge of stress levels at the firm.”</p>\n<p>A couple of strategic lateral moves to other firms can certainly be beneficial, particularly early in your career. “There’s a lot of grunt work in the early stages of an accountancy career. So leaving behind a reputation, good or bad, and starting with a clean sheet of paper in a new firm can be a good thing,” Townsend says.</p>\n<p>Natalie Greenway, who is development manager at Baker Tilly, admits that changing firms can help fast-track a promotion by bypassing the often onerous internal assessment and development processes.</p>\n<p>“It’s easier to go in direct  as a partner rather than being promoted internally.” But she makes no excuses for the firm’s rigorous approach to development. “A lot of people put pressure on the time it takes to get a promotion rather than focusing on whether they are properly equipped for the role.” </p>\n<p>But Freebairn warns that a decision to move from the Big Four to a mid-tier firm should not be taken lightly. “You can step down in size to get the promotion, but you have to be comfortable that it’s a long-term move,” he says.</p>\n<p>In football terms, if you’re Wayne Rooney and leave Manchester United to join Cambridge United for two years, and then want to play with a big team again, you could find Barcelona won’t touch you with a barge pole.</p>\n<p>Despite a 28-year career with the firm, Liz Bingham, EY’s managing partner, talent, admits there isn’t a model route. “I stuck it out because I was given lots of opportunities to do lots of different things under the banner of one employer. Others will have  to look outside for the opportunities.”</p>\n<p>The good news is that if you do decide to leave, you won’t be left with a black mark by your name, particularly among the Big Four, which boasts the highest number of ‘boomerangs’ – staff who leave and then return to the firm – across the profession. EY’s global chairman and CEO, Mark Weinberger, has left and come back four times.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless Bingham urges individuals to stay put until they have exhausted all opportunities for progression within a firm. And if you do leave, it’s important not to burn any bridges. “Be very clear to yourself and others about why you’re leaving and how it will benefit you. Don’t assume that everyone understands your ambitions.”</p>\n<p>All of this could be academic, if research into the future of work is anything to go by. Changes in technology and communications are predicted to result in an elite of “gold collar” workers boasting deep technical specialisms and broader business skills. “Career progression won’t be the norm. It will be about more flexible working and different roles. Already there’s a lot less linear expectation,” explains accountant Carol McLachlan, an 18-year veteran of EY and now a business coach.</p>\n<p>Whether you stay or go, McLachlan says it’s about having a strong supporting case, owning your career and making it work for you. “The correlation with success will come from emotional intelligence. Have a clear strategy and play to your strengths.”</p>\n<div class=\"am_info_box\">\n\t<fieldset>\n\t<legend><div>“NARROW AND DEEP” AT THE BIG FOUR</div></legend>\n\t<div class=\"text\"><p>The increasing complexity of the UK’s tax system has led to individuals forging narrow and deep specialisms across niche areas of accounting, particularly in the largest firms. The flip side is that it can prevent them from gaining the breadth of experiences that so many desire.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Liz Bingham, managing partner, talent, at EY admits that recruits at the firm “get trained to within an inch of their lives within a deep technical area”. But despite the huge breadth of potential opportunities offered by Big Four firms, the politics of moving from one department to another can be extremely, if surprisingly, problematic.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In response to this, EY is launching its Talent Centre, offering careers advice to newly qualified staff at the firm. “Our objective is to harness the power of the firm to enable individuals to broaden their experiences.

But it can’t afford to stay rooted to the spot, as partner Martin Atkins tells Xenia Taliotis","body":"<p class=\"dropcap\">Harris Lipman prides itself on building long-lasting relationships with its clients and its team. Martin Atkins, the north London firm’s managing partner, has worked there for 20 years, while two other partners, Barry Lewis and Ashok Shah, have clocked up 47 and 29 years respectively. They have a way to go before they catch up with their most loyal clients, some of whom have been with the practice since it was set up in 1954 by Solomon (known as Syd) Lipman.</p>\n<p>Solid personal relationships have underpinned the firm from the start. “It was one of the things that most attracted me when I came on board in 1994,” says Atkins. “Seeing how happy everyone seemed, and how well they got on was a powerful incentive to join.”</p>\n<p>The other factor that drew Atkins was the firm’s way of doing business. Sixteen years after Lipman’s death in 1998, the standards he set are still in force. “Syd was all about personal service,” says Atkins.</p>\n<p>“So, for instance, all our customers get a card on their birthday, and if they take the trouble to come to our office, then we’ll clean their car.” Putting such thought into its customer relations has helped the firm win, among other prizes, a WOW Award for client service, based purely on their recommendations.</p>\n<p>“Syd wanted his firm to stand for integrity and excellence,” says Atkins. “If you keep those two factors in mind in all your dealings, you can’t go far wrong.”</p>\n<p>Responsibility for producing excellent work with integrity lies with the Harris Lipman team, currently numbering nine partners and 48 staff. Recruitment rests at a healthy three to four new members a year, and people join at all levels, most often as graduates, but also as senior managers or occasionally even as partners. Recently,  the firm also took on its first ever apprentice.</p>\n<p>Everyone works hard but is well-rewarded, not only financially but also with ‘softer’ benefits; there are regular social events, while the Solomon Lipman Memorial Prize, awarded each year to the most outstanding team member, also includes a £1,000 donation to the winner’s favourite charity.</p>\n<p>Training is key: Harris Lipman spends £70,000 a year on courses and professional qualifications including ACAs, ATTs, JIEBs and ACCAs, and all staff have a clearly-defined career structure with set goals and timelines. Without realistic targets, says Atkins, people tend to drift, or to end up disappointed. “We promote people when they are ready for the next step. Eight of our nine partners are home-grown; they’ve all completed our Path to Partnership Programme, which trains up any managers we think have the potential to lead the firm in the future.”</p>\n<blockquote class=\"right\" ><span class=\"hide\">\"</span><p>“If clients take the trouble to come to our office, then we’ll clean their car”</p>\n<span class=\"hide\">\"</span></blockquote>\n<p>The scheme is crucial to Harris Lipman’s succession planning: those enrolled typically take between three and four years to complete it, which means the process of having the right people in place to safeguard the firm’s future is ongoing.</p>\n<p>The other major investment is technology. Harris Lipman uses remote access and secure document exchange systems, telephone and video conferencing, and Cloud technology to stay in touch with clients.</p>\n<p>“Technology has revolutionised the way we do business,” says Atkins. “It saves us a lot of time and money because we don’t have to travel to meet clients face to face, and it also makes us available outside office hours.</p>\n<p>“There’s a new generation of clients coming through our doors with an ‘always-on’ mentality; they expect their service providers – their accountants included – to provide answers when they need them; we can no longer afford to stop the clock at five.”</p>\n<p>Harris Lipman took a hit during the recession, when its turnover dropped from £5.5m to today’s £4.8m. This was down to clients curtailing their discretionary spend rather than taking their business elsewhere, but the loss in revenue gave the firm the push it needed to look at its own overheads. “We had to find ways of saving money, not just for ourselves but also for our clients,” says Atkins.</p>\n<p>“In 2008 we decided to outsource our account preparation and bookkeeping to India. We were completely upfront with our clients about our plans. Many of them appreciated that this was the only way we could continue to offer them the standard of service they were used to without raising our fees.”</p>\n<p>The process, he says, is seamless – the eight-person team in India does the essential number crunching and data processing – and then sends the files electronically to London for checking and filing.</p>\n<p>The vast majority of Harris Lipman’s 1,000 or so clients are owner-managed businesses from diverse backgrounds. Insolvency accounts for 40% of revenue and the other 60% comes from tax, audit and businesses services, including start-up, consolidation and expansion, and retirement and estate planning.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"right\" ><span class=\"hide\">\"</span><p>“Probate work will tie in very well with the deep knowledge of client assets we have already”</p>\n<span class=\"hide\">\"</span></blockquote>\n<p>Harris Lipman has always been known for its insolvency work and the firm has dealt with some headline-making liquidations, including Our Price and Watkins Books. The curious thing is, the recession brought not an increase in business but a dip. “Our revenue from liquidations dropped from 50% to 40% post 2008,” says Atkins.</p>\n<p>“We were expecting bankruptcies to jump up, as they had during other recessions, but they didn’t. The difference between this one and others is that HMRC and the banks have taken a much softer stance this time. Normally they’d be straight in there, forcing zombie companies into liquidation but instead they’re allowing them to carry on trading.”</p>\n<p>And he doesn’t think this will change when interest rates go up. “Logic tells me that a hike in interest rates will bring down any companies that are just treading water. But my hunch is that there will be sufficient government help, and help from the banks, to keep them going. If I am wrong, we’re well prepared to expand on that front. We have the expertise to save failing businesses, or, if that’s not possible, to make the insolvency relatively painless.”</p>\n<p>Harris Lipman is currently putting two people through the licence probate process to expand its portfolio of services. “Probate work will tie in very well with what we do already,” says Atkins. “We already have a deep knowledge of our clients’ assets, based on all the tax work we do for them, so it’s a natural next step to then be able to take their estates through probate.”</p>\n<p>The firm also remains open to other opportunities, including further acquisitions. “In 1998 we acquired an insolvency practice in Cardiff, which has worked very well for us. You have to be willing to hear people out. Over the years we’ve had several approaches from other firms wanting to merge with us,  but none has been quite right.  But who’s to say what will happen next week, or next month, or next year?</p>\n<p>“Accountancy is just like any other business – if you stand still for too long you’ll eventually wither away.”</p>\n<div class=\"am_info_box\">\n\t<fieldset>\n\t<legend><div>THE FIRM AT A GLANCE</div></legend>\n\t<div class=\"text\">\n<div class=\"\"><div class=\"hide gallery\">\n<ul><li>94c3163031bbd4db7e09a1c3072a8eb5</li><li>b3d3a2e81cb3c12badb2f3b128cd7dde</li><li>2bd30d0828b7410d2df5f316dd6c253d</li><li>fc5d37078d87b16aa62fa89b8fafba78</li><li>a2dbd170021b4ce6d5cd296be7832ee1</li><li>7416140d10399c7d1217f665c569b2f4</li></ul>\n</div></div><p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Following the London 2012 Olympics, Harris Lipman set up the Harris Lipman Foundation to help fund Olympic Legacy projects in schools, clubs and associations throughout the UK.

Intuit","short_intro":"","intro":"How will accountancy evolve in a changing world, and what values need to be retained? ICAEW’s Practice Committee, together with software company Intuit, has launched a project to uncover the major challenges ahead","body":"<p class=\"dropcap\">There’s an issue that has come to light since the global recession of 2008 that should be of concern to small and medium-sized accountancy practices – over-capacity. A recent survey by ICAEW showed 69% of practices needed more clients. And when SMPs need more clients, they’re inclined to compete on fees, which has a potentially negative effect on quality.</p>\n<p>As Peter Hollis, chairman, ICAEW Practice Committee, and practitioner from Sheffield says: “Quality will be eroded if practices are forced to compete on cost, especially in a market where compliance services are shrinking, regulation is onerous and technology has become more efficient.”</p>\n<p>It is for this reason that ICAEW Practice Committee and Intuit have launched a campaign to ensure that the UK accountancy profession prospers into the future. Which economic trends and drivers will affect firms and their clients up to 2025? And how should SMPs develop new services to stay ahead of the game? A recent Birmingham roundtable gathered accountancy professionals from a range of backgrounds for discussion.</p>\n<h2>TOMORROW'S WORLD</h2><p>“The challenge is that the people we are recruiting and training need to be more than just auditors – they will need other skill sets as well as the audit market declines,” said Helen Drew, partner, Crowe Clark Whitehill. “As partners, we have that skill set. But people that we’re taking on will need to do both in future, earlier.” So how are accountants being trained to bring a second role to an already demanding job? Many simply aren’t – which is a considerable training issue.</p>\n<p>ICAEW president Arthur Bailey said: “Training to give advice and how it can be incorporated into the training of future chartered accountants is something to take on board. The ability largely comes through the practice itself, perhaps by younger people sitting alongside experienced professionals. It’s very difficult to train people to give advice. More and more, we’re going to be advisers rather than technicians.”</p>\n<p>And in order to give advice you need experience and not just the experience of your own specialism. But there will always be a need for some to simply be a steady pair of hands in specialisms such as tax, audit, VAT, payroll, business strategy or regulation. </p>\n<h2>NEW BLOOD</h2><p>Darren Holdway, managing partner, Haines Watts, added: “With graduates coming through, you’ve got to start with the fundamentals. What does a good relationship look like? What is empathy? What is intellectual curiosity about a business? What are the drivers for the owners of the business? Those are all things we’ve absorbed through osmosis over 20 or 30 years. But for those kids, somehow some of that has to be fast-tracked or they’re going to give advice from a poor platform.”</p>\n<blockquote class=\"right\" ><span class=\"hide\">\"</span><p><b>“You need someone who is sitting with the client, who can relate to that person – who knows what the client is talking about”</b></p>\n<p>HARVEY OWEN, NICKLINS</p>\n<span class=\"hide\">\"</span></blockquote>\n<p>And it can be quite a broad platform. As Chris Barlow, managing director of Bloomer Heaven said, “Look at the firms who are being served by it. There’s a difference between a sole practitioner and a relatively big firm and what they both want from the profession. It’s that one-size-fits-all conundrum. There needs to be a way of segmenting part of it, or specialising. If I take on someone who’s been trained by the Big Four, it’s almost useless to my practice, because many of the skills they have are not relevant to my firm.”</p>\n<p>\nSo there are substantial training issues. But nobody should underestimate the huge amount of loyalty and desire to join networks, added Mandy Mitten, managing director of Mitten Clarke, “A lot of people are absolutely desperate to gain advisory skills,” she said. <br /> “I wonder if ICAEW could commit more to a development programme in this area?”</p>\n<p>She was especially keen for something aimed at “the foot soldiers of the profession, many in their 40s and 50s”. These people were originally trained to prepare accounts, to be methodical and precise. “But now,” said Mitten, “we’re expecting them to become something quite different and that can be very tough.”</p>\n<h2>LOOK SMART</h2><p>Meanwhile, the nature of audit is definitely changing and that change, said Oliver Ross, partner, Muras Baker Jones, is making its presence felt, right across the UK. “You may get concentrations or clusters of auditors in the future at the smaller end,” he said. “But really it’s about getting smarter with your business offering, realising that this is something fundamental you’re doing with your business on a day-to-day level. At my firm at partner level, that’s where we spend much of our time, not over-burdened by technical compliance issues.”</p>\n<p>Of course, packaging up a range of services is now increasingly important for many practices, mindful that they need to extract sufficient value for their advice. It’s also important that the client appreciates, in turn, the value of the advice given. But they’re also increasingly demanding and expectant, said Geoff Thompson, business development manager at Intuit. They need to see service breadth. Thompson said that 70% of the accountants they recently surveyed expect to move away from offering compliance services to be the complete business strategic adviser.</p>\n<p>It’s a claim that Spencer Wright, chief executive, Dains, immediately recognised. “The separation and packaging of these services is definitely the way forward in order to deliver both quality and value. There should be zero tolerance for doing stuff you shouldn’t. Our clients now come to Dains for our advisory services as much as anything else.”</p>\n<h2>GENERAL PARTNER ANYONE?</h2><p>So what do some of the changing forces mean for the specialism of general partner? “A practice of my size needs it,” said Harvey Owen, managing partner of Nicklins. “You need someone who is sitting with the client who can relate to that person – who knows what the client is talking about. He can then go away and find the people to do the work. That point should be a specialism.”</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote class=\"right\" ><span class=\"hide\">\"</span><p><b>“We need to be agile and up for change, because the profession in five years will look different”</b></p>\n<p>DAVID MUNTON, GRANT THORNTON</p>\n<span class=\"hide\">\"</span></blockquote>\n<p>Perhaps, but the skills required to be good at the generalism are changing. “The average client doesn’t necessarily want specialists at the highest level. They simply want people who understand their business,” said Grant Thornton managing partner David Munton. </p>\n<h2>CHARTERED CHANGE</h2><p>Richard Harwood of Sutton Coldfield-based Harwoods agreed. A lot of his clients are simply interested in making sure their tax return is done correctly. “I don’t know if you call payrolls and VAT compliance work or not, but in our practice there is a huge demand for getting that right. So there’s definitely still a market for compliance work.”</p>\n<p>There also remains a huge market for very specialised consultancy – the sort of consultancy that can chip away at the core base of your own services; something Owen warned about: “I get approached by six or seven consultants a week, all of which can do something allegedly wonderful. Whether it’s an issue of taxation or R&amp;D, auto enrolment. Whenever something new happens, someone else becomes a consultant. At the moment that’s just a start of what could become a groundswell. That’s where we’re going to have to really look. The Big Four have the stability of their size, we don’t.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile commoditisation and the increased use of technology to deliver a service are being adopted fast by the same large players – particularly in terms of audit, says Munton. And that, inevitably, has to trickle down to the smaller players longer term. “A couple of thousand procedures that might have been performed on site are now being performed in the back-office. So you don’t need chartered accountants to do that. The use of a chartered accountant for a typical audit is changing.”</p>\n<h2>A VERY CONFIDENT FUTURE</h2><p>But the group agreed it is easy to under-estimate the speed of technological change. Five years ago Twitter didn’t exist. Now, about 70% of people attending the roundtable were likely to have Tweeted, according to Intuit’s Thompson. What’s more, clients not only expect you to provide a service fit for their 21st century needs, but one that is also ahead of the technological curve.</p>\n<p>The discussion was passionate and forthright. But overwhelmingly, most around the conference table remained highly optimistic about the future. Harwood certainly was and he was particularly positive about ICAEW’s role within it. “I’ve been involved with the Institute for more than 20 years. The way ICAEW has changed over that period is really quite remarkable: how the brand has been managed, how the marketing has changed. If we take on-board some of the comments made around the table today, that can only improve.”</p>\n<p>But Munton added a last warning shot. “We need to be agile and we need to be up for the change. Because what the profession is going to look like in five years time is going to be fundamentally different to what it is now.”</p>\n\n<div class=\"object-right factbox\">\n<table bgcolor=\"#eeeeee\">\n<tr>\n    <td>\n    <div class=\"text\"><h2>ABOUT TOMORROW'S PRACTICE</h2><p>The Tomorrow’s Practice project will cover key themes such as global economic trends, regulatory forces and technology and business change.</p>\n<p>It aims to explore how technology changes the way businesses require information, altering how they meet regulatory change, and also how being on the move and having instant access to real time information becomes a critical factor in how practices serve their clients.

He did not turn up to the DCT hearing and, in his absence, the tribunal found the charge proved. He was severely reprimanded, fined £3,500 and ordered to pay costs assessed at £1,275.</p>\n<p>Leach appealed. He argued that the tribunal had been wrong to refuse his written application for an adjournment on the grounds of ill health, and that the complaint to which the investigation committee letter referred would ultimately have proved to be unjustified.</p>\n<p>Before the DCT hearing, he emailed to ask for an adjournment and sent a copy of a letter from his consultant cardiologist to his doctor, reporting his ill health. However, the letter did not suggest that his medical condition made him unfit to attend a disciplinary hearing, nor did he produce any further medical evidence. The hearing went ahead.</p>\n<p>\nThe appeal committee panel consulted Hamer’s Professional Conduct Casebook, which includes decisions by judges when reviewing refusals by disciplinary tribunals to grant adjournments on medical grounds. In Awan v The Law Society, the then Master of the Rolls, Lord Phillips, wrote: “If medical reasons are advanced, the tribunal may well require production of a medical report or certificate in support of the application. If a report or certificate is produced, <br /> the tribunal is entitled to consider whether it sufficiently supports the reason of the adjournment that is relied upon. It is not obliged… to grant the application to adjourn simply because a medical certificate is produced, whatever its content.”</p>\n<p>As for Leach’s second grounds for appeal – that the complaint against him would have been dismissed in due course – the panel said: “It was for the investigation committee to decide whether the complaint was well-founded, not for the appellant to try to pre-empt that decision by refusing to co-operate.”</p>\n<h2>KINGSTON SMITH FALLS FOUL OF CMRS</h2><p>Top 20 firm Kingston Smith has been fined £5,000 and severely reprimanded by ICAEW over breaches of the Clients’ Money Regulations (CMRs).</p>\n<p>Under a consent order agreed with the institute’s investigation committee, the City-based firm admitted it had made withdrawals from the firm’s client money bank accounts on behalf of five clients. This was contrary to regulations 20(h) and 22 because it had failed to obtain written authority to make the payments or agreement to the fees.</p>\n<p>The firm had also failed to comply with regulation 13 of the CMRs as it held funds in excess of £10,000 for three clients for more than 30 days and did not pay them into client bank accounts designated by the clients’ name or a number or letters allocated to those accounts.</p>\n<h2>“UNWARRANTED SLUR&quot; WINS APPEAL</h2><p>An ICAEW member has won part of his appeal against severe disciplinary sanctions because he was not given the chance to defend himself at a tribunal hearing against what he described as an “unwarranted slur”.</p>\n<p>Tim Anderson had been charged with carrying out three audits for a client in breach of audit regulation 3.02. He had failed to arrange for external hot file reviews under Ethical Standard 4, which requires them when the audit fees of one client are likely to exceed 10% of the firm’s fee income.</p>\n<p>He had also provided incorrect information in the firm’s 2010 and 2011 practice assurance returns: he had stated that his firm had retained a record of the audit compliance review showing the work done and results, when in fact only informal reviews had been carried out and a record had not been kept.</p>\n<p>\nThe DCT found the charges proved on Anderson’s own admission. It treated the first as an example of “reckless or serious negligence” and the second as an “unjustifiable ethical failing”, and imposed on him a severe reprimand, <br /> a £3,450 fine and costs of £3,225.</p>\n<p>He appealed on the grounds that the specific charges were so trivial he could not properly be said to have brought discredit on himself, ICAEW or the profession; and the DCT had wrongly regarded as an aggravating factor the “dubious” coincidence that he had ceased conducting audits shortly before a Quality Assurance Department visit and in so doing had cast an unwarranted slur on him.</p>\n<p>The appeal committee panel said that the first ground was an argument that could not succeed as “every audit registered firm, whatever the size and value of its practice, is required to keep to professional rules and standards”. However, on the second ground, he did have a point. Nothing during the DCT hearing suggested that it would be taken into account as a factor, nor was the point put to Anderson. The panel reduced the sanctions to a reprimand, a £1,500 fine and £1,500 costs.</p>\n<div class=\"am_info_box\">\n\t<fieldset>\n\t<legend><div>REPORT LISTINGS</div></legend>\n\t<div class=\"text\"><p><b>These reports are summaries.
