Not likely. Penelope Rance asks six top chefs dedicated to using local, seasonal produce why it’s so important – and the ingredient they wait all year for","body":"<h2>ATUL KOCHHAR, BENARES, MAYFAIR</h2><p><i>“Nature gives its best to seasonal produce, and local is good because it has to travel less, without losing its essence. Local ingredients also mean we understand the context of where we are better. </i></p>\n<p>My menus are always planned around seasonal ingredients. I structure them with the ingredients that grow close to each other in soil or water and often around each other on the calendar as well. These flavours naturally work with each other.</p>\n<p>I work really hard with my restaurant managers and head chefs to know the best suppliers, farms and fishermen near that restaurant. It’s important to have those relationships so we can hear directly from the producer what we should be buying from one week to the next. Being responsive to nature and the seasons is one of the most exciting things about this job. </p>\n<p>I love asparagus and long for it to come into season again. I am in love with the produce in the UK and in awe of how much you have on this small island. You haven’t always realised what you have. For example, you still export most of your seafood, and it really is the best in the world.”</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://WWW.benaresrestaurant.com\" target=\"_self\">benaresrestaurant.com</a></p>\n<h2>LYNDY REDDING, ABSOLUTE TASTE, WANDSWORTH</h2><p><i>“At our restaurants and parties we really do champion local and seasonal ingredients. The chefs put forward ideas based on ingredients from their area. They say, ‘how about this guy down the lane, he does great bacon?’ So I have a look, and if it works, it goes on the menu.</i></p>\n<p>We really try to get a flavour of wherever we’re going to be. We do chef’s tours, looking at what everyone in an area has. When we opened The Terrace in Fenwick Tunbridge Wells last year, we toured Kent and went to different suppliers, including a cobnut farm. It was August, just before the harvest. We were standing there in the platt [cobnut orchard], among all the trees, and there was a windmill in the distance. It was wonderful. So cobnuts feature very highly on the menu, and we sell bags of them in the restaurant.</p>\n<p>For a chef who loves food, to go out and do local ingredient searches is the most rewarding thing. We hold events in Yorkshire, where I’m from, so I wanted to go back and see what was going on. We visited watercress, fruit and trout farms, and one with Dexter beef. The cows have two pints of Yorkshire ale every day – it keeps their meat soft and rich for wagyu beef. Then we went to the coast for lobster and crabs.</p>\n<p>I’m insistent with my guys that all our seafood is from the UK. We do a lot of mini fish and chips and it’s always pollock and hake. It’s sustainable but also delicious.</p>\n<p>The only problem we have with local and seasonal food is the quantity. We do the Salon Privé at Syon Park every year, and serve lobster – 3,500 people attend and have half a lobster each, so we’re prepping nearly 2,000. We have to go to a number of suppliers direct – we don’t go to wholesalers, as we want it all to be from the UK.</p>\n<p>Everyone wants to be local and seasonal, but it’s hard to do that. Asparagus has a very short season in the UK, but you see it on the menu all year. Everyone gets it from abroad. Which is why I’ve chosen broad beans as my ingredient. They’re not available fresh all year round, but when they’re in season they’re everywhere.</p>\n<p>When they’re not in season, you just don’t see them. They’re a very British thing, not grown overseas – I’m even growing them in pots in my own little London garden.”</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://WWW.absolutetaste.com\" target=\"_self\">absolutetaste.com</a> </p>\n<h2>MICHAEL WIGNALL, THE LATYMER, BAGSHOT</h2><p><i>“As chefs, it’s our responsibility to feed people things that are local. It used to be easy to plan menus, as you could just buy anything, all year round. And lots of people still do that – but it shows a bit more skill not to.</i></p>\n<p>It’s surprisingly hard to find suppliers who feel the same. Whether it’s a fishmonger or a farmer, they need to have the same passion as we do creating these dishes. A lot of people would rather supply the supermarkets, but nine times out of 10 the stuff in the supermarket is atrocious. </p>\n<p>For the past 15 years, we’ve worked closely with select growers and farmers, so we can say we want a certain type of radish, but we want it left in the ground three months longer to change the taste and texture, so it’s like a heritage radish.</p>\n<p>Last year we experimented with getting all our vegetables in from the suppliers still growing in trays – we picked small carrots and onions daily.</p>\n<p>But my ingredient of the season is honey. There’s a steady supply all year round, and the taste changes through the season, depending on the pollen the bees are collecting, which affects the dishes we choose to use it on. You can’t get more natural or local than your own hives, and  it’s the only thing we can take off the ground and use all the time. We have it at breakfast in the Brasserie, and we even use the hot beeswax to poach trout.”</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://WWW.pennyhillpark.co.uk\" target=\"_self\">pennyhillpark.co.uk</a></p>\n\n<div class=\"\"><div class=\"hide gallery\">\n<ul><li>d1f6ecc0bc28718da8647f21005e94dc</li><li>11c2af27e2f690d5ca53fd831196734c</li><li>34232316cf2919d973cc27420c0a4d45</li><li>9def38cb9c981e59c4ed2f41677cdffa</li><li>4cf5f8b186e77d5d496ae91c898093e3</li><li>03ea03b01ae22b917e8383406b7e291e</li></ul>\n</div></div><h2>CLAUDE BOSI, HIBISCUS, MAYFAIR</h2><p><i>“In my restaurant, we base the menu on the ingredients we have – it gives us more freedom. It’s important to respect the season. I’m a big believer that if produce grows together, somewhere along the line they will mix to make  a dish – for example rhubarb and strawberries are a very traditional combination.</i></p>\n<p>Our job is to respect the producer. I have been in England for 17 years and have a relationship with my suppliers – I don’t pass on an order any more. I call and ask what they have. They might have some fine bass, or halibut that day, so I take that.</p>\n<p>I use 100 different suppliers, and get the best from each. I also have 15 different butchers. I get guinea fowl from Scotland, chicken from Lancashire. I don’t worry about quantity – when it’s finished, it’s finished. That is the freedom.</p>\n<p>If they say they only have six Dover sole today, that is the way it should be. I take it, we do six, then move on. If people can’t understand that, they shouldn’t go to a restaurant – they should go to a fast-food shop.</p>\n<p>People cannot expect to have standard dishes  on the menu. With autumn, the black truffle is coming. People call to ask for it and are excited when it’s back on. You could have shaved truffle all year round, or use truffle oil, but it would be cheap, not in season. What’s the point?</p>\n<p>We will go further afield for better quality. We get ingredients where the producers are best, not because they are inside the M25. We don’t change just to use local producers. I’m in London – where do you want me to get my vegetables? You have to have some transport, you just minimise it as much as you can.</p>\n<p>There’s so much produce. Every season I wait for the peas. There’s a pudding I make with them, that I have done for the past five years. For a main course I do a fricassee with ginger and grapefruit for vegetarians, or peas and chorizo.</p>\n<p>I love peas – they’re so small, but if they’re good quality and fresh, they have so much flavour. They are tender, and sweet. It’s a short season when they are at their best. I’m very lucky to be able to do this job and work with produce like this. I want to take care of it, and do my best with it.”</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://WWW.hibiscusrestaurant.co.uk\" target=\"_self\">hibiscusrestaurant.co.uk</a> </p>\n<h2>TOMMY BOLAND, ALMEIDA, ISLINGTON</h2><p><i>“I’ve worked in enough top restaurants to know that only a select few chefs actually plan their menus around the seasons, even though many say they do it. But using seasonal ingredients makes sense. It keeps you excited and it ensures that everything is at its cheapest and best quality. You can buy Kenyan green beans and chestnuts all year long, but they’re super expensive and half the time they taste nothing like they’re supposed to. </i></p>\n<p>A lot of people are scared of change but when things have been the same for a while, I like to mix it up. At the moment, I change the menu every couple of days. It keeps the boys on their toes.</p>\n<p>I started working for Éric Chavot when I was  17 and when he was at the Capital Hotel in Knightsbridge. He is very strict on the seasons; his philosophy is to produce the best you can. It took a while for it to sink in, but that’s where it all stemmed from.</p>\n<p>We never have a problem getting the right quantity or quality as I use the same suppliers I’ve been using for years. Our beef is from Surrey, our fish is from Cornwall or Scotland, and our shellfish is all from Scotland. Veg tends to vary – in season here you get a lot of wild strawberries, but most of the fruit comes from Spain. A lot of the veg is from the South of France or Italy, as they can produce it better than we can.</p>\n<p>I tend not to follow food trends. I like to keep things simple, and make the food I love to eat. I especially love borlotti beans. They give some body and produce a stock for the rest of the dish. Better still, you can buy them completely fresh and they take very little time to cook, whereas dry beans need to be soaked overnight and cooked for three hours – and then they explode.</p>\n<p>Borlotti beans come into season in late spring and continue all the way through to July. I especially like using them with mousserons – tiny mushrooms from France. The combination of the slippery mushrooms and chalky beans is amazing, especially with lamb. It’s also a nice change from the usual carbohydrates like pasta or rice. And because the beans have such a mild flavour, they absorb whatever flavours you cook them with.   But borlotti beans don’t grow in the UK. My supplier at Covent Garden Market imports them from southern Italy.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, though, I just want to produce good food, get a busy restaurant, and be happy. What comes will come and there is no point in chasing Michelin stars, for example, because you’ll just go mad. And I’m already pretty crazy.”</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://WWW.almeida-restaurant.co.uk\" target=\"_self\">almeida-restaurant.co.uk</a></p>\n<h2>ROB BRAGAGNOLO, MARBEN, TORONTO</h2><p><i>“What’s important to me as a cook is the quality of an ingredient – I look for one that is at its peak. And that is almost always an ingredient that is in season and has been grown locally.   Our menu is in a constant state of change to adapt to the seasons and life cycle of the ingredients we source. For example, spot prawns have a very short, six-week season, so during that time we  will put a lot of focus on that ingredient.</i></p>\n<p>Fiddleheads, ramps and asparagus are other short-lived seasonal ingredients that we try to showcase during spring – they make their way onto multiple dishes on our menu.</p>\n<p>We use a wide variety of sources for our ingredients. Fortunately there are a lot of very dedicated, hardworking suppliers that will forage or cultivate locally-grown, seasonal products for us. We have a wild mushroom forager, a wild herb forager, a local spring-fed trout farmer, a goat farmer… It’s a long list of wonderful partners.</p>\n<p>I absolutely love fiddleheads, which are the furled fronds of a young fern. They have a delicate taste similar to asparagus. And above all, they represent spring to many cooks in Canada, and mark the end of our long, dreary winters.”</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://WWW.marbenrestaurant.com\"

excellent Edinburgh-based Contini Ristorante, Victor and Carina Contini were always keen to celebrate the Scottish side of their heritage – and the famed Scottish larder. Five years ago, they took on the National Gallery site, sourcing ingredients from more than 60 artisan Scottish producers, and two years ago, they renovated a one-acre garden in the nearby Esk Valley to grow their own fruit and vegetables. The result is the sort of national monument café that every city should aspire to: local, seasonal, sustainable and delicious. At breakfast, the Aberdeen buttery – a Scottish speciality somewhere between crusty breakfast roll and croissant – is a thing of beauty, particularly with Clava Brie, Isle of Mull cheddar, their own ham and homemade chutney. Dining offers a glorious view of Princes Street Gardens – where the Contini’s have their herb patch.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://WWW.contini.com\" target=\"_self\">contini.com</a></p>\n<h2>LUNCH</h2><h2><b>Grain Store, King’s Cross, London</b></h2><p>Bruno Loubet’s Grain Store is just damned good. The National Restaurant Awards judges declared it the UK’s Most Sustainable Restaurant last year. Cynics might point out that meat comes all the way from Denham Estate in Suffolk and Lake District Farmers in Cumbria. But the response to that is simple: Grain Store is “quasi-vegetarian”. Meat features only as a garnish in a handful of dishes.    It’s seasonal veg that gets the starring role in this nicely-lit, open room, be it white asparagus crusted with sesame seeds, silken tofu and wild garlic, or braised endives filled with quinoa, wood roast onions and Toulouse sausage ragout. Grain Store is proof that healthy and worthy can also be fun and tasty.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://WWW.summerlodgehotel.co.uk\" target=\"_self\">grainstore.com</a></p>\n<h2>DINNER</h2><h2><b>Summer Lodge Hotel, Evershot, Dorset</b></h2><p>On the US east coast, particularly in Maine, local and seasonal is not a trend; it’s just the freshest, tastiest, most logical thing. A fine exponent of that philosophy is Maine’s White Barn Inn. And one of its former chefs, Steven Titman, is now running a kitchen in Dorset using local meat, fish and produce – often from Summer Lodge’s own garden. Look out for the cress addition to a superlative warm salad of Lyme Bay mackerel   with beetroot. Local woodland-reared chicken spoke of a bird that had a decent run among the trees, a risotto of fine herbs with English asparagus and poached free-range egg ticked all the right boxes, and of the 27 cheeses on the menu, 26 are from the south-west.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://WWW.summerlodgehotel.co.uk\" target=\"_self\">summerlodgehotel.co.uk</a></p>\n<div class=\"am_info_box\">\n\t<fieldset>\n\t<legend><div>Menu</div></legend>\n\t<div class=\"text\"><h2>BREAKFAST</h2><p>Aberdeen buttery with brie, cheddar, ham and chutney<b> £8.50</b></p>\n<p>Caffe latte (ethically sourced coffee from Brazil) <b>£2.95</b></p>\n<p>Cuddybridge apple juice <b>£4</b></p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>LUNCH</h2><p>White asparagus crusted with sesame seeds,  silken tofu and wild garlic <b>£8.50</b></p>\n<p>Braised endives filled with quinoa, wood roast onions and Toulouse sausage ragout <b>£16</b></p>\n<p>Toasted oat and buttermilk panna cotta, caramel  poached pear, hazelnut brittle<b> £6</b></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>DINNER</h2><p>Three-course set dinner <b>£47</b> (£9 supplement for additional cheese course)</p>\n</div>\n\t</fieldset>\n</div>","layout":{"landscape":{"id":"am-dp1-layout29","link":"story-landscape-layout15.html"},"portrait":{"id":"am-dp1-layout30","link":"story-portrait-layout15.html"}},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":"","link_source":"","image":[{"id":"4ddb8db9494dd0754714da2e324b0c04","name":"restaurant2","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com/var/economia/storage/images/restaurant2/56435-1-eng-GB/restaurant2_story_img_size_708x339.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"709","height":"339","is_default":true},{"id":"4ddb8db9494dd0754714da2e324b0c04","name":"restaurant2","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com/var/economia/storage/images/restaurant2/56435-1-eng-GB/restaurant2_story_img_size_964x413.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"965","height":"413","is_default":false}],"url_alias":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com","type":"story","order":"35","folio_number":"0","folio_numbers":"","pdf_page_index":"0","thumbnail":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com/var/economia/storage/images/restaurant2/56435-1-eng-GB/restaurant2_tablet_story_thumbnail.jpg","color":"f8714c","real_id":"6105","main_section_id":"663","ads":[]},{"id":"fc2be835689eba262d7f70517ab030ac","title":"Six of the best","sub_title":"","author":[{"id":"0","name":"Emily Black","email":"emily.black@progressivecp.com","is_default":false}],"tag":"","strap_line":"Six of the best: small vineyards","short_intro":"","intro":"With the rise of the artisan vineyard, there’s an almost endless array of small producers offering top-class wine.

Penelope Rance suggests how to get your greens without having to chew the cud","body":"<p class=\"dropcap\">Eat enough kale, and you could live to be 140 – or    so the findings of a recent University College London study would have us believe.</p>\n<p>Whether you’re following the path to inner peas, or would rather drown in chip fat than pout for a sprout, the reality is we could all benefit from eating more unprocessed vegetables.</p>\n<p>And we are talking vegetables here: fruit may be part of the seven-a-day advice, but the real health benefits lie in the green (and orange and red and purple and white) stuff without all the sugar.</p>\n<p>Mainlining grapes and apple juice will have the same affect on your body as chewing sugar cubes – spiking insulin levels, promoting fat storage and fast-tracking you to a range of severe health problems.</p>\n<p>Veg, meanwhile, will not. But at 80g per portion, there is a limit to how much virtuous roughage we can fit on a plate. With that in mind, here are some ideas of how to get more servings in without really noticing.</p>\n<h2>CAULIFLOWER</h2><p><b>Daily serving: 8 florets</b></p>\n<p class=\"noindent\">Cauliflower may look like a brain and smell a bit funky, but it’s incredibly versatile. It contains oestrogen-reducing plant sterols and is a great source of vitamin C. Steam it and mash with butter and you’ve got a shepherds  pie topping or the perfect companion to a helping of sausages. Grate it or pulse briefly in a food processor and it will form rice-sized grains, ideal for fried rice, with curry or even in risotto – and it cooks a lot quicker. Tossed in olive oil, salt and pepper and baked in the oven, cauliflower florets are a crispy, crunchy addition to the Sunday roast.</p>\n<h2>COURGETTE</h2><p><b>Daily serving: ½ a large one</b></p>\n<p class=\"noindent\">Who needs spaghetti when you have courgettes? Julienned with a peeler then sliced into strips, or even put through a specialised ‘spiraliser’, they’re delicious stir-fried with a  little garlic and olive oil, or pesto.  Just top with your favourite protein or pasta sauce and you’re set. Top tip: press the noodles between kitchen paper to remove excess moisture. The moisture is brilliant, however, for baking. Mix grated courgette into banana bread or brownies and it will add potassium, good for reducing blood pressure,    as well as great texture.</p>\n<h2>SPINACH</h2><p><b>Daily serving: 1 small bowl, fresh</b></p>\n<p class=\"noindent\">Throw a serving of spinach in with your scrambled eggs, layer it under salmon, stir it into stews, substitute it for lettuce in salad – this is a green that goes with any meal. Spinach is a powerhouse of disease-preventing phytonutrients and soluble dietary fibre. Even better, it wilts down to nothing in seconds, so you can get in a lot of leaves in a few mouthfuls. Cooked up with leeks, savoy cabbage, nutmeg and orange zest, it’s divine.</p>\n<h2>CARROT</h2><p><b>Daily serving: 3 heaped tbsp grated</b></p>\n<p class=\"noindent\">I have it on good authority that grated carrot fried in butter is a fine breakfast food, but if that’s a step too far for you to take, they also make a nutritious and virtuous alternative to chips. Cut into thin batons, drizzle with olive oil and roast in the oven with some similarly sliced sweet potato and they are delicious. Low in calories while high in vitamin A and the antioxidant beta-carotene, carrots may help fight cancer too. They also make a good addition to pasta sauce. And if you grate them, they melt into a bolognaise sauce – as well as adding nutrients they’ll stretch your mince meat further. </p>\n<h2>AVOCADO</h2><p><b>Daily serving: ½ a pear</b></p>\n<p class=\"noindent\">Yes, it’s technically a fruit, but with all that omega-6 monounsaturated fat, anti-inflammatory tannin and very little sugar, it’s a special one. The creamy texture offers a wealth of uses. Go for a traditional guacamole (with minced red onions and lime juice for added points) which can be piled on bacon for breakfast, salad for lunch or just about any meat or fish at dinner. Whizzed up with coconut water, lemon and lime juice and mint, it creates a zingy breakfast smoothie. And, my personal favourite, blend it with cocoa powder and a touch of honey for a decadent, guilt-free chocolate mousse.</p>\n","layout":{"landscape":{"id":"am-dp1-layout29","link":"story-landscape-layout15.html"},"portrait":{"id":"am-dp1-layout30","link":"story-portrait-layout15.html"}},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":"","link_source":"","image":[{"id":"c09f38af2b5df2b1abe413744c8f84fc","name":"health","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com/var/economia/storage/images/health3/56260-1-eng-GB/health_story_img_size_708x339.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"709","height":"339","is_default":true},{"id":"c09f38af2b5df2b1abe413744c8f84fc","name":"health","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com/var/economia/storage/images/health3/56260-1-eng-GB/health_story_img_size_964x413.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"965","height":"413","is_default":false}],"url_alias":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com","type":"story","order":"37","folio_number":"0","folio_numbers":"","pdf_page_index":"0","thumbnail":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com/var/economia/storage/images/health3/56260-1-eng-GB/health_tablet_story_thumbnail.jpg","color":"f8714c","real_id":"6109","main_section_id":"663","ads":[]},{"id":"198a605933e34d15b2a33fbc28a45b12","title":"Rolling with it","sub_title":"","author":[{"id":"0","name":"Emily Black","email":"emily.black@progressivecp.com","is_default":false}],"tag":"","strap_line":"Life after work","short_intro":"","intro":"Bruce Lawson has never passed up the opportunity to do something a bit different.  He tells Peter Taylor-Whiffen about his unconventional career","body":"<p class=\"dropcap\">Bruce Lawson’s life has certainly never been dull. “I suppose you’d call me a maverick,” he says. “Not an eccentric, but I’m not really a team player – more someone who takes their own chances. I like that.”</p>\n<p>This, after all, is a man who has launched a major radio station, played rugby for Jamaica, walked through the Channel Tunnel, been national treasurer of Ukip and has just written his first book – and all this after becoming an accountant at 16, because his dad promised him a Lambretta if he did.</p>\n<p>“He said if I went into accountancy he’d get me a scooter,” says Lawson. “It was great, it cost £50 and lasted an hour-and-a-half before I crashed it into a tree, so I went to work on the bus.”</p>\n<p>There is at least some convention to his career. He began at his uncle’s firm before joining McLintocks, (now KPMG). Then he enjoyed four years in the Caribbean working for Price Waterhouse (now PwC) and, incongruously, playing in four international rugby fixtures. He later joined Coopers &amp; Lybrand in Cork before buying half a practice in Kidderminster. He remained self-employed for the next 37 years, ending with a spell as consultant to Shropshire farming specialists Hudson LM.</p>\n<p>But Lawson’s extra-curricular activities have given him as much satisfaction. “Some accountants stay at the same office forever. That’s great, but it’s not me. I like to look for opportunities.” Hence his fundraising of £500,000 to launch Radio Wyvern in 1982, and his oversight of Ukip’s finances. “After Nigel Farage took over as leader I became treasurer. I could have been an MEP but I don’t care for all the political machinations, whichever party it is. Every political career ends in tears eventually.”</p>\n<p>But Lawson quickly found a replacement career – as a writer. “In 2009 I read Andrew Marr’s The Making of Modern Britain, which featured a section on Charles Rolls – one half of Rolls-Royce. I thought he was fascinating and found out more, and it seemed logical to write it all down, in a ripping good yarn.”</p>\n<p>The result is the biography, Charles Rolls of Rolls-Royce. “Rolls was the Richard Branson of the Edwardian age,” says Lawson. “He was a brilliant man, full of ideas. He was an adventurer – he won the second ever TT race on the Isle of Man, made 177 balloon flights and he was the first Briton to die flying his own plane. But he was also strange and parsimonious – he’d arrive at a hotel with nothing but a pair of clean socks in his top pocket. I did not have the first clue about cars, but Rolls intrigued me.”</p>\n<p>Passion for the man resulted in Lawson acquiring one of  Rolls’ creations – eventually – that he now drives on the roads surrounding his home town of Montgomery, Powys. “I started going to Rolls-Royce Enthusiasts’ Club events, but realised I couldn’t turn up in my Vauxhall estate. So I now drive an Ocean Blue 1986 Rolls Royce – christened Lady J.</p>\n<p>“Primarily all of this is possible because of my accounting career. I could have ended up a journalist, or an alcoholic, or both, but I became an accountant. Some people think accountancy is about numbers. It isn’t, it’s about people – and I’ve had a lot of fun.”</p>\n","layout":{"landscape":{"id":"am-dp1-layout29","link":"story-landscape-layout15.html"},"portrait":{"id":"am-dp1-layout30","link":"story-portrait-layout15.html"}},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":"","link_source":"","image":[{"id":"b55334876e1ff935d32fdd8a40916759","name":"life after work","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com/var/economia/storage/images/life-after-work7/56428-1-eng-GB/life-after-work_story_img_size_708x339.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"708","height":"339","is_default":true},{"id":"b55334876e1ff935d32fdd8a40916759","name":"life after work","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com/var/economia/storage/images/life-after-work7/56428-1-eng-GB/life-after-work_story_img_size_964x413.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"964","height":"413","is_default":false}],"url_alias":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com","type":"story","order":"38","folio_number":"0","folio_numbers":"","pdf_page_index":"0","thumbnail":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com/var/economia/storage/images/life-after-work7/56428-1-eng-GB/life-after-work_tablet_story_thumbnail.jpg","color":"f8714c","real_id":"6111","main_section_id":"663","ads":[]}],"type":null,"ads":[]}}
