<h2>UK FORECAST: SUNNY SPELLS</h2><p>The recession clouds are finally lifting and UK’s economic forecast is enjoying a sunny spell, with GDP reaching pre-recession levels and confidence in the UK financial system hitting a post-crisis high.</p>
<p>The economy grew 0.9% in the three months to May, pushing above the previous peak post-recession level set in January 2008, according to estimates by the National Institute of Economic and Social Research. Separately, it is predicted that GDP could increase by as much as 5% in September when R&amp;D costs and black market activities are factored into the methodology.</p>
<p>The Bank of England’s biannual Systematic Risk survey also showed that confidence in the City was healthy. In its survey of 72 asset managers, hedge funds, insurers and executives responsible for risk management, 64% said that the probability of a “high impact” event hitting the financial system over the short- and medium-term was low or very low. The number of people in employment also increased by a record 345,000 in the three months to April, bringing the UK unemployment rate down to 6.6%.</p>
<p>But Oliver Burrows, credit analyst at Rabobank, counselled caution. “In some ways it feels like 2010: we have a crisis behind us, optimism is at a high and markets have short memories,” he said. “The risks have seemingly been put to bed – bank capital and liquidity, the euro crisis. But there is always risk hiding around the corner – the idea that there are no clouds on the horizon seems a little odd.”</p>
<h2>BIG FOUR FEES BOOM</h2><p>The Big Four firms earned 10 times more in audit fees than the next six biggest accountancy practices combined, Financial Reporting Council statistics have shown.</p>
<p>The Big Four earned 71% of the total fee income of audit firms in 2013 with an average income of £2.06bn, compared to the £202m earned by the next six firms combined. The next 20 firms earned just £23.148m last year in audit fees combined.</p>
<p>However, the largest non-Big Four firms – Grant Thornton, BDO, Baker Tilly, and Mazars – enjoyed their best results in five years and saw their total fee income grow 2.6% last year, up from 0.6% growth in 2012. Meanwhile the Big Four saw their fee income rise by 3.9% in 2013, but the growth rate was significantly lower than previous years – it grew by 7.7% in 2012 and 5.7% in 2011.</p>
<h2>MINIMUM WAGE TO BE ENFORCED BY FINES</h2><p>Under new rules that came into effect in October 2013 to name and shame employers that break the national minimum wage law, the government has now announced that employers who fail to pay workers the minimum wage will be fined as much as £20,000 per employee.</p>
<p>After the Queen’s Speech last month, a list of 25 offending employers was released by HMRC, which between them owe more than £43,000 to workers. They include a school in Edinburgh that underpaid an employee by £3,739, a garage in Bradford that underpaid a worker by £6,426 and a central heating company in Hampshire that failed to pay £6,200 to four workers. Business minister Jenny Willott said: “If employers break the law they need to know they will face tough consequences.” The adult minimum wage, which currently stands at £6.31, will rise to £6.50 in October.</p>
<h2>CYBERCRIME CRACKDOWN</h2><p>The Bank of England has announced rigorous testing of electronic defences to the UK’s biggest financial institutions. The new cyber security system, known as CBEST, will be used by private security firms and licensed computer hacking companies to spot weaknesses, but results are unlikely to be made public. Andrew Gracie, executive director of resolution at the BoE, said: “The results should provide a direct readout on a firm’s capability to withstand cyber attacks.”</p>
<h2>THE INTERNATIONAL PICTURE</h2><p><b>THE AMOUNT OF PRIVATE WEALTH</b> held by households  around the world surged 14.6% to $152trn (£91trn) last year, thanks in part to rising stock markets, according to a report by management consulting firm, Boston Consulting Group. The fastest-growing region was Asia Pacific, which saw a 30.5% increase to $37trn (£21.7trn), largely a result  of strong nominal GDP growth in China and India.</p>
<p>North America and western Europe remained the wealthiest regions in the world with private wealth of $50.3trn (£29.5trn) and $37.9trn (£22.2trn) respectively. However, Asia Pacific is projected to overtake them by 2018, with private wealth estimated to reach $61trn.</p>
<p><b>ELSEWHERE IN THE WORLD</b>  Brazil’s economy continues to struggle despite the World Cup effect. Business investment fell 2.1% in the first three months of 2014, the biggest decline in two years, and the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics revised economic growth down to 0.4% in the last three months of 2013. Brazil’s economy has averaged just 2% growth each year since President Dilma Rousseff took office in 2011. Asked why the economy isn’t growing faster, Rousseff said last month: “You can’t explain why. All conditions point to Brazil not only growing, but growing well.”</p>
