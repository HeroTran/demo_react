<h2 class="noindent">IT'S WRONG TO LET HMRC GET ITS HANDS ON OUR BANK ACCOUNTS</h2><p class="noindent">As a retired chartered accountant I am appalled at the erosion of civil liberties our profession is allowing to happen at the hands of HMRC. I refer in particular to RTI, and HMRC’s intention “to reach into people’s bank accounts and yoink money it thinks it is owed” (editorial comment, June 2014).</p>
<p>RTI is the action of a police state seeking to control taxpayers’ income. Is the rise of self-employment, reported in the press, an unintended consequence of RTI? Will the next step be for industry to send over its monthly/weekly payroll to HMRC to decide how much is paid to employees? What will happen with powers of RTI in the hands of a left-wing socialist government?</p>
<p>I appreciate that RTI is limited to curbing welfare payments, but could it be that taxing income is causing poverty and thus the need for welfare. As the need for welfare increases, so taxes have to increase to attempt to meet the costs.</p>
<p>I’d like to make one further point about the development of the police state. In my 2013/2014 self assessment return there is no space to claim married couples allowance (MCA). It is only because I am aware that I am entitled to MCA that I scoured ‘Brief notes: Tax Return’. On page 7 it states: “Please use the Additional Information pages for MCA”, which were not sent. Is this dishonest practice by HMRC, ie, making it difficult to claim MCA?</p>
<p>Surely the profession has to wake up to fulfil our public duty of protecting the public interest?</p>

<h2 class="noindent">IASB AND FASB CONVERGE ON REVENUE RECOGNITION</h2><p class="noindent">In the FRC’s paper published on 4 June entitled True and Fair, the document stresses the overriding requirement for financial statements to show a true and fair view, even those prepared under IFRS. Where the FRC continues to be mistaken is to claim that IFRS-based financial statements necessarily give a true and fair view because “no IFRS can be endorsed by the EU if compliance  with it is inconsistent with a true and  fair view”.</p>
<p>It was for that reason that the EU failed to endorse the fair-value accounting aspects of international standards except at group level. The EU could see that compliance at entity level was inconsistent with a true and fair view in some areas. The UK profession should have stood up for truth and fairness as well, instead of being willing to permit globalisation at any price regardless of the impact on the financial system.</p>
<p class="noindent"><b>Ian Sunderland</b></p>
<p>If ICAEW is right in claiming a fair presentation is the same as a true and fair view, why didn’t it argue for a true and fair view for revenue regardless of what the varying standards required? A true and fair view should be all-pervasive even where defective guidance such as UITF 40 (and IAS 39) was in place.</p>

<h2 class="noindent">WOULD LEAVING THE EU HARM UK EXPORTS?</h2><p class="noindent">When Andy Bagnall argues that, “Being inside a reformed EU is vital to future jobs, exports and growth,” (Debate, June 2014) he undermines it already. The EU is not reformed and there are entrenched interests against the idea. Can he support continued membership of the EU as it continues to be evermore intrusive, expensive and corrupt?</p>

<h2 class="noindent">UKIP MEP IN LAND ROW</h2><p class="noindent">Was this report planted by William Dartmouth? I wonder only because it shows him to be a man with very sensible views on trade and windmills and roughly well-qualified to represent the good citizens of the South West. Usually economia only mentions his party in order to criticise. Please can we have more like him in parliament and also in the ICAEW.</p>
<p class="noindent"><b>Epping Blogger</b></p>
<p>I once attended a UKIP public meeting, out of curiosity, and heard Lord Dartmouth deliver what I personally considered to be an incoherent rant.</p>
<p>I find it difficult to believe that the same person could have had an Eton and Oxford education and passed ICAEW exams. Which, I suppose, just goes to show how we all change over time.</p>
<p>I’m afraid I cannot agree that we need more like him in either the Westminster or EU parliaments, or for that matter in the ICAEW.</p>

<h2 class="noindent">HMRC SERVICE STANDARDS CONTINUE TO DISAPPOINT</h2><p class="noindent">Staffing levels at the customer service centres must be extremely low as I called the employers’ helpline and was waiting in a queue for 22 minutes to speak to someone. Compare this with the immediate response time when you call the collector of taxes – it can only show you where HMRC are allocating  their resources.</p>

<h2 class="noindent">FRC PUBLISHED BIG FOUR AUDIT REPORTS</h2><p>More in-depth, forensic auditing techniques would have exposed the recent disastrous banking policies, for example, much earlier in the cycle. But, this would have meant higher audit costs to clients. In recent years, audits have been dumbed down and skim across the top – to compete on fees, I suggest.</p>
<p>Do we place too much reliance on letters of representation? It’s time we accountants stood up for the importance of audit work to our clients.</p>
<p>Michel Barnier, the European Commission’s internal markets commissioner (below), is quoted as saying auditors were “the dog that didn’t bark”.</p>
<p class="noindent"><b>David Thornton</b></p>
<p class="noindent">“The state of Bank audits continues to disappoint.” Banks had a major input  into the 2008 credit crash. Banks continue to award significant compensation packages, regardless of performance. Banks are helping to finance another imminent financial catastrophe. Moral hazard ruled the day.</p>
<p>When is somebody, with clout, going to put banks in their place? Don’t bother splitting banks up into good and bad banks. Let them fail and, guess what, new financiers will spring up.</p>
<p class="noindent"><b>Brian Thomas</b></p>
<p>It is simply fantastic that any number of public regulators, and indeed also the ICAEW, have totally failed to castigate, penalise and criminalise in public the individual partners of the Big Four that signed off the accounts.</p>
