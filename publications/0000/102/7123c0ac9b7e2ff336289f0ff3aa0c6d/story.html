<p class="dropcap">One recent morning, on a visit to Israel, we drove north from Jerusalem travelling alongside the Sea of Galilee and then on to the occupied Golan Heights, which Israel captured from Syria in the 1967 war. Leaving the car, I made my way uphill to where a small group of Fijian soldiers, part of a UN peacekeeping mission, peered through telescopes into the Syrian villages below.</p>
<p>Of the two nearest villages, I was told that one was held by Syrian government forces; the other was under rebel control. You could hear artillery fire and explosions. The war felt very close indeed.</p>
<p>A few weeks after my visit, an Israeli youth was killed in the Golan Heights after a truck in which he was travelling with his father was hit by a missile fired from inside Syria, the first such death since the start of the Syrian war in 2011. The Israelis responded with the inevitable air strikes on “strategic targets”. </p>
<p>Since the 1973 Yom Kippur War, the Syrian border has been Israel’s quietest. That’s no longer so. The Syrian civil war has been raging now for three years and has created the conditions in which atrocity-minded jihadists and rebel militias have flourished.</p>
<h2 class="noindent">ALL OUT SUNNI-SHIA WAR</h2><p class="noindent">The swift and devastating advance into Iraq by the Sunni-militant group Isis (the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham) seemed to take the West by surprise. It shouldn’t have. The porous border between Iraq and Syria has allowed militants to move freely. A blood-dimmed tide is washing over the Middle East and what we are witnessing is nothing less than an all-out Sunni-Shia war.</p>
<p>Isis are battle-hardened, fanatical and utterly ruthless. Fighting for and alongside them are young British men, disaffected Sunni Muslims who have been radicalised in mosques in England, Scotland and Wales and who have gone to Syria in search of adventure and self-validation. They see themselves as holy warriors, fighters for Islam. And they are of serious concern to the British security forces.</p>
<p>What the British government fears more than anything else at present is blowback. “Foreign policy,” David Miliband once said to me when he was Foreign Secretary, “is inseparable from domestic policy now. Is terrorism foreign policy  or domestic policy? It’s both. It’s the same with crime, with the economy, climate change.”</p>
<p>It is estimated that as many as 150,000 people have been killed since the start of the Syrian war, notwithstanding all those who have been maimed and injured and the millions who have fled the country seeking refuge in camps in Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan and even Bulgaria. In truth, the number of dead could be much higher: a senior commander in the Israel Defence Force told me that more than 300,000 had been killed. </p>
<h2 class="noindent">PETTY AND ATTRITIONAL</h2><p class="noindent">Domestic politics in Britain can at times seem petty and attritional. Our politicians quarrel about anything from immigration (even though they can do nothing to control the free movement of labour in the EU) to the “cost of living crisis” and the slump in real wages.</p>
<p>What is missing is a largeness of vision, from all three main parties, a sense of what kind of country Britain should be in a truly globalised age. Should it be open to the world, internationalist, free-trading, welcoming to economic migrants? Or should it retreat behind a shield of immigration quotas, euroscepticism and protectionism?</p>
<p>Clearly not enough has been done by the great powers to end the slaughter in Syria. The UN Security Council is divided along old cold war lines and this weakness has merely emboldened the Assad regime in Syria and encouraged it to dig in.</p>
<p>There is no indication that the war in Syria will end any time soon and, as I write, the Isis advance towards Baghdad has been halted but the survival of the state of Iraq itself, created after the First World War, has never seemed more precarious.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, videos of young British jihadists in Syria and Iraq are being uploaded to the internet, creating fear. What alarms the Westminster elite is what might happen when some of these men come home. As David Miliband said: “Foreign and domestic policy are now inseparable.”</p>
