<p class="dropcap">My mother wanted me to become a doctor but the sight of blood made me queasy so, partway through my medical degree, I transferred to an economics degree at Delhi University and never looked back. It was there, during an internship at the Indian affiliate of Ernst &amp; Whinney (now EY) that I met a wonderful partner and mentor who gave me hope that I could move to the UK to train as a chartered accountant. That’s exactly what I did.</p>
<p>Ten days before I left India, I didn’t have a passport. My father borrowed money for my flight and off I went, determined not to return until I succeeded. Failure was not an option, so I worked all week, studied for my ACA on weekends and squeezed in a cleaning job to support myself.</p>
<p>My goal from day one was to join a Big Eight firm, as my mentor in Delhi had qualified with one. In particular, I was keen to train with Arthur Andersen, the gold standard in the profession at the time. However, I was a non-UK graduate so Andersen and the other Big Eight firms (today, the Big Four) wouldn’t even interview me, let alone employ me. Instead I joined regional firm Haines Watts.</p>
<p>By my third year I was consulting and assisting the office managing partner. I also earned the highest marks in the county for two ACA papers so, when I qualified, I was convinced I was on par with the Oxbridge candidates Andersen employed. I applied again, but again they wouldn’t accept me.</p>
<p>Only when I had done stints with Grant Thornton in Germany and London did Andersen finally employ me. The feeling was incredible. Finally, I had been accepted. The experience of working for a Big Eight firm was wonderful; in particular the quality of the resources, clients, fellow professionals and leaders.</p>
<p>Though I progressed quickly and steadily, I often felt different to my peers. I spoke English perfectly but with a very different accent (I still have an amalgamation of accents.) At times people picked on things I said, and even laughed at me. I also felt I had to work three times harder than everyone else because I am an outsider, a woman and a non-native English speaker. I still feel that today.</p>
<p>But I have tremendous drive. That’s why I jumped at the chance when a managing partner in Andersen’s New York practice invited me to join a new division that would later become known as forensic accounting. Forensic accounting barely existed in the 1990s. We started as a team of five and, by the time Andersen collapsed, we were a team of nearly 30.</p>
<p>From there, I moved to EY’s forensic and investigations department where I stayed for eight more fascinating years. In this post-Enron world, forensic accounting went to a whole new level. As businesses became more sophisticated with the advent of technology and globalisation, so too did business fraud, adding extra layers of complexity.</p>
<p>Yet moving to EY took some adjusting. Culturally, the firms were very different: Andersen was extremely entrepreneurial and fast paced and, even in those early days, it had specialists in computer fraud. EY didn’t at the time. It was far more conflict averse and made decisions thoughtfully and carefully.</p>
<p>However, I am attracted to the new and unknown. That’s why I flew to the UK determined to make it into the Big Eight. That’s also why I specialised in forensic accounting when it was an unknown field. And that’s why, three years ago, I left forensic accounting behind to become principal of EY’s Centre for Board Matters. My motto is: ‘when you start getting comfortable, get uncomfortable’. That’s the only way to keep pushing yourself and achieve what you’re truly capable of.</p>
