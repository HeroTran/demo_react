<p class="dropcap">When David Bernstein was appointed Football Association chairman in 2011, he was portrayed in the press as a “safe pair of hands” and a steady influence. This was exactly what the beleaguered body needed to steer it through the rocky waters stirred up by the failure of England’s 2018 World Cup bid and the abrupt resignation of his predecessor. And as I walk into Bernstein’s home, where I am warmly greeted while his grandchildren’s toys are tidied away for the ensuing photo shoot, this is exactly how he seems in person too.</p>
<p>Yet beneath his friendly manner and obvious comfort with journalists is a pioneering individual who is unafraid of making bold decisions. He spoke as the lone dissenting voice at world football governing body FIFA against the re-election of president Sepp Blatter; pushed the notoriously traditionalist FA to appoint its first female director; and delivered the news to a club legend and his boyhood hero that his time was up.</p>
<p>This mix of diplomacy and independence laid the foundations for a career that saw him advance from trainee accountant at Robson Rhodes to some of the most prominent executive roles in the UK. “I quite like it in the trenches,” he confides over coffee. “When you really need to rally people together and there’s need for radical change, I actually enjoy pressure. As long as you believe you’re doing the right thing and — I use this phrase quite carefully — coming from a strong moral base.”</p>
<p>This principled approach led to the incident for which his tenure at the FA is most remembered — handling the accusation that then-England captain John Terry racially abused a fellow player on the pitch. Bernstein was instrumental in stripping Terry of the skipper’s armband before a full investigation had been completed. It ultimately led to manager Fabio Capello resigning. “We did the right thing,” he says with confidence.</p>
<p>Born in St Helens in 1943, Bernstein moved to London and qualified with Robson Rhodes as a chartered accountant in 1966. His career choice was made by process of elimination. “I always had a fancy for business and numbers and wanted to get a professional qualification. I wasn’t suited to the medical-type professions and the law never appealed. I liked the feel of finance, although you’re never quite sure what you’re in for. I went straight into articles, as they were then, after my A-levels.”</p>
<p>Following a year at Hacker Young, he moved on to Bright Grahame Murray, making partner at 25. He spent the next 20 years there before joining brand management business Pentland Group as joint chief executive. Funded by money from the sale of Reebok, Pentland went from strength to strength, acquiring established brands including Speedo and Berghaus, and getting “very close” to buying Adidas. Although it was a “fabulous time”, towards the end he wanted more control of his diary. He took on a series of chairman and non-executive positions in the retail industry at Blacks Leisure, Ted Baker and French Connection (where he oversaw the controversial 1990s FCUK advertising campaign) that helped transform the brand and garnered himself a reputation for turning around failing firms.</p>

<span class="hide">"</span></blockquote>
<p>But then a chance meeting in 1993 presented an opportunity to become a part of Manchester City, the football team he had idolised as a boy. “Why I chose them and not United or Liverpool I’m not sure,” he confesses. “Perhaps because of the colours, the sky blue.” As Bernstein remembers, he was “chasing some guy in the north” for a very big personal guarantee for Pentland: “He phoned me and asked if I would like to meet Francis Lee, who was thinking of taking over the club. I said ‘of course’; he was one of my childhood heroes. I met Francis and gave him quite a bit of financial advice, which he didn’t altogether take.”</p>
<p>Lee went ahead with his takeover but found he had gone in under-capitalised and was under pressure immediately. He invited Bernstein to join the board. Far from the petrodollar-funded European powerhouse it is today, Bernstein found a club in financial disrepair. Despite their best efforts, City lurched from crisis to relegation battle. The director and shareholders approached Bernstein and asked if he would replace Lee as chairman, “which was not easy as we had been very close. I had to go to his house with another director on a Saturday morning – I’ll never forget it – and tell him his time was up, he had to go. I don’t quite know how we did it but by Sunday night it was all signed and sealed.” He also admits that their relationship subsequently became a “little bit distant”.</p>
<p>“On the Monday morning I came to Maine Road and I noticed quite a lot of media. I said to our press officer: ‘I think I’d like to handle the media on a one-to-one basis.’ He said: ‘You must be joking, there’s 100 of them out there.’ So I swallowed hard, went out, and it’s amazing what you can do when you have to.”</p>
<p>A period of success followed that included persuading recent England manager Kevin Keegan to take the reins, and the club “never looked back”. Bernstein negotiated the lease for a new, blue, modern stadium — “very much my deal” — which would eventually entice Abu Dhabi royalty to buy the club.</p>
<p>He left in March 2003 after falling out with the board over transfers. He says it was “on matters of principle. I felt members of the board were being seduced into doing rash deals. That tightness, that togetherness we had began to dissipate.”</p>
<p>He joined the board of Wembley Stadium Ltd, eventually becoming chairman, overseeing the construction of the new national stadium following many financial teething problems. Then came his biggest role to date, that of FA chairman.</p>
<p>Bernstein recalls: “2010 was a really difficult year for the FA. The chief executive resigned, the chairman [Lord Triesman] had to go very suddenly for saying things rather unwisely. We had the World Cup debacle and the World Cup bid debacle and on the basis of all that I thought, well, why don’t I have a go?”</p>

</div></div><p>The role has been viewed as something of a poisoned chalice, due to constant media scrutiny, and the constructing power of a self-governing body that has been slow to evolve. So did he hesitate in taking it? “Not really. I knew a lot about it. I knew the people. I’d run a Premier League club so I thought I was well qualified to do it. I quite like being put in those difficult situations. But I must say that the amount of exposure and the things you have to do were probably greater than I imagined.”</p>
<p>Following the Terry incident, the issue of respect, both on and off the field, became central to his leadership. He was asked by David Cameron to head a review of the issues in football. “And we did get the whole of football together on this,” he says. “We signed off a report with nearly 100 recommendations, which I hope are being implemented.”</p>
<p>Again unafraid to make the bold decision, a team headed by Bernstein ignored the media-anointed Harry Redknapp and appointed the more cerebral, but less popular, Roy Hodgson as England manager. Bernstein describes him as: “a particularly civilised guy, well read, intelligent, you can talk to him. We’ve remained friendly, which doesn’t always happen in football.”</p>
<p>He looks back on his time at the FA with pride but no little frustration. “As a fairly reformist chairman and with the government behind us, I thought we could make real progress. In fact, we made some. It got bogged down because there’s a strong reluctance for radical change. It’s like many of these representative self-governing bodies – to get them to change voluntarily is incredibly difficult. It really needs sizable outside pressure from the government or somewhere else.” Despite being out of the game, it’s clear Bernstein is still passionate about the development of the UK’s favourite sport, and the role of the FA in shaping it. His successor Greg Dyke scored an own goal with his first major move as chairman: the recent England Commission report which outlined a radical restructuring of English football, headed by the much-derided “B teams” proposal. It suggested creating a new tier between the non-league conference and professional League Two made up of 10 Premier League B teams and 10 Conference sides, from 2016-17.</p>
<p>“A very silly idea,” says Bernstein. “I don’t think it’s workable. I can see so many problems with it, I’m surprised it ever got on to the table. One of the glories of our game is the breadth of it, the league system, the 92 clubs and the pyramid below it.</p>
<p>“The FA said there are 300,000 volunteers in the bottom tiers. It does a wonderful job in the community and to break that up for this end is just silly. I don’t think it will happen. Some of the questions that have been asked and have not been answered – it really doesn’t bear too much discussion.</p>
<p>“The mistake was having that at the forefront, as it seems to have undermined everything else. I’m not involved now and it’s very easy to be critical from the outside, and I’m trying to stay out of that,” he adds.</p>
<p>As the sums of money flowing into the game, and particularly the English Premier League, become ever more inflated and the worlds of football and finance continue to intertwine, few are better placed to assess the state of football finance. While concerned at the amount of money being spent by clubs, Bernstein is ambivalent over the consequences of Financial Fair Play, the set of regulations designed by European governing body UEFA to stop reckless spending on wages and transfer fees, and curb large cash injections from rich club owners.</p>
<p>He worries that though its intentions are sound, it will only serve to maintain the status quo among the very elite of the European game. “I’m in two minds about it. I’m all for financial responsibility and keeping things in balance but in a way it reduces the romance of the game, the dream of the game.”</p>
<p>But he has no such doubts over the importance of the ACA in preparing him for a career as varied as it has been successful.   “It’s a wonderful qualification. The fact that it makes you financially aware and financially numerate is tremendous. The training is great in the sense that it enables you to switch from one thing to another very quickly: in practice, from one client to another. It’s a great opener, a great doorway. I’m grateful I went down that route and very proud of ICAEW and all it represents.”</p>
<p>He is now chairman of the British Red Cross, another national institution with a strong grassroots base embedded deeply in British society. Keen to get back on to the board of a major organisation, in particular in the voluntary sector, he didn’t hesitate when headhunted for the role. He speaks with pride about the work the organisation does at home and abroad, and those who devote their time to helping others.</p>
<p>His excitement is genuine when discussing the Red Cross and what it can achieve and, when he assures me he has “plenty going on” to fill the days, I believe him. The natural consequence of his career is a contacts book the envy of most in the City, football industry, and even Westminster. But what if that offer to get back in the game were to come along?</p>
<p>“We’ll see about football. You never know what’s round the corner or when the phone’s going to ring. Once you’re involved in football it is very enticing, it can get very frustrating, but it’s a great industry. It would have to be the right situation. I’ve been very lucky so I wouldn’t want a damp squib.”</p>
<p>If the beautiful game calls him back, he shouldn’t be short of offers. After all, what club doesn’t need a safe pair of hands?</p>
