<p class="dropcap">Politicians on all sides have long used the charity sector as a political football. But amid the bluster, some of the recent proposals and announcements for legislation and regulation could have lasting effects on the sector. They include what may turn out to be significant changes, such as the introduction of Social Investment Tax Relief and alterations to Gift Aid, along with changes that will help specific types of organisations, like exemptions on fuel VAT for air ambulances and rescue boats.</p>
<p>The sector has endured hard times in recent years, hit by the recession and public sector spending cuts at a time when, in many cases, those same factors have increased demand for charity services. It has also suffered from some bad publicity: around the turn of the year the Charity Commission (regulator for the sector in England and Wales) took a fearful beating in a report published by the Parliamentary Public Accounts Committee (PAC).</p>
<p>The Commission was criticised for its “feeble” investigation into the Cup Trust scandal, when a registered charity was revealed to have been created solely for the purposes of exploiting a loophole in the Gift Aid system to claim tax relief. The Commission has since pledged to increase significantly the number of charities it subjects to in-depth accounting reviews, but it is also possible that government will, at some stage, consider proposals for reforming regulation of the sector.</p>
<p>There are still some reasons to be cheerful. Figures published by the Charity Commission in May showed that the total income of charities in England and Wales had increased by more than £3bn to £62.8bn in the year to March 2014.</p>
<p>But the latest Almanac published by the National Council for Voluntary Organisations (NCVO) showed that UK charities had lost more than £1.3bn in income (in cash terms, the inflation-adjusted figure is £900m) from government sources between 2010/11 and 2011/12, (the latest figures available), although income through fundraising and donations had increased by £500m. “Any charity is having to deal with the same issues: resources are tighter and demand for their services is rising,” says Andrew O’Brien, senior policy officer at the NCVO. “Some have adapted well and identified opportunities to raise additional income and deploy resources more effectively. Some have not adapted so well.”</p>
<p>Changes to Gift Aid could help many charities. This is worth around £1.06bn to the sector, according to HMRC. Along with sector bodies, it continues to stumble towards simplification of the wording on the Declaration that donors have to sign, a simple measure that could increase donations significantly.</p>
<p>One change already implemented was the launch in spring 2013 of Charities Online, which allows charities and other eligible organisations to claim Gift Aid repayments online rather than by post. By February 2014 the system had already paid claims for £380m of Gift Aid repayments.</p>
<p>Charities reclaim the tax already paid on Gift Aid donations from basic rate taxpayers, but higher rate taxpayers can claim back the difference between their higher tax rate and the basic tax rate for themselves. Many in the sector would like this to change but there could be practical problems, such as the fact that the taxpayer might not want charities to know that they are a higher rate taxpayer.</p>
<p>Others in the sector want to change corporate Gift Aid: since 2000, companies have been allowed to claim the tax relief on their donations, a change made in the hope it would encourage companies to donate more. “Over the past 13 years there’s been no evidence that corporate giving has increased,” says Joe Saxton, driver of ideas at non-profits consultancy nfpSynergy. “Most companies don’t give a huge amount to charity in comparison to their overall turnover, so don’t notice the benefit [of tax relief], whereas it would be of significant benefit to the charity.” In May 2014 research from nfpSynergy showed that Gift Aid on corporate donations could be worth £230m per year to the sector. </p>
<p>The Gift Aid Small Donations Scheme was launched in April 2013 to make it easier for charities and other eligible organisations to claim Gift Aid on small cash donations. The government predicted the scheme would be worth £130m per year to the sector by 2018 but in its first year of operation, up to April 2014, just £7m of claims were made. Saxton believes this is largely a result of the complexity of the system and its onerous eligibility requirements, such as the fact that an organisation  must have a history of successful Gift Aid claims going back  more than two years.</p>
<p>Another new measure, Social Investment Tax Relief, will be available once the Finance Bill passes through Parliament (expected to be in July 2014). Investors can deduct 30% of the cost of their investment from their annual income tax liability, with a minimum investment period of three years. They can also defer capital gains tax (CGT) liabilities if these are invested in a qualifying social investment; and pay no CGT on returns from  the investment itself, although they do pay income tax on dividends or interest.</p>
<p>Eligible organisations need not necessarily be charities but must have “a defined and regulated social purpose”, employ fewer than 500 people and have gross assets worth less than £15m. Under EU rules the organisations can receive no more than €344,827 (approximately £290,000) through these investments over three years, although the investors can invest up to £1m across multiple eligible organisations. “It should enable charities to seek finance more easily than they have done before,” says Nick Brooks, head of not for profit (NFP) at the accountancy firm Kingston Smith and chairman of ICAEW’s Charity and Voluntary Sector Group. “For example, a charity looking to set up a nursing home could seek donations from supporters who would get tax relief on gifts made for those purposes. But charities will have to work out business plans, because this is not a donation. Charities will have to think about how they will pay the money back.”</p>
<p>Helena Wilkinson, head of charities and NFP at Price Bailey and vice chairman of ICAEW’s Charity and Voluntary Sector Group, describes the new relief as “very disappointing”, particularly the investment limit. “I’m not sure there’s going to be much take-up, because it will be easier to pay out grants,” she says.</p>
<p>“You’d have to feel confident that you had revenue coming in to repay that loan,” says Kate Sayer, partner at Sayer Vincent, a firm of chartered accountants that specialises in providing services to charities and NFP organisations. She points out that, in many cases, the cost of professional advice needed to structure the transactions and agreements between investors and these organisations will be prohibitively high for the investor. Of the 500 NFP organisations her company works with, only one, which provides microfinance overseas, has asked for further information about the relief.</p>

<p>Business rates relief for charities brings around £1bn back into the sector. But for how long? This is a relief claimed back from local government, which is facing more significant budget cuts, Brooks points out. He also notes that there has already been discussion in some areas about narrowing the definition of a charitable building.</p>
<p>In 2013 the Welsh government said it was considering cutting this relief for charities from 80% to 50% by 2022, although at the time of writing this seems unlikely to happen.</p>
<p>The sector is currently awaiting the results of a consultation led by HMRC on further measures to stop the tax and regulatory regime for the sector being used for tax avoidance.</p>
<p>One proposal for legislation is that HMRC would not recognise charitable status if “one of the main purposes or results of its establishment is to secure a tax advantage”. In a second, seeking a tax advantage would have to be identifiable as the main purpose of the organisation for it to be denied registration.</p>
<p>“The consultation paper goes too far,” says Brooks. “For example, if you’re setting up a philanthropic trust you could be told you’re taking tax advantage by claiming Gift Aid on donations paid into your foundation.”</p>
<p>Sayer agrees. “Small new charities now have to divulge a lot of information about trustees and their tax affairs; and trustees are required to sign and say they’ve never been involved in any tax avoidance schemes,” she says. “But some lawyers and accountants may have worked on perfectly legal tax planning schemes. That could put them off becoming trustees and small charities really need them.”</p>
<p>A more useful change may be to abolish the requirement for employers to pay Class 1 secondary National Insurance contributions for the under 21s. This will come into force from April 2015, probably with a fairly high earning limit of around £800 per week, so should encourage NFP organisations to employ more young people.</p>
<p>Many third sector organisations will also be grappling with the challenges associated with implementation of auto-enrolment pension arrangements. Others face a different pensions problem: the Charity Commission has identified 740 charities with incomes greater than £500,000 that have a pension scheme deficit.</p>
<p>“Charities’ resources used to plug the deficit can only be taken out of surpluses – you can’t really spend donations on this,” says Saxton. “But if they’re only getting very narrow surpluses – if any – that’s going to be extremely difficult.” Many are also unable to close existing pension arrangements because they are part of multi-employer schemes, often run by local authorities.</p>
<p>Another item that needs to be considered by accountants working with or for charities is the regularly updated Statement  of Recommended Practice (SORP), issued by the Charity Commission and the Office of the Scottish Charity Regulator (OSCR) – the framework for charity accounting and financial reporting. The major change this year is a new modular structure, effectively providing a separate SORP for smaller organisations, based on the Financial Reporting Standard for Smaller Entities.</p>
<p>Those involved in this sector will also be aware of the Lobbying Bill, which became law in January, despite strong opposition from charities concerned that its rules on spending by organisations during the run-up to elections could damage campaigning and fundraising work. The Electoral Commission is due to release further guidance in July. Labour has already said it will repeal the Bill if it wins the 2015 General Election.</p>
<p> “It could have a really detrimental impact,” says Linda Cherrington, finance director at the Motor Neurone Disease Association (MNDA). “We have to raise awareness through campaigning, because there are many people out there who don’t understand the disease and how critical it is that people have the right care at the right time – life expectancy at diagnosis is 15 months. We’re a young charity and are heavily dependent upon fundraising and campaigns.”</p>
<p>Asheem Singh, director of policy at the Charity Leaders Network ACEVO, is unequivocal. “The lobbying act was a legislative aberration,” he says. “At ACEVO we support the principle of transparency, but the way to achieve this was absolutely not by gagging charities and campaign groups. It is a stain on our democracy that we have imposed limits on the free speech of representative groups.”</p>
<p>Finally, if you were looking for something that organisations of every shape and size throughout the sector might agree on, it would be the need to reduce red tape.</p>
<p>“We must be clear: no more red tape for charities,” says  Singh. “In order to keep on delivering quality services,  especially in partnership with government, we need a moratorium on new regulations. Subjecting charities to additional burdens through Freedom of Information laws  would be a huge injustice.</p>
<p>“Furthermore, we need government to recognise our right  to speak up on behalf of the voiceless and vulnerable, so we must resist gagging clauses in contracts and name and shame departments that insist on them.” The sector continues to support countless good causes across our society: it’s a  shame that some politicians and government agencies don’t always provide the support it needs to complete those tasks more effectively.</p>
