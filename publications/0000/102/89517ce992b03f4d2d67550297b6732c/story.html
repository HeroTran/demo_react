<h2>SHREDDED: INSIDE RBS, THE BANK THAT BROKE BRITAIN IAN FRASER  (BIRLINN, £20)</h2><p>Anyone squeamish about the financial excesses of the pre-2008 boom, or the painful crash that followed, should look away now. As a financial journalist living and working in Scotland throughout the boom and crisis, it is inevitable that Fraser would want to turn his investigative beam on RBS. And he has been kept busy doing just that for the last few years, writing extensively on the banking crisis and the role RBS played in it. What was less certain was how sharp or relevant the book, when it came, would be. A lack of distance makes it somehow more difficult to afford recent events the same respect and quality of thought we afford more distant history. Fraser certainly pulls no punches here. The story of the hubris-heavy rise and painful fall of politicians’ former favourite banker Fred Goodwin and the empire he built is laid bare in all its gory details. </p>
<p>In fact Fraser goes much further back in time, right back to the bank’s foundation, rather than just focusing on recent events. At times this is more like a biography of the bank. While this historical context is useful and vital to the retelling of the later (more recent) events, there is an inevitable danger that either the reader (and sometimes the writer) get caught up in the excitement. Some blameless novices among the earliest characters tend to be coloured somewhat by their association with the bank that would become the scandal-hit RBS of 2008.</p>
<p>If there is plenty here to make squeamish bankers (do they exist?) look away, accountants (and auditors especially) also come in for some fairly hefty criticism. Fraser has been accused in the past of selecting the facts that best support his worldview; he argues that the facts speak for themselves and need little editing. But by selecting such a loaded and provocative title, it is clear he isn’t in this to offer a job reference for future employers of Fred Goodwin. It’s an enjoyable book and one that will upset as many as it infuriates.</p>
<h2>BOLT FROM THE BLUE: NAVIGATING THE NEW WORLD OF CORPORATE CRISES MIKE PULLEN AND JOHN BRODIE DONALD (ELLIOTT &amp; THOMPSON, £20)</h2><p>What connects RBS with Tesco, BP with Nasa and Domino’s Pizza with Lehman Brothers? Nothing immediate, apart from the fact that all of them have experienced some sort of sudden crisis in what the authors describe as a “bolt from the blue”. Whether these events should be as shocking to senior management as they often end up being is one issue raised here.</p>
<p>But the real focus of the book is what these and other crisis case studies teach about how a modern corporate catastrophe should be handled. Whether the issue is horsemeat in burgers or an exploding oil well, there are useful tips for all here.</p>
