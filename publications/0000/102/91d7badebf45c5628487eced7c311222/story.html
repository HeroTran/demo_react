<h2><b>AUDIT</b></h2><h2>EU reforms need clarification</h2><p>Some businesses in Europe are still in the dark about implementation of the EU audit reforms despite publication of the legislation in the Official Journal (OJ).</p>
<p>“There are still areas that require clarification and ICAEW is in regular contact with the government, firms and other stakeholders to identify those areas,” said Tony Bromell, head of integrity and markets at ICAEW.</p>
<p>An explanatory memorandum was expected at the same time as the regulation and directive appeared in the OJ but has now been deferred until later in the year.</p>
<p>Some of the more immediate questions revolve around the approaches different member states will take to the length of time they will allow before insisting on mandatory rotation of audit firms.</p>
<p>The new EU law offers flexibility over rotation timing provided companies tender their audit every  10 years, so member states may opt to introduce different periods. The maximum for sole auditors can be extended to 20 years while in the case of a joint audit 24 years is allowed. Given the UK government’s current policy of deregulation, it seems likely it will exercise the most liberal option.</p>
<p>Variation in timings could prove tricky for groups with headquarters and subsidiaries in different member states. It is also unclear about when rotation actually kicks in – there are specific transitional provisions for companies with the same auditors for a long time but, oddly, they are silent on when the provisions have effect for companies which have changed their auditor in the last 10 years.</p>
<h2><b>EMPLOYMENT</b></h2><h2>EC ruling on commission pay</h2><p>Employers who pay commission on top of salaries to employees but do not include it in statutory holiday pay may find that they face claims for additional pay backdated to 1998, following a European Court decision.</p>
<p>In Lock v British Gas, the court decided that the Working Time Directive (WTD) requires commission earned by staff to be taken into account when calculating holiday pay. Z J Lock, who was a British Gas sales consultant, took his employer to the Employment Tribunal because when he took his holidays, his salary dropped by some 40% because British Gas only gave him basic pay when he wasn’t earning commission.</p>
<p>The tribunal forwarded the question of whether holiday pay should include commission under the WTD to the European Court. The court decided that as commission is intrinsically linked to performance of the activities the employee is obliged to perform under a contract of employment, the employer had to take it into account in calculating holiday pay.</p>
<p>KPMG says that businesses may have to brace themselves for mass claims dating back to 1998 which was when the WTD was implemented in UK law.</p>
<p>It also warns that the Lock case is “far from the end of the story. There is a clear direction of travel regarding holiday pay and employers with sizeable workforces, atypical working patterns and/or recurring variable elements of pay in particular need to be aware.</p>
<p>“What is emerging as a rule of thumb is that if an employee  regularly takes home pay which is above his or her basic rate, that  needs to be considered in the holiday pay calculation.”</p>
<p>As well as the increased wages bill, employers will have to negotiate with HMRC over the tax due on the backdated pay – which may well incur interest and penalties as well.</p>
<h2><b>FINANCIAL REPORTING</b></h2><h2>FRC settles standards wrangle</h2><p>The Financial Reporting Council has put an end to the recent spat with a group of investors over the legality under UK law of using certain international accounting standards. It has issued a statement reconfirming that the presentation of a true and fair view remains a fundamental requirement of financial reporting.</p>
<p>In the vast majority of cases, the regulator says, a true and fair view will be achieved by compliance with accounting standards and by additional disclosure to explain an issue fully. “However, where compliance with an accounting standard would result in accounts being so misleading that they would conflict with the objectives of financial statements, the standard should be overridden.”</p>
<p>It adds that it will continue to discharge its responsibilities in relation to the monitoring and enforcement of reporting on that basis.</p>
<h2>ICAEW calls for clarity on CCR</h2><p>ICAEW has written to the government to express serious concern about the proposals for implementing country-by-country reporting. It is worried about the wording of the final regulations, given the lack of clarity in certain parts of the underlying EU accounting directive, and it urges the government to pay attention to a number of areas including the impact on group companies and the problems over the requirement to report information on a cash basis when companies’ accounting systems are accruals-based.</p>
<p>In the letter, ICAEW says that, while it strongly supports the government’s commitment to introduce transparency over payments made by companies to governments of resource-rich countries, “the regulation needs to be absolutely clear if it is to achieve its purpose”.</p>
<p>It points to the proposed requirement that large companies involved in mining oil, minerals and gas or logging will have to produce an extractives report. This may cause “significant challenges” for many companies in collecting and collating relevant information.</p>
<p>“Under the new rules, payments made to governments must be reported on a cash (rather than an accruals) basis,” it says. “This is not made sufficiently clear in the draft regulations. In our opinion, this is a critical point for companies to understand, not only because it will impact the figures reported but also because it is likely to represent a significant challenge when they start to collate the required information – company accounting systems are accruals based.”</p>
<p>ICAEW thinks it likely that companies will have to introduce separate systems to account for the payments since normal accounting systems may not be able to deal with such reporting.</p>

<h2>Consultation on investment entities</h2><p>The International Accounting Standards Board has issued for consultation proposed amendments to IFRS 10, Consolidated financial statements, and IAS 28, Investments in associates and join ventures.</p>
<p>They are intended to clarify three issues about the application of the requirement for investment entities to measure subsidiaries at fair value instead of consolidating them.</p>
<p>The deadline for comments on Investment entities – applying the consolidation exception – is 15 September 2014.</p>

<h2><b>IT</b></h2><h2>Improving spreadsheet practice</h2><p>The ICAEW IT Faculty has launched a major new publication on better spreadsheet thinking and practice.</p>
<p>According to Twenty principles for good spreadsheet practice, around 90% of spreadsheets contain mistakes, ranging from minor to material errors such as incorrect models or careless use of formulae, often because 65% of Excel users are self-taught.</p>
<p>“Many spreadsheets evolve over time without well-structured design or integrity checks and are poorly documented,” it says. “Making a relatively simple change can often take a long time, have unexpected consequences and/or result in errors from incorrect calculations or input assumptions.”</p>
<p>The 20 principles are aimed at reducing spreadsheet risk and inefficiency in organisations both large and small. They are not comprehensive but focus on traditional formula-driven spreadsheet construction, and are intended to be widely applicable to “projects of all shapes and sizes and degrees of complexity”.</p>
<p>The IT Faculty has also provided a resource page that contains the principles and an introductory film.</p>

<h2><b>TAX</b></h2><h2>Service standards left wanting</h2><p>HMRC may have improved its service standards since they hit rock bottom three years ago but they are still not at acceptable levels, ICAEW has told exchequer secretary David Gauke.</p>
<p>He has also been left in no doubt how Tax Faculty members feel  about HMRC chasing incorrect RTI liabilities and the proposed new power to collect tax debts direct  from bank accounts.</p>
<p>Commenting on HMRC’s Q4 2013 performance statistics, the faculty described as “disappointing” the fact that overall telephone call performance had fallen by 5.4% when compared with Q4 2012. And while the number of telephone calls to HMRC contact centres handled within five minutes was up by 24.2% (v Q3 2013), this still meant a success rate of just 66.6%.</p>
<p>The faculty wants to see an increase in front line staff answering phone calls at peak times of the year. HMRC’s plans to work towards handling 90% of calls across all helplines are welcome, it says, although the proposed level of at least 80% during 2014/15 is too low. This should be “at least 90% and ideally 95%”.</p>
<p>On RTI, the faculty raised the issue that employers and their agents cannot see the same information online that HMRC can see relating to PAYE due and paid. This is “resulting in unnecessary and frustrating telephone calls when disputes arise”, says Paul Aplin, chairman of the faculty’s technical committee. “It is unhelpful to have a system in which employers are required to report PAYE in real time but in which  the PAYE information they can actually see online is only updated a couple of times a month.”</p>
<p>Gauke was also told that the power to collect tax debts from bank accounts was “excessive” and bound to lead to mistakes with potentially serious consequences.</p>
<h2>Close company loans reform dropped</h2><p>The government has announced that it will not go ahead with fundamental reform of the close company loan participators rules.</p>
<p>Responses to the consultation last year made it clear that the options under consideration might impact badly on SMEs, wealth creation and on the UK economy.</p>
<p>Instead, it says, HMRC will explore options for publishing a non-statutory form to reduce processing delays with claims for repayment, and continue to engage with interested parties to consider in more detail suggestions put forward during the consultation process which might result in smaller adjustments to the regime within its existing framework.</p>
