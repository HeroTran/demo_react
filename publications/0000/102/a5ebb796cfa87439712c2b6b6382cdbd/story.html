<h2>BIRTHDAY HONOURS FOR ICAEW MEMBERS</h2><p>Former ICAEW president Keith Woodley is one of nine ICAEW members to receive awards in this year’s Birthday Honours List.</p>
<p>Woodley, who was president in 1995/96, stepped down last year as pro-Chancellor of Bath University and a member of its council after nearly 20 years of service. His CBE was for services to higher education.</p>
<p>Four other members received CBEs. They include: Jane Barker, chief executive of Equitas, for services to the financial and insurance services industries and voluntary service; Peter Hensman, chairman of Cumbria Rural Enterprise Agency, for voluntary service to the rural economy in Cumbria; and Edward Leask, who teaches sailing part-time to youngsters at the Weymouth and Portland National Sailing Academy, for services to sailing, young people and philanthropy. Sharmila Nebhrajani, chief executive of the Association of Medical Research Charities, receives her CBE for services to medical research.</p>
<p>MBEs went to Hallam Carter Pegg for services to young people in Croydon and to Glenn Crocker, chief executive of BioCity Nottingham, for services to the biotechnology industry, while OBEs went to Dharam Bir Lall for services to the community and businesses in Essex and the London Borough of Newham, and to Alan Wintersgill, for services to charity and to the community in Bingley, West Yorkshire.</p>
<h2>NEW MAN AT THE TOP</h2><p>Business consultant Arthur Bailey has taken over as ICAEW president from former Deloitte partner Martyn Jones. He will be supported during his year in office  by PwC audit partner Andrew Ratcliffe as deputy president and Open University lecturer Hilary Lindsay as vice president.</p>
<p>Speaking at his inaugural lunch, Bailey said that being a chartered accountant must have been in his stars and that appropriately enough he qualified the same year that the first man walked on the moon. “I have always been passionate about what the profession does for business and for society,” he confessed. “I count myself extremely lucky to have lived through an era in which our profession has spread around the globe, and where our skills are in many ways more and more in demand.</p>
<p>“We are a hugely dynamic and relevant profession – to the economy, to business, to the public sector.”</p>
<h2>FEES AND SUBS TO RISE</h2><p>Annual fees and subscriptions are to rise next year after ICAEW members voted overwhelmingly in support at the AGM and special meeting in June. This means that subs will go up by £10 to £340 while the admission fee for those living in the UK or Europe will increase by £18 to £626 and for those elsewhere by £9 to £313.</p>
<p>Practising certificates will also be more expensive in 2015. For those living in the UK or Europe, the fee will be £161 (up from £156) and outside £74 (up from £72).</p>
<h2>APP FOR MEMBERS LAUNCHED</h2><p>ICAEW has launched an app for members, which brings together different parts of ICAEW digital offerings, including tax tables, news and analysis from economia and contact details for fellow members.</p>
<p>It also provides access to member benefits, including commercial benefits offered by ICAEW’s affinity partners, and can be used as a membership card.</p>
<p>“We wanted to build an app that would offer something to all our members,” said ICAEW head of digital Faye Thomassen, “and we look forward to hearing feedback and potential features for future versions.”</p>
<p>The app, which is currently only available on iPhone or iPad, can be downloaded from the Apple Store.</p>
