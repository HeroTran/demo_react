<h2>QUEEN'S SPEECH HIGHLIGHTS</h2><p>In the last Queen’s Speech before the General Election, 11 new Bills were announced. They include:</p>
<p>A Small Business, Enterprise and Employment Bill to make it easier for SMEs to get finance, give them fairer access to public sector contracts, and introduce higher penalties for those who fail to pay the minimum wage.</p>
<p>National Insurance Contributions Bill to simplify the collection of class 2 NICs and boost anti-avoidance measures.</p>
<p>Infrastructure Bill to facilitate fracking, speed up infrastructure projects and reform planning laws.</p>
<p>Pensions Tax Bill to allow individuals access to defined contribution pension savings, open up the annuity market and bring in pensions anti-avoidance provisions.</p>
<p>Private Pensions Bill to give employees more control over their pension funds.</p>
<p>Serious Crime Bill to target people who knowingly participate in organised crime groups, including accountants facilitating money laundering.</p>
<h2>AUDITOR AND AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORTS VARY IN VALUE</h2><p>A KPMG survey of the audit committee reports of the first 134 FTSE 350 companies to publish accounts under the new reporting regime has found wide variations.</p>
<p>While the most common risks mentioned by audit committees were impairment, taxation, provisions and revenue recognition, the largest category after impairment risks was “other”, which appeared 38 times. A significant proportion of these were one-offs and often related to accounting judgements.</p>
<p>KPMG also found major variations in the extended auditor reports. For example, there were good examples of disclosure of judgements and estimates corresponding to audit risks which were not only detailed on the nature of the subjective factors but also quantified as to sensitivity.</p>
<p>However KPMG said, “This quality of disclosure was not universally available. In fact, around half of all cases saw some shortfall in matters disclosed by the accounts compared with the audit report.”</p>

<h2>NEW JOINT REVENUE RECOGNITION STANDARD</h2><p>The International Accounting Standards Board and the US Financial Accounting Standards Board have jointly issued a standard on revenue recognition.</p>
<p>“Until now, there have been significant differences in how and when revenue has been recognised and reported under IFRS and US GAAP, which has made it difficult to compare reported revenues across companies, industries and capital markets,” said Nigel Sleigh-Johnson, head of ICAEW’s Financial Reporting Faculty.</p>
<p>The standard will require companies to show the transfer of goods or services to customers in amounts that reflect the consideration the company expects to be entitled to in exchange. It will also lead to enhanced disclosure about revenue, give guidance for transactions not previously addressed comprehensively, and improve guidance for multiple-element arrangements.</p>

<h2>GUIDANCE ON SERVICE CHARGE EXPENDITURE</h2><p>ICAEW has issued a technical release setting out best practice in the conduct of a review engagement in the context of independent accountants’ reports on the annual statement of service charge expenditure   in commercial property.</p>
<p>In the past there has been “widespread” inconsistency in the wording of these reports, which may have confused the occupiers of commercial properties as to what underlying procedures were performed and the level of assurance offered. The new guidance (TECH 09/14BL) should bring greater consistency to procedures and reporting and improve occupier satisfaction.</p>
<p>It applies to reports on statements of service charge expenditure for periods starting on or after 1 April 2014, although earlier implementation is encouraged.</p>

<h2>CYBER SECURITY ACCREDITATION LAUNCHED</h2><p>UK businesses will be able to gain accreditation for having cyber protection in place under a new government scheme. From 1 October the accreditation will be mandatory for suppliers bidding for government contracts covering sensitive and personal information handling.</p>
<p>Industry feedback suggests many SMEs have been put off implementing cyber security plans because of time, costs and confusing advice from different bodies.</p>
<p>The new scheme – Cyber Essentials – focuses on five essential mitigation strategies, providing clear guidance on implementation. The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills is also extending its voucher scheme so that businesses will be able to defray costs.</p>
<p>BIS argues that accreditation provides a metric against which businesses can measure their cyber security maturity.</p>
