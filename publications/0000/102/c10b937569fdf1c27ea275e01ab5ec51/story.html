<p class="dropcap">To drive away a bear you need more than a rolled-up newspaper. On the surface, this appears to be what the United States and Europe are attempting to use with a series of puny sanctions against Russia following its annexation of Crimea. Blacklisting a coterie of plutocrats and officials is no way to intimidate a nation with the world’s seventh largest economy, sceptics have argued.</p>
<p>What’s more, Russia enjoys vast oil revenues as the world’s second largest exporter of crude, shipping at least three times more than Iran at its peak. The nation also accounts for a third of Europe’s gas imports, making it hard to push around. Yet Russia may be deceptively vulnerable.</p>
<p>“Russia is in no shape to withstand an economic siege,” says Anders Aslund, a former adviser to the Kremlin and now a fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. “Not only has the country been badly mismanaged, it is also extremely reliant on the international financial system. The upshot is that carefully designed sanctions have the ability to inflict massive economic harm on Russia.”</p>
<p>Even the mild slap administered by the US and Europe has been sufficient to send $50bn (£30bn) of capital fleeing from the country in the first months of 2014. And Russia’s economics ministry has slashed its growth forecast from 2.5% to just 1%. Without a diplomatic détente, the outlook may get even grimmer.</p>
<p>When President Vladimir Putin decided to annex Crimea, it is likely that politics rather than economics were at the forefront of his mind. This demonstration of Russian machismo has been doing wonders for his approval rating, driving it up to 72% from last year’s 62%, according to VTsIOM, the All-Russian Center for the Study of Public Opinion.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the region itself is likely to prove an economic burden. Crimea is poor, with a GDP per capita on a par with the least developed areas of Russia, such as the turbulent Chechnya. It produces just one tenth of the energy it consumes and was heavily dependent on the central government of Ukraine for finance. This helps explain why the Kremlin has already earmarked $7bn (£4bn) in economic aid for the peninsula this year. The money will be spent on infrastructure and beefed up pensions for local residents.</p>
<p>Such burdens pale, however, compared to the possible economic fallout from well-targeted sanctions. If the crisis escalates, the World Bank believes that the Russian economy could contract by nearly 2% in 2014 – a loss of around $30bn (£18bn) in output. Former Russian finance minister Alexei Kudrin has said the Ukraine crisis could lead to $160bn (£96bn) of capital outflow this year, enough for the economy to stagnate.</p>
<p>The trick will be to ensure that sanctions inflict maximum damage on Russia while minimising the risk of harm to the US or the rest of Europe. That rules out certain obvious ways of punishing Putin.</p>

<p>A boycott of Russian gas and oil might bring the country to heel. But the cost to rich nations would be immense. “The world was able to live without Iran’s 2.2m barrels of oil a day,” says Tom Biracree, an energy analyst at consultancy IHS. “Cutting off Russia’s 7.7m barrels a day of exports would send fuel prices soaring across the globe.” What is more, an embargo on Russian oil could never be complete. “If an embargo pushed up global prices, Russia would merely sell less oil but get a higher price per barrel. It wouldn’t suffer any net fall in income,” says Biracree.</p>
<p>Even a more limited ban on purchases of Russian gas is economically unthinkable for Europe. A third of Europe’s gas imports come from Russia. “Stop the flow and electricity prices in Europe would jump dramatically,” Biracree adds. “This would have a chilling effect on the zone’s economy.”</p>
<h2>A MORE SUBTLE APPROACH</h2><p>None of this means that Russia’s energy sector can’t be touched. As the source of half of government revenue in 2012 and about 70% of export earnings, it is an obvious target. And there are ways that more subtle sanctions could undermine Russia’s hydrocarbon industry over the long term. Russian energy firms are less technologically sophisticated than their big western rivals, such as Royal Dutch Shell or Exxon Mobil, and have less ready access to capital. That makes foreign participation crucial to keeping the industry in good health.</p>
<p>“Many of the nation’s oil fields are now very old and so even keeping production stable will be a struggle,” says Adnan Vatansever, a senior lecturer on energy at King’s College London. “That will require raising a lot of money and also attracting plenty of foreign investment. Both will be far harder   if Russia becomes an international pariah.”</p>
<p>Even the relatively mild sanctions could prove a problem for the Russian energy sector. Igor Sechin, the chief executive of Russia’s largest oil producer Rosneft, was among those targeted by US sanctions. The company has worked with America’s Exxon Mobil to develop Russian reserves in the Arctic. But such deals with foreign oil firms may be harder to negotiate if diplomatic tensions remain high. That would slow the development of the nation’s reserves.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Russia’s sales of gas are being put at risk. “There is not much that Europe can do in the short term to reduce reliance on Russian gas,” says Vatansever. “Still, energy ministers have already started to consider alternatives – including liquefied natural gas from the US, where supplies are abundant.” Since gas sales to Europe account for 14% of Russia’s export earnings, this is not a threat Putin’s government can afford to take lightly.</p>
<p>Potentially sanctions could go further by banning large oil service companies, such as Halliburton and Schlumberger, from lending their expertise to Russia, says Vatansever. “Over the long term, this would undermine Russia’s oil and gas output.”</p>
<h2>ENCOURAGEMENT TO COMPROMISE</h2><p>An even more effective way of deterring Russia without harming the global economy may be through financial sanctions, argues Juan Zarate, author of Treasury’s War: The Unleashing of a New Era of Financial Warfare. There is good evidence that clamping down on banks and freezing assets has helped restrain other bellicose nations, he says. Freezing North Korea’s assets in a Macau bank in 2005 encouraged the nation to return to the negotiating table. Meanwhile, targeting banks and firms with connections to Iran’s Revolutionary Guard also appears to have made the country more amenable to compromise.</p>
<p>This approach could be even more powerful with Russia. “The nation is extremely reliant on the global financial system,” says Aslund. “If Russian businesses want loans or to raise money in equity markets, they tend to do so abroad. The reason is that they do not trust the legal system at home to protect their property rights or enforce contracts.” About 70 Russian companies are listed in London, for example.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a World Bank report recently showed that Russia had $732bn (£437bn) in foreign debt. That included almost $300bn (£179bn) owed by state-controlled banks and other government-owned companies. “If sanctions are extended it could be hard to renew these loans, causing considerable financial disruption,” says Aslund. In an extreme case, experts believe that sanctions could cause a “Lehman-like” financial meltdown in Russia.</p>

</div></div><p>Again, Zarate believes that a subtle approach is best. He says simply freezing the assets of individuals or banks without cause would be legally dubious – resulting in endless court actions. “Much the same effect can be achieved through conduct-based financial isolation,” he says. “This would entail really aggressive investigations into the money laundering, corruption and tax evasion by Russian individuals or banks.”</p>
<p>The US Treasury has already started to experiment with this approach. On 8 May, the US imposed sanctions on Moscow-based Tempbank for allegedly financing arms shipments to the Syrian regime of Bashar al-Assad.</p>
<p>The advantage of this tactic is that it is easier to secure collaboration from financial institutions and avoid legal problems. “All global banks have mechanisms set up to deal with these kinds of illicit activity,” Zarate says. “None want to take the risk of having their reputations tarnished.”</p>
<p>The other merit of this approach, Zarate says, is that it is extremely flexible. In an ideal world the authorities would always be aggressively pursuing such wrongdoing. In reality, the US can ratchet up or down such policing actions very quickly.  “If Russia starts to behave better, it is easy to call off the dogs,” Zarate points out. The international role of the dollar provides the US with another trump card. Sanctions against Bank Rossiya, the first bank to be sanctioned, ensured that it could no longer engage in foreign exchange operations – a crippling blow. Although Rossiya is not a significant financial institution, it gave Russia a hint of the damage that could be inflicted if a major bank were shut out of the dollar-based global system.</p>
<h2>UNDERLYING ECONOMIC WEAKNESS</h2><p>Any nation would be susceptible to such measures. But Russia’s economy was fragile even before the Crimean crisis, says Neil Shearing, the chief emerging markets economist at consultancy Capital Economics. Economic growth has slumped from a peak of 9% in 2007 when Russia was seen as a promising BRIC nation, to just 1.3% in 2009. “Putin has been a lazy manager of Russia – relying on high oil prices to get by while allowing the underlying structure of the economy to disintegrate,” Shearing says.</p>
<p>For a start, Russia has permitted its oil and gas bounty to displace other manufacturing – a phenomenon known as the Dutch disease. Over the past decade the nation’s effective exchange rate has climbed by around 60%, largely the result of strong crude revenues, according to Capital Economics. That has made it harder for other industries to sell their wares overseas. The result is that manufacturing now accounts for just 13% of GDP, down from nearly 16% in 2004. “This is storing up problems for the future, especially if oil prices fall,” says Shearing. “High oil prices are now a necessity and not a luxury for Russia.”</p>
<p>Other flaws in Russia’s economy make it unusually reliant on outside investment and expertise. Aside from hydrocarbons, the nation has few strengths. “Growth has been constrained by Russia’s large number of inefficient companies – often the legacy of Communism,” says Shearing. “Much of the industrial capacity was built during Soviet times and is now outdated.” The nation is dotted with “mono-towns” – towns reliant on a single factory that is often loss making and supported by government subsidies. To stand any hope of turning this around, Russia will need the collaboration of foreign companies and investors.</p>
<p>Russia has also been suffering from a brain drain. “The nation is experiencing a shortage of highly-skilled professionals,” says Shearing. A recent report by human resources firm Antal Russia concluded that nearly 90% of companies were struggling to find high-skilled workers.</p>
<blockquote class="right" ><span class="hide">"</span><p>Sanctions against Bank Rossiya showed Russia the damage that could be inflicted if a major bank were shut out of the dollar-based global system</p>
<span class="hide">"</span></blockquote>
<p>These limitations mean that even before the crisis over Ukraine, Russia was on track to grow by just 2% or 2.5% a year, according to Capital Economics, an extremely slow rate for an emerging nation. “Russia would now be far less vulnerable had Putin spent years reforming the Russian economy, cutting red tape, trimming state subsidies, and ensuring that Russian businesses were able to raise capital at home,” says Shearing. “As things stand, however, Russia would pay a heavy price for even a brief period of economic isolation.”</p>
<p>Of course, punishing Russia is not without costs for the US and Europe. In recent years the nation had cooperated in the campaign to put financial pressure on Iran. Aside from withdrawing such support, Russia could deploy more covert tools. The Kremlin has used cyber attacks against Georgia and may be willing to enlist hackers to damage western companies or governments.</p>
<p>That said, it is very unlikely that Russia will use its big energy weapon – cutting off gas or oil supplies. “This would be the economic equivalent of the nuclear bomb,” says Aslund.</p>
<p>Russia is by far the most formidable nation to be targeted by US sanctions since the end of the Cold War in the 1990s. Yet such measures are not necessary to bring Russia to its knees, says Zarate. “Sanctions merely need to show Putin and his coterie that the financial costs of territorial aggression outweigh the political benefits,” he argues. “Carefully-designed measures are more than able to do this.”</p>
<p>In the short term, Putin’s popularity has climbed as a result of his muscular foreign policy. This would most likely shift, however, after several years of sluggish economic growth or recession. Even if the population at large continued to back the macho president, the oligarchs that surround him have become increasingly international – aspiring to create global companies. If they start to feel that Putin has become a liability, the president’s days would be numbered.</p>
