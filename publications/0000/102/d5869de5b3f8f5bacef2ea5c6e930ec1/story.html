<h2>BREAKFAST</h2><h2><b>The Scottish Café &amp; Restaurant, Scottish National Gallery, Edinburgh</b></h2><p>As owners of the excellent Edinburgh-based Contini Ristorante, Victor and Carina Contini were always keen to celebrate the Scottish side of their heritage – and the famed Scottish larder. Five years ago, they took on the National Gallery site, sourcing ingredients from more than 60 artisan Scottish producers, and two years ago, they renovated a one-acre garden in the nearby Esk Valley to grow their own fruit and vegetables. The result is the sort of national monument café that every city should aspire to: local, seasonal, sustainable and delicious. At breakfast, the Aberdeen buttery – a Scottish speciality somewhere between crusty breakfast roll and croissant – is a thing of beauty, particularly with Clava Brie, Isle of Mull cheddar, their own ham and homemade chutney. Dining offers a glorious view of Princes Street Gardens – where the Contini’s have their herb patch.</p>

<h2>LUNCH</h2><h2><b>Grain Store, King’s Cross, London</b></h2><p>Bruno Loubet’s Grain Store is just damned good. The National Restaurant Awards judges declared it the UK’s Most Sustainable Restaurant last year. Cynics might point out that meat comes all the way from Denham Estate in Suffolk and Lake District Farmers in Cumbria. But the response to that is simple: Grain Store is “quasi-vegetarian”. Meat features only as a garnish in a handful of dishes.    It’s seasonal veg that gets the starring role in this nicely-lit, open room, be it white asparagus crusted with sesame seeds, silken tofu and wild garlic, or braised endives filled with quinoa, wood roast onions and Toulouse sausage ragout. Grain Store is proof that healthy and worthy can also be fun and tasty.</p>

<h2>DINNER</h2><h2><b>Summer Lodge Hotel, Evershot, Dorset</b></h2><p>On the US east coast, particularly in Maine, local and seasonal is not a trend; it’s just the freshest, tastiest, most logical thing. A fine exponent of that philosophy is Maine’s White Barn Inn. And one of its former chefs, Steven Titman, is now running a kitchen in Dorset using local meat, fish and produce – often from Summer Lodge’s own garden. Look out for the cress addition to a superlative warm salad of Lyme Bay mackerel   with beetroot. Local woodland-reared chicken spoke of a bird that had a decent run among the trees, a risotto of fine herbs with English asparagus and poached free-range egg ticked all the right boxes, and of the 27 cheeses on the menu, 26 are from the south-west.</p>
