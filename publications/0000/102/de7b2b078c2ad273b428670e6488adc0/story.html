<p class="dropcap">Becoming president has made me think back to the time when I was a school leaver and in a quandary over what to do as a career. With a choice between banking or chartered accountancy, I plumped for the latter – a lucky move, as it turned out. I have to confess I had no understanding of the difference chartered accountants make every day when I started out but I soon realised how hugely relevant we are to business. As you know, today we advise 1.5m – that’s a third – of  all UK businesses.</p>
<p class="dropcap">We are also making a huge contribution to training and equipping young people from all walks of life with the skills to take advantage of the opportunities available in business. Forgive me if I get on my hobbyhorse, but this is not just of fundamental importance for the future of the profession, but personal as well.</p>
<p class="dropcap">As an 18-year-old, I was articled to an individual in a four-partner practice, effectively doing what we now call an apprenticeship. He was hugely important to my training and development. He was the person I talked to, who mentored me as far as work and professional ethics was concerned. I learned from him high ethical standards and an appreciation of what it means to belong to a respected profession.</p>
<p class="dropcap">So over the past few years I’ve been pleased to see the increasing contribution that ICAEW and the profession are making to young people’s development. Many of you are mentoring 16 to 19-year-olds through BASE, our national business game. ICAEW is involved closely in the Access Accountancy campaign to encourage school leavers to train in the profession; and we are currently opening up new routes into training.</p>
<p class="dropcap">I’m particularly delighted with the recent introduction – or should I say reintroduction? – of authorised training principals, which means that individual ICAEW members working in non-ICAEW firms can  train chartered accountants. It’s interesting how things have gone full circle and we are getting back to our roots on apprenticeships.</p>
<p class="dropcap">Even though the ATP scheme was set up only comparatively recently, we already have 18 members signed up and more in the pipeline. The offices they work in vary from commercial organisations (eight) to financial services (seven) and not-for profit or government bodies (three). It’s a great start and I hope many more of you will consider joining the scheme and playing your own part in shaping the future of the profession. After all, who knows, you might find yourself mentoring an equally grateful ICAEW president some years down the line.</p>
