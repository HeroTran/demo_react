<p class="dropcap">Eat enough kale, and you could live to be 140 – or    so the findings of a recent University College London study would have us believe.</p>
<p>Whether you’re following the path to inner peas, or would rather drown in chip fat than pout for a sprout, the reality is we could all benefit from eating more unprocessed vegetables.</p>
<p>And we are talking vegetables here: fruit may be part of the seven-a-day advice, but the real health benefits lie in the green (and orange and red and purple and white) stuff without all the sugar.</p>
<p>Mainlining grapes and apple juice will have the same affect on your body as chewing sugar cubes – spiking insulin levels, promoting fat storage and fast-tracking you to a range of severe health problems.</p>
<p>Veg, meanwhile, will not. But at 80g per portion, there is a limit to how much virtuous roughage we can fit on a plate. With that in mind, here are some ideas of how to get more servings in without really noticing.</p>
<h2>CAULIFLOWER</h2><p><b>Daily serving: 8 florets</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Cauliflower may look like a brain and smell a bit funky, but it’s incredibly versatile. It contains oestrogen-reducing plant sterols and is a great source of vitamin C. Steam it and mash with butter and you’ve got a shepherds  pie topping or the perfect companion to a helping of sausages. Grate it or pulse briefly in a food processor and it will form rice-sized grains, ideal for fried rice, with curry or even in risotto – and it cooks a lot quicker. Tossed in olive oil, salt and pepper and baked in the oven, cauliflower florets are a crispy, crunchy addition to the Sunday roast.</p>
<h2>COURGETTE</h2><p><b>Daily serving: ½ a large one</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Who needs spaghetti when you have courgettes? Julienned with a peeler then sliced into strips, or even put through a specialised ‘spiraliser’, they’re delicious stir-fried with a  little garlic and olive oil, or pesto.  Just top with your favourite protein or pasta sauce and you’re set. Top tip: press the noodles between kitchen paper to remove excess moisture. The moisture is brilliant, however, for baking. Mix grated courgette into banana bread or brownies and it will add potassium, good for reducing blood pressure,    as well as great texture.</p>
<h2>SPINACH</h2><p><b>Daily serving: 1 small bowl, fresh</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Throw a serving of spinach in with your scrambled eggs, layer it under salmon, stir it into stews, substitute it for lettuce in salad – this is a green that goes with any meal. Spinach is a powerhouse of disease-preventing phytonutrients and soluble dietary fibre. Even better, it wilts down to nothing in seconds, so you can get in a lot of leaves in a few mouthfuls. Cooked up with leeks, savoy cabbage, nutmeg and orange zest, it’s divine.</p>
<h2>CARROT</h2><p><b>Daily serving: 3 heaped tbsp grated</b></p>
<p class="noindent">I have it on good authority that grated carrot fried in butter is a fine breakfast food, but if that’s a step too far for you to take, they also make a nutritious and virtuous alternative to chips. Cut into thin batons, drizzle with olive oil and roast in the oven with some similarly sliced sweet potato and they are delicious. Low in calories while high in vitamin A and the antioxidant beta-carotene, carrots may help fight cancer too. They also make a good addition to pasta sauce. And if you grate them, they melt into a bolognaise sauce – as well as adding nutrients they’ll stretch your mince meat further. </p>
<h2>AVOCADO</h2><p><b>Daily serving: ½ a pear</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Yes, it’s technically a fruit, but with all that omega-6 monounsaturated fat, anti-inflammatory tannin and very little sugar, it’s a special one. The creamy texture offers a wealth of uses. Go for a traditional guacamole (with minced red onions and lime juice for added points) which can be piled on bacon for breakfast, salad for lunch or just about any meat or fish at dinner. Whizzed up with coconut water, lemon and lime juice and mint, it creates a zingy breakfast smoothie. And, my personal favourite, blend it with cocoa powder and a touch of honey for a decadent, guilt-free chocolate mousse.</p>
