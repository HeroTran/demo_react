<p class="dropcap">There is a taboo subject I want to write about. My desire to address it could be a reaction to the many articles currently in the press that claim those who lead businesses are overpaid, overfed, snouts-in-trough devils. It could also be because when Standard Life and other key Scottish businesses dared to voice a concern that independence would be a bad thing for Scotland, the anti-business feeling was such that the ‘Yes’ vote went up in the polls. Or it could be because I recently asked a group of CFOs and audit chairs how they felt about their interaction with politicians, and they said: “We can’t work with them, so we have to work around them or ignore them.”</p>
<p>Frankly, this is horrifying. Worse, the sheer scale of anti-business sentiment reduces the ability business has to engage with Britons about matters of substance such as investment, employment prospects, geographic growth, and so on. It is fading, if it has not already vanished. </p>
<p>But not all people who run businesses are bad. There are some rogues – but there are rogues in all walks of life. Virtually everyone I have ever met in a senior position in an organisation takes their stewardship role extremely seriously. What’s more, business in the UK provides a tremendous amount to the country: employment, wages, tax, exports, profile and reputation, leadership, investment and more. And business could have a very strong voice when it comes to sustainable economic growth, which we desperately need long-term.</p>
<p>Of course, there would be degrees of self-interest, as there is with any group that speaks to the public – police, regulators, press, politicians, Liverpool fans – but business ultimately wants to create value, which in turn promotes growth and investment and increases employment, wages, tax and so on. There is value in listening when it comes to economic matters. Or when considering whether independence would be good or bad for Scotland.</p>
<p>I have neither the column inches nor the intelligence to explain why public and business engagement has got to this point. When you see major decisions taken by the public at large, and you hear the silence from business before and after that decision, I find myself wishing that it was shouting a bit more loudly and forcing others to listen. And more importantly, that its words were reported in a fair and balanced way.</p>
