<h2>PUB LANDLORDS</h2><p>Struggling pub landlords will be protected by new measures to crack down on beer-tie agreements, where landlords are required to buy beer, often at high prices, from pub companies. Vince Cable said: “Far too many landlords feel their income is squeezed by big pub companies.”</p>
<h2>CAR INSURERS</h2><p>Britain’s motor insurance industry made its first annual profit in 20 years, thanks to a clampdown on fraudulent claims. Insurers paid out £98.50 for every £100 received in premiums last year, according to EY. It is only the second time the motor insurance industry has made a profit since records began in 1985.</p>
<h2>RAMSAY'S NIGHTMARES</h2><p>Accounts published in June showed celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay’s holdings company, Kavalake, made a £6.4m loss last year. He has plans to open a restaurant in Hong Kong this year, but in the UK he’s involved in a dispute over the lease of his London pub, the York &amp; Albany. Following a £2m profit the previous year, most of the loss relates to a provision on that lease. Oh, and £2m in legal fees.</p>
<h2>JERSEY'S REGULATOR</h2><p>The Jersey Financial Services Commission was criticised for failing to act against a firm, nominally owned by a Jersey trust company accused of moving ‘blood gold’. “Authorities do not seem to be moving quickly,” said former UN investigator Kathi Austin.</p>
<h2>BDO</h2><p>Former BDO US vice chairman Charles Bee was sentenced to 16 months in prison for his part in a tax shelter scheme that generated $6.5bn (£3.9bn) in bogus losses. Adrian Dicker, another former vice chairman, also pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 10 months in prison. It was described as the biggest tax shelter fraud in US history.</p>
