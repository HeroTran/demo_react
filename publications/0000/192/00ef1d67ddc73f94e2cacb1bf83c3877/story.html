<p class="dropcap">Last month, Chinese president Xi Jinping hosted a summit for many of the leaders of the 65 countries engaged in his “one belt, one road” (OBOR) initiative, a pioneering programme that will channel billions of investment dollars toward infrastructure projects across Asia, Africa, and Europe.</p>
<p>The main impulse driving the OBOR initiative is physical connectivity: efficient infrastructure enhances productivity, fosters investment, and lowers the costs of trade. With effective channels for the exchange of goods and well connected information networks, growth accelerates, economic opportunity increases, and inequality narrows.</p>
<p>Infrastructure can be built in an efficient and cost-effective manner,  the key is co-operative efforts that exploit each country’s respective comparative advantage, be it capital, technological know-how, logistical or construction capabilities, raw materials, or even industrial goods. This can jumpstart development in low-income countries and help emerging economies bypass the dreaded middle-income trap.</p>
<p>But making physical connectivity work requires massive amounts of funding, policy co-ordination and regulatory harmonisation. In the short term, infrastructure investment can be impeded by significant political, sovereign and financial risks.</p>
<p>There is a risk that political leaders will prioritise short-term interests above any long-term vision. They may try to win votes with reductions in road tolls or water tariffs, causing otherwise good infrastructure projects to produce net losses. They may also lack motivation to raise funds for big projects unless those efforts translate into actual votes.</p>
<p>It doesn’t help that many countries are also grappling with public debt, which makes it difficult for them to borrow from multilateral development institutions. With limited fiscal space, governments might resort to levying taxes to pursue infrastructure investment. They might also have to reduce investment in other critical areas, such as education, health, or the environment.</p>
<p>China recognises the urgency with which developing countries need investment in roads, railroads, power plants and grids, airports, and seaports, as well as the challenges of securing them. And it is well aware of the potential benefits of connectivity, particularly if it extends beyond the Asia-Pacific region.</p>
<p>Since introducing the OBOR initiative, China has been accused of attempting to wrest greater control over the developing world, and even to replace the US as the dominant global superpower. But China may be the best-equipped country for the job. In the US, a major infrastructure upgrade is long overdue, with politics, among other factors, often impeding progress. By contrast, China has, in the words of Jeffrey D. Sachs, “proved itself highly effective at building large and complex infrastructure” that “complements industrial capital” and has “attracted foreign private-sector capital and technology”.</p>
<p>Of course, China may be accused of advancing its own agenda for any action it takes abroad. It could have been more effective in making the economic case for physical connectivity. And Chinese companies could have taken more care to understand and appreciate local customs and cultures, thereby avoiding tensions with local people, as well as to ensure environmental sustainability.</p>
<p>But these lapses are fixable and are being addressed, both by Xi’s administration and Chinese companies investing overseas. The bigger challenge lies in creating a designated institution to co-ordinate the many OBOR initiatives. On this front, success will be possible only if countries avoid allowing politics to cloud their judgement. There is no defence for rejecting an economically sensible global initiative just because China is the one leading it.</p>
