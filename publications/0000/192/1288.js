The heaviest single cargo ever to be lifted in the history of the oil and gas industry, it arrived on the Pioneering Spirit transporter ship from the Shell-owned Brent oilfield, 115 miles north-east of Scotland. Tugboats then towed the 24,000-tonne platform on a barge up the River Tees to the Able UK yard. The Brent Delta was one of the first platforms to be built in the early days of Britain’s oil and gas industry.</p>\n<h2 class=\"noindent\"><b>WARREN BUFFETT: DO NOT IGNORE WHISTLEBLOWERS</b></h2><p class=\"noindent\">At the Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting in May, Warren Buffett said ignoring whistleblowing was a “huge error” that led to the accounts scandal at Wells Fargo, one of his largest investments. More than 5,000 salespeople set up around 2 million fake accounts to meet high-pressure internal goals but the bank dismissed warnings about the fraudulent accounts from employees who had called its ethics hotline between 2011 and 2016. Buffett said: “At some point if there’s a major problem, the CEO gets wind of it. And the CEO has to act.”</p>\n<h2 class=\"noindent\"><b>PARIS CLIMATE ACCORD: WHAT NEXT?</b></h2><p class=\"noindent\">As senior government officials from almost 200 nations met in Bonn to work on detailed rules for the Paris Agreement, 214 institutional investors with more than $15trn of assets under management urged governments to implement the climate accord. Following US threats to pull out, California Public Employees Retirement System and other pension funds from Sweden to Australia said “mitigation of climate change is essential for the safeguarding of our investments”. On 28 July, Al Gore’s An Inconvenient Sequel: Truth to Power is released in the US.</p>\n<h2 class=\"noindent\"><b>INNOVATE FINANCE HAS A NEW CHAIR</b></h2><p class=\"noindent\">As Sky News revealed, ex-Financial Ombudsman Service boss Natalie Ceeney will be the new chair at Innovate Finance. The not-for-profit organisation set up in 2014 to promote the fintech sector, which lists Deloitte among its members, aims to maintain its position as “a single point of access to help create a global financial services sector that is more sustainable, more inclusive and better for everyone”. Not a simple task when you have EU negotiator Guy Verhofstadt making noise about the rights of EU citizens in the UK and vice versa.</p>\n<h2 class=\"noindent\"><b>CHINESE GROWTH</b></h2><p class=\"noindent\">As reported in the FT, Geely, the Chinese industrial group that owns Swedish carmaker Volvo Cars, has moved into international financial services by agreeing to buy almost a third of Saxo Bank, one of Denmark’s biggest. Geely will acquire about 30% of the bank from co-founder and former chief executive Lars Christensen, as well as other investors. “It is simply a way to establish a presence in a segment that they think is going to grow fast, both in Europe and China,” a person familiar with the deal said. It was reported in March that Volvo Cars hopes to raise about $500m from Chinese investors as it prepares for a possible stock market listing.</p>\n<h2 class=\"noindent\"><b>PWC HIRES AL BOSS</b></h2><p class=\"noindent\">PwC has appointed Euan Cameron to the newly created role of UK artificial intelligence leader. Cameron said: “Different industries are adopting robotic process automation (RPA) and AI at varying rates but with the field developing so rapidly, those who wait could miss out on the myriad positive opportunities it will bring.” Jon Andrews, head of technology and investments at PwC added: “Technology is essential to the success of our firm and we now employ over 1,500 technology specialists in the UK alone. Our ambition is that we’ll continue to grow our revenues from technology-related areas – including AI, cyber security, data analytics and fintech.”</p>\n<h2 class=\"noindent\"><b>£70M</b></h2><p class=\"noindent\">According to The Telegraph newspaper, television presenter Noel Edmonds is seeking £70m in compensation from Lloyds Banking Group relating to the HBOS fraud scandal. Edmonds argues that HBOS and its former employee, Mark Dobson, were behind the collapse of his business Unique Group 10 years ago. In a letter to the Lloyds chief executive, António Horta-Osório, his lawyers allege that he “suffered immense economic loss” and “distress and inconvenience” at the hands of the Reading branch of HBOS.</p>\n<h2 class=\"noindent\"><b>HOLDING OUT FOR A HERO</b></h2><p class=\"noindent\">Superhero movies are everywhere, and they’re box office gold. According to Fortune, Disney and Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 brought in $145m in one weekend when it opened at 4,347 locations domestically. And in major foreign markets including Korea, Russia and China, its weekend total was around $269m. In the next year there’s also Wonder Woman, Spider-Man: Homecoming, Thor: Ragnarok, Justice League, Deadpool 2, Black Panther, Bloodshot and Avengers: Infinity War.

Taxpayers were required to rescue failing mega banks. This implicit nationalisation is particularly unfortunate since it supports privatising profits and socialising losses.</p>\n<p>“Nationalisation may indeed put pressure on the culture of extreme performance bonuses in the financial sector since the justifying argument of facing the risk of failure will not be available.</p>\n<p>“However, another severe problem would arise. The banking sector would become even more uniform, populated by only one type, the nationalised (mega) bank. </p>\n<p>“Usually diversity increases a system’s probability of successfully absorbing shocks and of being independently able to return to a steady state. Will a system consisting of just a few national mega banks perform better than a system in which many bank types – be they private or public, large or small, primarily wholesale funded or deposit-funded, locally oriented or internationally active – share the market?</p>\n<p>“If the diversity paradigm – known from ecological systems – holds, many bank types sharing the market may increase resilience and, thus, may rule out nationalisation of all banks as the preferable option.” </p>\n<h2 class=\"noindent\"><b>ANNA BLIGH, head of the Australian Bankers’ Association</b></h2><p class=\"noindent\">“Banks in Australia are under an unprecedented level of pressure and scrutiny. There is a direct correlation between the implosion of trust and the explosion of scrutiny.</p>\n<p>“Banks understand they are swimming against the tide of powerful global forces that can be extremely dispiriting.</p>\n<p>“But none of us can afford to give up on the goal of our banks winning back the trust of their customers and the public because that trust is integral to the banks and to all sectors in the new environment in which we all operate.”</p>\n<h2 class=\"noindent\"><b>CHRISTOS TRIANTOPOULOS, research fellow, Centre of Planning and Economic Research (KEPE) in Athens</b></h2><p class=\"noindent\">“The nationalisation of banks is like a two-edged sword. On the one side, the state as an entrepreneur has been proved inefficient, especially regarding the allocation of resources through the banking system. State ownership and intervention contributes to the macroeconomic deterioration by fuelling fiscal expansion and ‘breaking’ the monetary transmission channels.</p>\n<p>“On the other side, financial liberalisation may easily lead to a condition of financial euphoria that cannot be adequately followed by the state. In such an environment the ‘toxic’ dimension of a sophisticated and over-leveraged financial system may grow, creating the field for a financial crisis.</p>\n<p>“The state, along with its independent agencies, must hold a regulatory and supervisory role, holding – in theory – the card of (temporary) nationalisation of banks only for times of strong financial turmoil.</p>\n<p>“The best way to solve this difficult equation is through the establishment of a framework that includes banking regulation, supervision, bail (in and out), resolution, and deposits guarantee, without the state’s direct involvement.”</p>\n<h2 class=\"noindent\"><b>CHARAN SINGH, RBI chair professor of economics at the Indian Institute of Management</b></h2><p class=\"noindent\">“The era of social banking is over; inefficient government banks should be sold off. The question is how to go about doing it. Given that taxpayers’ money is at stake, there is a need to establish very high standards; or else privatisation should be an alternative”</p>\n<h2 class=\"noindent\"><b>LOUIS-PHILIPPE ROCHON, professor of economics at Laurentian University, Canada</b></h2><p class=\"noindent\">“Many have argued that banks were responsible for the financial crisis and, as such, deep reforms are needed, even raising the possibility of nationalising the banking system. This analysis is at best naïve.</p>\n<p>“There is no doubt banks behaved badly, and broke the public trust by behaving in a way that threatened the stability of the economic system.</p>\n<p>“But while it is true that there have been abuses, the solution is not to nationalise the banking system. I am not opposed to having one public bank, while also ensuring that banks fulfill their important role as purveyors of credit. </p>\n<p>“After all, the banking system was very much well behaved under the Glass-Steagall Act, for instance. We must therefore aim to reinstall many of the regulations, such as distinct separation between commercial and investment banking, strict rules on financial derivatives, to name a few.” </p>\n<h2 class=\"noindent\"><b>MATT STOLLER, fellow at the Open Markets Program at New America, on Twitter</b></h2><p class=\"noindent\">“I don’t think nationalisation is a good model here. RBS should be broken up into lots of smaller banks.”</p>\n<h2 class=\"noindent\"><b>PHILIP BOOTH, senior academic fellow at the Institute of Economic Affairs, UK</b></h2><p class=\"noindent\">“The idea that banks are too important to be left to the market is an illogical one. The most important things in life, such as food, housing and clothing are provided by markets. Is there something specific about banks that should lead them to be nationalised? The answer is ‘no’.</p>\n<p>“Banks give rise to systemic risk – if one falls, all banks might be endangered. But there are methods of dealing with this. The most important is a mechanism for ensuring that banks can be wound up safely. The provision of such a legal framework is the most important responsibility of the state when it comes to banks.</p>\n<p>“The semi-nationalised mortgage securitisation warehouses in the US were a disaster. The Slovenian banking system – more or less fully nationalised – suffered every bit as much as any other system during the crisis. And this is not surprising. When people take risks with other people’s money, they are not likely to be careful.</p>\n<p>“There is a long history of nationalised banks losing money. The key to a stable system is to ensure that private banks do not have access to taxpayers’ money through bailouts and to ensure that banks can be wound up safely.”</p>\n<h2 class=\"noindent\"><b>GUILLAUME VALLET, associate professor of economics at Université de Grenoble-Alpes, France</b></h2><p class=\"noindent\">“It’s not possible to consider banks only as private institutions, and even to talk solely about nationalisation as a solution. We should think about the following questions reaching a conclusion:</p>\n<p class=\"noindent\">“<b>1.</b> Does a monetary ecosystem function better when there is only one kind of actor?</p>\n<p class=\"noindent\"><b>2.</b> Does the nature of ownership matter when channeling credit?</p>\n<p class=\"noindent\"><b>3.</b> Is there a distinction between the ownership of money and its uses?</p>\n<p class=\"noindent\"><b>4.</b> Who should be in charge regarding the expertise and distribution of banking resources?</p>\n<p class=\"noindent\"><b>5.</b> How do we deal with the asymmetry of information?</p>\n<p class=\"noindent\"><b>6.</b> Do market incentives matter in the allowance of banking resources?</p>\n<p class=\"noindent\"><b>7.</b> Is it possible to nationalise banks without nationalising companies that need access to money?</p>\n<p class=\"noindent\"><b>8.</b> How do we provide the best answer to future global economic challenges?</p>\n<p class=\"noindent\"><b>9.</b> What ethical angle should be considered?</p>\n<p class=\"noindent\"><b>10.</b> How can we improve banks’ accountability towards society as a whole?</p>\n<p class=\"noindent\">“Answers to these questions should make clear that there exists an important difference between nationalisation and increased state regulations in the banking system.”</p>\n","layout":{"landscape":{"id":"am-dp1-layout1","link":"story-landscape-layout1.html"},"portrait":{"id":"am-dp1-layout2","link":"story-portrait-layout1.html"}},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":"","link_source":"","image":[{"id":"66f6440d1ff8b1e50c5d32e48dc2a452","name":"Debate","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com/var/economia/storage/images/debate37/124266-1-eng-GB/debate_story_img_size_708x430.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"708","height":"430","is_default":true},{"id":"66f6440d1ff8b1e50c5d32e48dc2a452","name":"Debate","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com/var/economia/storage/images/debate37/124266-1-eng-GB/debate_story_img_size_472x478.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"472","height":"478","is_default":false}],"related_objects":{"gallery":[[{"id":"5521eb510b632dbb17cc12dc2a7636e7","name":"Philip

I didn’t want to carry on the chemistry road, and I got a job at PwC in Cambridge. They worked with a lot of biotechs at the time – I thought I could use my chemistry knowledge, to some degree, with their clients.</p>\n<p>In what appears to be a recurring theme of my career, about two and a half years after qualifying I felt I needed a new challenge. I moved to transaction services and was incredibly lucky that I began working in the mid-market team across lots of different industries, and I loved that. It gave me the chance to get to know different industries and what made them tick.</p>\n<p>I was working on a vendor assistance piece for Griffin Global and started to hone in on the travel industry because of the jobs I’d been working on. Griffin offered me a job, and it was at the time that I wanted to take ownership of what I was doing. I would write a report saying “have you thought about X, Y or Z?”, but didn’t get to put it into practice. So the offer was perfect timing.</p>\n<p>I’ve always liked challenges. The prospect of working across different countries and cultures really floated my boat. It was amazing to see the other side of the table. You’re a little bit blinkered in practice and don’t necessarily prioritise things that are important to your clients. I encourage people to take secondments in industry, even if it’s only for a short time, to be able to get that perspective.</p>\n<p>Working at Griffin was incredibly challenging. For example, we didn’t really have our own offering in Norway. I ended up setting up an office from scratch, and we came out of the two joint ventures we had there.</p>\n<p>The key is understanding the people you’re working with, knowing what motivates them and what makes them tick. It’s important to have the right people – people that have the values of the company you’re in. Clear communication of what is expected is crucial. I don’t like to beat around the bush. It is important to have open relationships and no hierarchy. Just empower the team so they can work more efficiently.</p>\n<p>This attitude runs across the company at PKF Cooper Parry (CP). You know when you walk in the door if you’ll fit. I immediately felt that here. </p>\n<p>I never envisaged going back into practice – although I’m on the internal operations side now. It is a company like no other.</p>\n<p>I’ve been incredibly lucky: the reason I moved on from Griffin Global was that I had my first child. I knew that the travel wasn’t going to work. When I came back to work I was lucky to find CP. It offers the challenges I need. It’s a place where I can make a difference. But it also offers a work/life balance. Six months ago I had my second child so it’s been a busy time.</p>\n<p>Thankfully, there isn’t a normal day at CP.</p>\n<p>My new role involves working with team heads, to look at how I can support them to achieve their individual vision. We have a very clear firm vision, and then each department will have their own. Growth is a big part of this. When I started, in November 2014, we had fewer than 250 people – we’re now at 420. At this time we just had the East Midlands office, now we’ve got the West Midlands office too. We came together with Clement Keys in January last year.</p>\n<p>We had to bring two cultures together. At CP we purposely set out to disrupt, to set ourselves apart and to be bold and entrepreneurial. Taking that to another culture and accountancy firm is a big shift.</p>\n<p>As you get bigger the most important thing is to remain agile. This all comes down to the lack of hierarchy and empowering people to make decisions. My key role now is to make sure we are scaleable. That comes with challenges. You don’t want to put processes in place that straightjacket people. I’m passionate about removing noise, so any admin tasks that aren’t adding value and frustrate people get removed.</p>\n<p>Within the next three years we want to be up to £45m turnover. We’re doing £30m this year. Within 10 years we want to be doing £150m. We know where we are aiming, we’ve set our targets and so far we are achieving, if not exceeding, them.</p>\n<p>One of the most rewarding things is seeing a team develop.

And the stories they’d tell! I always find that truth is stranger than fiction.</p>\n<p class=\"noindent\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"noindent\"><b>MY FAVOURITE BOOK </b>is Confessions by Jean-Jaques Rousseau. The mix of insight into his mental processes and slice-of-life stories from this unusual phase of European history proved wonderfully addictive.</p>\n<p class=\"noindent\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"noindent\"><b>THE BOOK I LEARNT THE MOST FROM</b> is 1984 by George Orwell. I grew up in the 1960s and 1970s in the American Midwest and believed governments were basically good and society was basically just. This book was the beginning of a lifetime of cynicism.</p>\n<p class=\"noindent\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"noindent\"><b>THE LAST BOOK I READ WAS </b>The Righteous Mind by Jon Haidt. Haidt lays out for the non-specialist the theories and evidence suggesting people often act as individual members of communities, rather than just individuals. This helps explain their seeming predilection for policies that are not in their individual self interest.</p>\n<p class=\"noindent\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"noindent\"><b>MY DESERT ISLAND BOOK WOULD BE </b>Power and Plenty by O’Rourke &amp; Findlay, since this contains a lifetime of information on world history.</p>\n<div class=\"am_info_box\">\n\t<fieldset>\n\t<legend><div>economia reviews...</div></legend>\n\t<div class=\"text\"><p class=\"noindent\"><b>50 Economics Classics by Tom Butler-Bowdon</b></p>\n<p class=\"noindent\">On first glance, this book is an example of what’s wrong with our listicle-driven, social media soundbite society. Reducing great works by brilliant economic minds from across the political spectrum to pithy one-liners might be a clever exercise, but should it be encouraged?</p>\n<p>Spending a little longer with this book (the latest in the 50 Classics series) reveals it as something more. It serves as a useful primer (or refresher, if it’s a while since you studied economics) for these great works. But putting these ideas in close contact with one another allows each one to be reflected in the light of the others. This offers new insights into works by “first generation” economists such as Adam Smith as well as newer writing by Thomas Piketty or Michael Lewis that reflects topical concerns.</p>\n<p>So how might we best summarise this book of summaries? Well, the author does that himself, when he describes it as “an intelligent person’s guide to capitalism, finance and the global economy”.</p>\n</div>\n\t</fieldset>\n</div>","layout":{"landscape":{"id":"am-dp1-layout1","link":"story-landscape-layout1.html"},"portrait":{"id":"am-dp1-layout2","link":"story-portrait-layout1.html"}},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":"","link_source":"","image":[{"id":"ba3a47172d0d21a22525f900c25177b5","name":"Books","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com/var/economia/storage/images/books14/124367-1-eng-GB/books_story_img_size_708x430.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"708","height":"430","is_default":true},{"id":"ba3a47172d0d21a22525f900c25177b5","name":"Books","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com/var/economia/storage/images/books14/124367-1-eng-GB/books_story_img_size_472x478.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"472","height":"478","is_default":false}],"related_objects":{"gallery":[[{"id":"119f15f351aaa6c25d9aee7a4969146a","name":"50 Economics Classics","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com/var/economia/storage/images/50-economics-classics/124379-1-eng-GB/50-economics-classics_default_ipad_portrait.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"641","height":"1024"},{"id":"119f15f351aaa6c25d9aee7a4969146a","name":"50 Economics Classics","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com/var/economia/storage/images/50-economics-classics/124379-1-eng-GB/50-economics-classics_default_ipad_landscape.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"481","height":"768"},{"id":"f0fc66cf22432874d0cb133bb8762946","name":"Confessions","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com/var/economia/storage/images/confessions/124386-1-eng-GB/confessions_default_ipad_portrait.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"675","height":"1024"},{"id":"f0fc66cf22432874d0cb133bb8762946","name":"Confessions","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com/var/economia/storage/images/confessions/124386-1-eng-GB/confessions_default_ipad_landscape.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"506","height":"768"},{"id":"7c3232a14c49df632c7d89258bd78f36","name":"Power and Plenty","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com/var/economia/storage/images/power-and-plenty/124400-1-eng-GB/power-and-plenty_default_ipad_portrait.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"669","height":"1024"},{"id":"7c3232a14c49df632c7d89258bd78f36","name":"Power and Plenty","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com/var/economia/storage/images/power-and-plenty/124400-1-eng-GB/power-and-plenty_default_ipad_landscape.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"502","height":"768"},{"id":"03154bc93e7148e6d2634888c667249f","name":"The Righteous Mind","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com/var/economia/storage/images/the-righteous-mind/124393-1-eng-GB/the-righteous-mind_default_ipad_portrait.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"666","height":"1024"},{"id":"03154bc93e7148e6d2634888c667249f","name":"The Righteous Mind","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com/var/economia/storage/images/the-righteous-mind/124393-1-eng-GB/the-righteous-mind_default_ipad_landscape.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"499","height":"768"}]]},"url_alias":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com","type":"story","order":"10","folio_number":"","folio_numbers":"","pdf_page_index":"0","thumbnail":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com/var/economia/storage/images/books14/124367-1-eng-GB/books_tablet_story_thumbnail.jpg","color":"939598","real_id":"13682","main_section_id":"1288","ads":[]},{"id":"25ea6a82d9248b40935b561096fc6e73","title":"From the top","sub_title":"","author":[{"id":"0","name":"Emily Black","email":"emily.black@progressivecp.com","is_default":false}],"tag":"","strap_line":"From the top","short_intro":"","intro":"ICAEW president Hilary Lindsay looks back on her year in office and weighs up what has been achieved","body":"<p class=\"dropcap\">When I became ICAEW president 12 months ago, I saw my role as helping our institute to pursue its strategy and leave it even stronger by the end of my year. So I am delighted that we are currently implementing our new strategy, which we have developed over the year. Our vision encompasses creating “a world of strong economies”. In other words, we will work – both collectively as an institute and individually as members – with others to create strong, accountable and open economies where people can trust data, leaders can make good decisions, public finances are transparent and businesses are responsible.</p>\n<p>In implementing that strategy, we have identified three cornerstones. The first, future professionals, is about making sure that our current and future members have got the right skills, knowledge and attitude to equip them for the challenges of a career as a chartered accountant.</p>\n<p>I have no doubt from all the students and members that I’ve met throughout my presidential year that ICAEW’s future will be very bright. Similarly, I am confident, from the groups I’ve met, that the second element, connected communities, is also in good hands.</p>\n<p>I’ve seen how much we have to gain by meeting each other, whether face to face or through our virtual communities, and how it contributes to increasing that sense that we all belong to our institute. This is particularly important to me given that one of my two presidential themes was making ICAEW more inclusive.</p>\n<p>With that in mind – and as the first academic to become ICAEW president – I was doubly delighted when we recently launched our academia and education community. Interestingly, more than 3,000 of our members tell us they work in education, over half of whom are women. However, our community is not just for them: we are opening it up for free to anyone interested in ICAEW and profession-related topics.</p>\n<p>The third element of our strategy is about being an agile institute, which again really resonates with my second theme, adaptability. Being agile means making sure that we are able to shape and react to external events quickly and have the resources to make an impact on behalf of our members, the profession and the public interest. All three elements are inextricably bound together and form a link between the Institute’s heritage and its future.</p>\n<p>It has been an amazing privilege to have been your president. I’d like to say thank you to my fellow volunteers, to our amazing staff and to all our members. You’ve made me so proud of ICAEW and I am delighted now to be passing the baton to incoming president Nick Parker who, I am sure, will also have a rewarding and successful year.</p>\n<div class=\"am_info_box\">\n\t<fieldset>\n\t<legend><div>ICAEW EVENTS</div></legend>\n\t<div class=\"text\"><p class=\"noindent text-left\"><b>7 JUNE</b></p>\n<p class=\"noindent text-left\"><b>WORKING OVERSEAS: HOW TO MAKE THE DREAM A REALITY</b></p>\n<p class=\"noindent text-left\">This event will look at the practicalities and realities of working overseas, from how to get started to the effect working in different countries can have on your wallet and social life.

But the apparent downgrading of the DG role is tantamount to a U-turn.</p>\n<p>“I still maintain government needs a CFO at the top table,” Izza says. “The task facing the incoming chancellor when it comes to balancing the books will be enormous. Having a qualified accountant with strong financial leadership skills at the top would help government instil financial disciplines across Whitehall, provide strategic advice to policymakers on key financial policy decisions, strengthen standards, improve balance sheet management and drive value for money across government.”</p>\n<h2 class=\"noindent\"><b>A MANIFESTO FOR SMALL BUSINESS</b></h2><p class=\"noindent\">Small businesses are best placed to build an economy that works for everyone around the UK, says the Small Business Taskforce, but they cannot do it without the support of the incoming government.</p>\n<p>In its manifesto for small business, the taskforce – which comprises 14 organisations, including ICAEW and Enterprise Nation, and represents over two million small businesses – has come up with six key recommendations “to build a positive and progressive business case for Britain”.</p>\n<p>The new government needs to recognise the positive and powerful role small businesses play in the UK and appoint a small business minister to champion their interests. It must provide a taxation system that encourages business investment and growth through stability, is simple to understand and administer, and puts the needs of business first when it comes to making tax digital.</p>\n<p>The business support it provides must be collaborative and add value. Suggestions include championing public/private partnerships in business support, launching export vouchers, reinstatement of the Spaces for Growth programme, and establishing a single site for all engagement between government and SMEs.</p>\n<p>The taskforce also wants the government to provide a pensions and benefits system that supports when needed, procurement opportunities that work for all, and last, but by no means least, a workforce that is equipped for enterprise. </p>\n<h2 class=\"noindent\"><b>BUSINESS OPTIMISM INCREASING</b></h2><p class=\"noindent\">Confidence among UK businesses has increased for the first time in a year but they remain reluctant to make long-term growth plans, according to ICAEW’s latest Business Confidence Monitor (BCM).</p>\n<p>In the second quarter of the year, business optimism moved into positive territory to 6.7 from -8.7 in Q1. This increase was boosted by the finance and business, utility and manufacturing sectors, which all showed a more positive outlook. Both retail and wholesale remain in negative territory though. This is not surprising, says ICAEW. Given that businesses are expected to pass a portion of rising input costs on to consumers, the largest confidence rises were always likely to rest with those companies that sit further away from direct contact with consumers.</p>\n<p>This trend will continue for the rest of 2017, it predicts, because household incomes look set to be squeezed further in coming months. The problem stems from input prices, which have been rising at more than double the pace of last year. As a result, businesses have been trying to control costs by capping wage growth to below inflation. But the announcement of the general election as well as the upcoming Brexit negotiations has also led to businesses putting recruitment and wage growth on hold.</p>\n<h2 class=\"noindent\"><b>COMPUTER-BASED STARS</b></h2><p class=\"noindent\">Not content with coming top in just one of their professional level exams, two candidates have been placed first in two papers each. Heather Brown, training with PwC in St Albans, took first place and the Railton prize in business strategy and first place and the Howitt prize in financial management. Her achievement was matched by that of Harriet Baker, a trainee with Deutsche Bank in Ingatestone, who came top in audit and assurance and financial accounting and reporting, winning the Watts and Spicer Pegler prizes as well.</p>\n<p>Two other PwC trainees took the remaining prizes. Haaris Hayat from Barking came top in tax compliance and won the Knox prize, and Daniel Orchard from Harrow came top in business planning: taxation and won the Little prize.</p>\n<p>ICAEW was also celebrating the successful launch of its first ever computer-based exams in audit and assurance and tax compliance. Learning and professional development executive director Mark Protherough said the results were comparable to students who had previously taken the same exam on paper. </p>\n","layout":{"landscape":{"id":"am-dp1-layout1","link":"story-landscape-layout1.html"},"portrait":{"id":"am-dp1-layout2","link":"story-portrait-layout1.html"}},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":"","link_source":"","image":[{"id":"8276ce684f9f6be7274002846eab7845","name":"Moorgate-News-NEW","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com/var/economia/storage/images/moorgate-news-new3/124450-1-eng-GB/moorgate-news-new_story_img_size_708x430.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"708","height":"430","is_default":true},{"id":"8276ce684f9f6be7274002846eab7845","name":"Moorgate-News-NEW","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com/var/economia/storage/images/moorgate-news-new3/124450-1-eng-GB/moorgate-news-new_story_img_size_472x478.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"472","height":"478","is_default":false}],"url_alias":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com","type":"story","order":"12","folio_number":"","folio_numbers":"","pdf_page_index":"0","thumbnail":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com/var/economia/storage/images/moorgate-news-new3/124450-1-eng-GB/moorgate-news-new_tablet_story_thumbnail.jpg","color":"939598","real_id":"13693","main_section_id":"1288","ads":[]}],"type":null,"ads":[]}}
