I have been getting that sense of déjà vu a lot recently, brought on by another push in the media to look at whether or not the audit profession is meeting the expectations of its stakeholders.</p>\n<p>Not that I am complaining. There has always been a gap between the profession’s understanding of the scope and remit of audit and that of the wider public, and even some users of audit reports. Interest in this expectation gap I regard as a sign that people still see the audit as relevant. But I did think we might get a longer breather following the implementation of the latest audit reforms.</p>\n<p>It is, after all, only three years since the Competition and Markets Authority carried out its investigation into the statutory audit services market. This in turn fed into the EU’s Audit Regulation and Directive, which celebrates the first anniversary of its implementation this month. A year is hardly enough time for the changes to be embedded and nowhere near enough time for their effectiveness in bolstering audit independence to be assessed. However, there is agreement that mandatory audit tendering and rotation are turning out to be good for the profession.</p>\n<p>In the Financial Times in April, Sir Ewan Brown, a non-executive director of Stagecoach and former Lloyds TSB audit committee chairman, kicked things off again with a call to scrap mandatory independent audits in favour of what he called “the best defence against malfeasance” – rigorous internal controls.</p>\n<p>A strong internal audit, he wrote, can provide assurances to the audit committee and senior management on the effectiveness of governance and risk processes. He also suggested that questions need to be answered about auditors’ competence in the light of some banks’ criminal behaviour since the financial crisis. Much of this illegal activity was uncovered not through audit, but through whistleblowing or investigative journalism. What, he asked, were the auditors doing while all this was going on? He concludes that audit should go and the com–pany’s directors be made responsible for the accuracy of disclosures.</p>\n<p>Not surprisingly, his article attracted some spirited defence of audit as well as a few letters of support. Taken at face value, his call to scrap the audit is unlikely to gain much ground: whenever this question has cropped up in the past, investors and other audit users, as well as legislators and regulators, have resoundingly rejected the idea. Personally, I interpret Sir Ewan’s letter as a slightly tongue-in-cheek challenge not just to auditors but to all the other parts of the wider audit process – audit committees, internal auditors, directors – to up their game, something we are always keen to do.</p>\n<p>Of course, I am bound to point out that audit failures are few and far between, and while it’s easy to point out audit shortcomings, it can be more difficult to talk about successes. Many of them are not publicly visible, despite moves over the past few years towards greater transparency in the audit process and a more open relationship between the auditor and audit committee. But I do feel that we are potentially on the cusp of being able to redefine and therefore repurpose the audit if everyone involved is willing to take this step together.</p>\n<p>This step will be based on the increasing use of technology and in particular data analytics to help auditors express their opinion on the financial statements.</p>\n<p>Moving from sampling to whole population extraction and then exception review could be a game changer in terms of uncovering fraud, but it also could allow auditors to move beyond the financial statements and give assurance to other non-financial measures that, certainly in the public interest entity (PIE) market, are important and in some cases more important than historic financial statements.</p>\n<p>This widening of the scope of the audit would, assuming auditors, audit committees and management agree, allow auditors to look at areas currently off limits. This would give the audit profession the opportunity to tackle the expectation gap that stubbornly refuses to go away. But this has to be done in a way that leaves auditors with suitable liability protection and makes the profession, particularly in the PIE market, of interest to a wider group of firms.</p>\n<p>We’ve been talking about these issues for decades. Are we going to have the impetus today and the resolve to do something about it?</p>\n<p class=\"callaction\">Michael Izza, ICAEW chief executive</p>\n","layout":{"landscape":{"id":"am-dp1-layout31","link":"story-landscape-layout16.html"},"portrait":{"id":"am-dp1-layout32","link":"story-portrait-layout16.html"}},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":"","link_source":"","image":[{"id":"3c61b00e58b1d534bcd5f97462b94b1d","name":"Michael Izza","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com/var/economia/storage/images/michael-izza55/124475-1-eng-GB/michael-izza_story_img_size_190x132.png","portrait":true,"width":"190","height":"132","is_default":true},{"id":"3c61b00e58b1d534bcd5f97462b94b1d","name":"Michael Izza","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com/var/economia/storage/images/michael-izza55/124475-1-eng-GB/michael-izza_story_img_size_259x180.png","portrait":false,"width":"259","height":"180","is_default":false}],"url_alias":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com","type":"story","order":"13","folio_number":"","folio_numbers":"","pdf_page_index":"0","thumbnail":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com/var/economia/storage/images/michael-izza55/124475-1-eng-GB/michael-izza_tablet_story_thumbnail.png","color":"0092b0","real_id":"13696","main_section_id":"1289","ads":[]},{"id":"00ef1d67ddc73f94e2cacb1bf83c3877","title":"Nearly 70 countries and international organisations have signed up for China’s One Belt, One Road initiative, president Xi Jinping’s mega infrastructure project.

With effective channels for the exchange of goods and well connected information networks, growth accelerates, economic opportunity increases, and inequality narrows.</p>\n<p>Infrastructure can be built in an efficient and cost-effective manner,  the key is co-operative efforts that exploit each country’s respective comparative advantage, be it capital, technological know-how, logistical or construction capabilities, raw materials, or even industrial goods. This can jumpstart development in low-income countries and help emerging economies bypass the dreaded middle-income trap.</p>\n<p>But making physical connectivity work requires massive amounts of funding, policy co-ordination and regulatory harmonisation. In the short term, infrastructure investment can be impeded by significant political, sovereign and financial risks.</p>\n<p>There is a risk that political leaders will prioritise short-term interests above any long-term vision. They may try to win votes with reductions in road tolls or water tariffs, causing otherwise good infrastructure projects to produce net losses. They may also lack motivation to raise funds for big projects unless those efforts translate into actual votes.</p>\n<p>It doesn’t help that many countries are also grappling with public debt, which makes it difficult for them to borrow from multilateral development institutions. With limited fiscal space, governments might resort to levying taxes to pursue infrastructure investment. They might also have to reduce investment in other critical areas, such as education, health, or the environment.</p>\n<p>China recognises the urgency with which developing countries need investment in roads, railroads, power plants and grids, airports, and seaports, as well as the challenges of securing them. And it is well aware of the potential benefits of connectivity, particularly if it extends beyond the Asia-Pacific region.</p>\n<p>Since introducing the OBOR initiative, China has been accused of attempting to wrest greater control over the developing world, and even to replace the US as the dominant global superpower. But China may be the best-equipped country for the job. In the US, a major infrastructure upgrade is long overdue, with politics, among other factors, often impeding progress. By contrast, China has, in the words of Jeffrey D. Sachs, “proved itself highly effective at building large and complex infrastructure” that “complements industrial capital” and has “attracted foreign private-sector capital and technology”.</p>\n<p>Of course, China may be accused of advancing its own agenda for any action it takes abroad. It could have been more effective in making the economic case for physical connectivity. And Chinese companies could have taken more care to understand and appreciate local customs and cultures, thereby avoiding tensions with local people, as well as to ensure environmental sustainability.</p>\n<p>But these lapses are fixable and are being addressed, both by Xi’s administration and Chinese companies investing overseas. The bigger challenge lies in creating a designated institution to co-ordinate the many OBOR initiatives. On this front, success will be possible only if countries avoid allowing politics to cloud their judgement. There is no defence for rejecting an economically sensible global initiative just because China is the one leading it.</p>\n<p class=\"callaction\">Keyu Jin, a professor of economics at the London School of Economics, is a World Economic Forum Young Global Leader and a member of the Richemont Group Advisory Board</p>\n<p class=\"callaction\">Copyright: Project Syndicate, 2017.project-syndicate.org</p>\n","layout":{"landscape":{"id":"am-dp1-layout31","link":"story-landscape-layout16.html"},"portrait":{"id":"am-dp1-layout32","link":"story-portrait-layout16.html"}},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":"","link_source":"","image":[{"id":"5054a87a6fb435cd410a6226766fd689","name":"Keyu Jin","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com/var/economia/storage/images/keyu-jin2/124500-1-eng-GB/keyu-jin_story_img_size_190x132.png","portrait":true,"width":"190","height":"132","is_default":true},{"id":"5054a87a6fb435cd410a6226766fd689","name":"Keyu Jin","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com/var/economia/storage/images/keyu-jin2/124500-1-eng-GB/keyu-jin_story_img_size_259x180.png","portrait":false,"width":"259","height":"180","is_default":false}],"url_alias":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com","type":"story","order":"14","folio_number":"","folio_numbers":"","pdf_page_index":"0","thumbnail":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com/var/economia/storage/images/keyu-jin2/124500-1-eng-GB/keyu-jin_tablet_story_thumbnail.png","color":"0092b0","real_id":"13699","main_section_id":"1289","ads":[]},{"id":"a7c94443b88070737f76d05d39797f1f","title":"Emmanuel Macron campaigned – and won – on his claim to be able to break down the rigidities of France’s economy and bring back jobs and growth, but if he fails, the backlash will be bitter","sub_title":"","author":[{"id":"0","name":"Emily Black","email":"emily.black@progressivecp.com","is_default":false}],"tag":"","strap_line":"Bronwen Maddox","short_intro":"","intro":"","body":"<p class=\"dropcap\">For all the headiness about being the youngest president in French history, Emmanuel Macron was right to sound sombre in his first address. He will not know until June’s parliamentary election whether those who support his ideas will win a majority. If they do, it is far from clear that, as an independent as well as a centrist, he has the public support for the reforms he wants to make.</p>\n<p>The presidential campaign, particularly the second round when Macron was pitched against Marine Le Pen, was inevitably dominated by themes of migration and the threat of terrorism. But social reforms and the economy will rear up immediately. The risk for Macron is that, like his predecessor François Hollande, he will fail to make the changes on curbing public spending, bringing down unemployment and boosting growth that he says he intends to achieve.</p>\n<p>France’s economy is at the moment growing steadily – and yet the sources of potential long term crisis are clear. Since the 2008 crisis, the economy has expanded by about 10% after allowing for inflation, and last year reached 1.1%. Yet growth has been slower than in the UK, Germany or the US, and even last year was below the European average of 1.8%. In the first three months of 2017, GDP was just 0.3% higher than in the final quarter of 2016.</p>\n<p>But more than growth, it is unemployment that has plagued politicians. After the crisis, it jumped from more than 7% to more than 9%, and despite the best efforts of Hollande, climbed above 10% and stayed there.</p>\n<p>Macron may now benefit from the steps Hollande took: tax credits to reduce the cost of employing people, new training initiatives, and most controversially, making hiring and firing easier.</p>\n<p>Yet even if the training measures (in particular) begin to chip away at the headline figure, there is little sign Hollande did enough to change the deep, long-term problems. Like Japan, France’s labour market is divided starkly into two: those in full employment with a rich panoply of rights and protections, and those on contracts who lack such assurance. Even though employers are hiring more, they are preferring to do so through short-term contracts, giving the young employed few ways to break into long-term jobs.</p>\n<p>Macron may benefit, too, from Hollande’s most dramatic U-turn: grudgingly agreeing late in his tenure to try to trim back public spending and raise taxes, with a view to improving the stubborn deficits and debt. Macron has made clear he has little time for, as he sees it, the unnecessarily heavy commitments and taxation of the French state. Yet as in other mature economies with ageing populations, France is seeing the bills for health and pensions rising steadily; its public spending amounts to an eye watering 57% of GDP, one of the highest levels among industrialised countries.</p>\n<p>Again, Hollande made some slight progress in the later part of his tenure, although it did nothing to improve his popularity. It is no easy task to take the job further as Macron has vowed to do. A recent European Commission report argued for cutting public spending and easing taxes on business – but neither are popular to say the least.</p>\n<p>Macron is, in the eyes of many outside France and including many in Brussels, advocating the measures that the economy needs. Indeed, Hollande seemed converted to such ideas late in the day. But Macron may be arguing for something that the French public does not yet want to embrace – and recent growth may even weaken support.</p>\n<p>If Macron fails to make such changes, he would hardly be the first. But the consequences might be worse than they were for the Hollande years. Those have produced a centrist radical, mainly famed for being the largely unknown founder of a new party – and young. The backlash could be to convince the many people who found Marine Le Pen’s message powerfully attractive to give her ideas another go in five years’ time.</p>\n<p class=\"callaction\">Bronwen Maddox is director of the Institute for Government and a commentator and broadcaster</p>\n","layout":{"landscape":{"id":"am-dp1-layout31","link":"story-landscape-layout16.html"},"portrait":{"id":"am-dp1-layout32","link":"story-portrait-layout16.html"}},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":"","link_source":"","image":[{"id":"feec93049ce984c2d50ec4c61253c16e","name":"Bronwen Maddox","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com/var/economia/storage/images/bronwen-maddox21/124525-1-eng-GB/bronwen-maddox_story_img_size_190x132.png","portrait":true,"width":"190","height":"132","is_default":true},{"id":"feec93049ce984c2d50ec4c61253c16e","name":"Bronwen Maddox","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com/var/economia/storage/images/bronwen-maddox21/124525-1-eng-GB/bronwen-maddox_story_img_size_259x180.png","portrait":false,"width":"259","height":"180","is_default":false}],"url_alias":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com","type":"story","order":"15","folio_number":"","folio_numbers":"","pdf_page_index":"0","thumbnail":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com/var/economia/storage/images/bronwen-maddox21/124525-1-eng-GB/bronwen-maddox_tablet_story_thumbnail.png","color":"0092b0","real_id":"13702","main_section_id":"1289","ads":[]},{"id":"20dd5b41c1a066d56bbadac4bd1c6703","title":"The old certainties of leadership have been superceded in an age of mass communication and education, and leaders must seek to wield influence rather than impose authority","sub_title":"","author":[{"id":"0","name":"Emily Black","email":"emily.black@progressivecp.com","is_default":false}],"tag":"","strap_line":"Jo Owen","short_intro":"","intro":"","body":"<p class=\"dropcap\">It is the normal conceit of every age to think that it is special, and that life is tough. For leaders, the conceit may be true: life really is getting harder. The main suspect is technology. Whereas in the past leaders could leave work behind in the office, today they are meant to be on 24/7. Many leaders wear their ball and chain of internet and email with pride: they like to show they can stay on top of things all the time. This does not show leadership: it shows insecure control freakiness.</p>\n<p>Leadership has never really been about technology. Leaders from Caesar to Napoleon and Churchill did passably well without ever sending an email. Leadership has always been about people. It is people, not technology that is making leadership harder.</p>\n<p>A brief, revisionist, history of leadership will show why it is becoming so much harder to lead today.</p>\n<p>Business leadership really took off with the Industrial Revolution. In the 19th century, leadership was fairly straightforward. The bosses had the brains and the workers had the hands. The job of the boss was to transmit ideas from their heads into the hands of workers who were treated as unthinking and unreliable machines who were to be coerced or coaxed into working efficiently.</p>\n<p>This was a world of time and motion, of reason and analysis. It was a world for the educated elite, where IQ ruled. This was an agreeable arrangement for the bosses, less agreeable for the workers.</p>\n<p>Then things started to go wrong. Marx had predicted that the workers would eventually rise up against the bosses and owners of capital. He was only half wrong. The workers did something far worse than revolt: they got educated. This meant that they could achieve more, but they also demanded more. Bosses could no longer treat them as unreliable machines. Workers had to be treated as human beings.</p>\n<p>In the course of the 20th century, the education of the workforce proceeded at pace. The more educated people become, the less they seem to like being managed. Anyone who has to manage highly qualified professionals recognises this challenge. Anyone who has seen a university faculty at work knows that they are near to being unmanageable. Eventually, management theory caught up and discovered that IQ is not enough. In addition to being smart, you need emotional intelligence as well, or EQ.</p>\n<p>In the 21st century, things have become even harder. In the past, the art of management was making things happen through people you controlled. Every manager and leader built their empire, and that is what they managed. Today, leaders have to make things happen through people they do not control. That changes everything.</p>\n<p>Standard operating procedure is to find that your responsibilities exceed your resources. As firms delayer and outsource, you have to make things happen through colleagues inside and outside the firm, who may be anywhere in the world. The old certainties of the 20th century seem a long time ago.</p>\n<p>In this new world, leaders need new skills. You have to be able to align agendas, fight for resources, create alliances, build networks of trust and support, and know which battles to fight when. You can no longer make all the decisions, you have to influence decisions and decision making processes. You can no longer command support, you have to build support. You no longer rely on authority, because you never have enough authority: you have to use influence.</p>\n<p>This new set of skills can be described as PQ or Political Quotient. Politics can be a dirty word, but it is vital in a firm. It is how you make things happen, how you exercise power without having formal authority, it is how you make the firm work for you. Inevitably, the most vital skills are the ones that are least taught. Business schools are only emerging slowly from the 19th  century IQ skills set to the 20th century skills set of EQ. No one teaches PQ yet. This is a wonderful opportunity for all emerging leaders: master the skills of PQ and you master your destiny.</p>\n<p class=\"callaction\"><b>Jo Owen is an author, a keynote speaker and the founder of eight NGOs.

In recent years, however, the principle of “paying taxes where profits are made” has failed. Large multinationals have taken advantage of differences in tax systems allowing them to shift profits legally (or less so), erode taxable base and minimise total tax bills. In many cases governments helped them reach a “close-to-zero” effective tax rate.</p>\n<p>The tax revenue from company profit is only 10% of total tax revenue, whereas 24% of total tax revenue comes from citizens (OECD average). This plays a significant role in efforts to reduce those taxes with the most negative effect on economic activity, such as tax on wages.</p>\n<p>The world’s most developed countries asked the OECD for a solution. The result – BEPS (Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) – was presented in 2015 and should soon be implemented.</p>\n<p>Tax policy is a matter of state sovereignty, so coordinated effort in this area is difficult. Yet, despite challenges, the EU has made progress.</p>\n<p>Among the achievements is the OECD BEPS-based Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive (ATAD) and the ATAD II, addressing hybrid mismatches with third countries. The new country-by-country reporting rules (CBCR) for large companies promoted transparency, and may soon become public. International cooperation gained momentum through OECD’s automatic exchange of financial information (AEOI), some countries entered AEOI in 2017 and more will follow next year. I consider this rather successful.</p>\n<p>The biggest challenges are yet to come. The EU’s proposals for consolidating its Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base (CCCTB) are being negotiated by the EU member states’ finance ministers. The reform of the EU VAT regime expected in the autumn will (if approved) end carousel frauds that significantly contribute to the EU VAT gap of nearly €160bn.</p>\n<p>I hope that in the light of recent developments, the member states come to realise the need for such overhaul. The problem with BEPS is clearly a cross-border issue, and joint effort and solutions are the only way towards improvement.</p>\n<p>The Czech Republic saw its tax system as an issue of national sovereignty, but realised recently the need to cooperate across the EU. This puts the country on an equal footing with larger member states, helping to tackle cross-border corporate tax issues and also to voice the concerns of smaller open economies.</p>\n<p>The CCCTB project can help the economy as it can significantly reduce the cost of tax compliance as well as make taxes fairer and easier to collect.</p>\n<p>The Czech Republic also wants to introduce a temporary pilot project that would help minimise VAT carousel frauds before the permanent EU VAT regime is established (no sooner than 2020). Supported by Austria, it called on the Commission to introduce a proposal for temporary derogation that would allow certain member states to introduce a generalised reverse charge mechanism (GRCM).</p>\n<p>I appreciate the determination to fight tax fraud, but I am concerned about the frequent changes to the rules for VAT collection before the long-term EU regime is introduced.</p>\n<p>Studies show the introduction of a GRCM in a single member state would push carousel fraud out of the Czech Republic to other member states who are trade partners. </p>\n<p>The introduction of a GRCM would lead to other types of fraud that are  much harder to tackle. Introducing  another temporary system would put a large bureaucratic burden on Czech businesses, forcing them to maintain parallel domestic VAT regimes (as the GRCM only applies above a certain threshold per invoice).</p>\n<p>Czech authorities have a powerful tool to hand that can significantly reduce risk of VAT fraud – information on transactions subject to VAT that is well-tracked in the Czech Republic. Effective and efficient use of data seems to be a better solution.</p>\n<p>It seems that EU cooperation in tax matters is still a new area and a trial and error approach is sometimes inevitable. Let us hope that the ultimate outcome will serve a purpose and lead to an EU with fair, transparent tax policies supporting fair market competition, efficient tax collection and healthy public finances.</p>\n<p class=\"callaction\"><b>Luděk Niedermayer is a Czech economist and former vice governor of the Czech National Bank.
