Neil Johnson investigates the ramifications of this new way of working","body":"<p class=\"dropcap\">The abrupt volte-face by the chancellor, Philip Hammond, over his proposal to increase National Insurance contributions (NIC), a week after announcing it as a cornerstone of his 2017 Budget, would have been keenly watched (and a sense of anguish perhaps shared) by tax policy makers around the world.</p>\n<p>With Hammond trying to align NIC for the UK’s self-employed closer to that of the country’s employed, he was attempting to tackle a growing concern facing governments globally: just what do you do, from fiscal and labour policy perspectives, about the growing number of self-employed, entrepreneurs and “gig” workers?</p>\n<p>“Philip Hammond climbing down on NI created huge waves in the political pond, but what he threw in was really a very small pebble,” says John Boulton, manager of technical strategy in ICAEW’s Technical Strategy Department. “There is a huge potential landslide of rocks hanging precariously that is about to hit the pond, and government needs to give itself the flexibility to address the problems in the NI system.”</p>\n<p>Key for the UK government, and likewise governments internationally, is addressing issues arising around tax. The tax base is set up around the notion that people are full-time employees paying a higher level of tax than self-employed people alongside employer contributions.</p>\n<p>Yet people’s desire for self-employment, linked to flexible working and lifestyle choices at more senior professional levels, and necessity due to fewer permanent roles or needing supplemental income at lower levels, means there is pressure on the tax base, with the self-employed Class 4 NIC contribution (9%) lower than that for people who are employed (12%).</p>\n<p>“There is a desire for people to take advantage of the lower rates of tax,” says Boulton. “We have said that tax motivates behaviour and there have been plenty of people who have chosen to become self-employed for the tax benefits.”</p>\n<p>And while Boulton considers it inevitable that the UK government will move to protect the tax base, it is faced with a balancing act: how do you increase taxes without discouraging or penalising entrepreneurial activity, which is good for the economy?</p>\n<p>Furthermore, lower tax is an incentive for entrepreneurialism and self-employment, particularly given the instability: work and income may be irregular and unpredictable; you’re foregoing some social rights, such as contribution related pension entitlement, statutory sick pay and contribution to jobseekers allowance.</p>\n<p>The value of the benefits of self-employment and entrepreneurialism to individuals and the countries in which they reside need to be weighed against the risks to them. For example, in the UK, the Office of National Statistics regards growing self-employment as a “defining characteristic” of the post-global financial crisis economic recovery.</p>\n<p>“But right now,” says Ravin Jesuthasan, managing director and global practice leader at business advisory Willis Towers Watson, “I don’t think any government has figured out how to deal with the shrinking tax base as work leaves. And arguably it’s an extension of the problems we had with outsourcing, because work left the UK and the US, moved over to India or China and that further shrank the tax base, which makes it harder for governments to keep reskilling people in order to be relevant.”</p>\n<p>This is surely concerning news for all involved. While it may seem that global self-employment is currently like the Wild West, a free-for-all where opportunity appears limitless and yet the landscape unpoliceable, it’s not just governments facing a “precarious landslide of issues”. </p>\n<h2 class=\"noindent\"><b>PRECARIOUSNESS</b></h2><p class=\"noindent\">SOAS professor Guy Standing describes a fragmented yet connected network of “the precariat”: a fast-growing global socio-political group that share an increasingly precarious lack of job security, with a fragmentation along class lines being drawn up within professions themselves, as opposed to certain professions belonging to classes.</p>\n<p>“You now have elites within all the professions, the salariat and a growing precariat beneath,” said Standing. “The division of labour has changed. For example, the legal profession has silks at the top, then salariat lawyers and a huge growth of paralegals with basic training, but without a career path through the profession, because there are ceilings. It’s the same in the medical and teaching professions. The precariat is not just a reality, it’s grown extremely fast in recent years. Unless something is done to improve security and redress the class-based inequalities arising, you’re going to get a political monster.”</p>\n<p>And if little progress is made by governments to address the security and protection of workforces, such a “political monster” stands a better chance of becoming a reality.</p>\n<p>Yet, emphasising the multifarious nature of a gigging, entrepreneurial and self-employed workforce, many accounting and finance professionals wouldn’t necessarily recognise themselves along these lines, or associate with a wider insecure group, even though theirs is a profession under intense change due to technological innovation.</p>\n<p>Luke Streeter left his job as a senior partner at PwC’s small business service My Financepartner in January 2017 to set up the “technology enabled” accounting practice flinder, which aims to work with SMEs and entrepreneurs and provide rich insight into all their business data. For Streeter, the security worries that may come with such a bold move aren’t something that play on his mind.</p>\n<p>“I approached the decision as my next career choice rather than my last,” he says. “While I hope (and think) flinder will be a big success, allowing it to be my last move, it isn’t something that particularly phases me. Also, I know that experienced accountants who do what we do are in high demand.”</p>\n<p>But while such demand for experienced professionals is driving people to seek greater work flexibility and personal satisfaction through entrepreneurial projects or as self-employed service providers, the other end of the spectrum is more precarious. People doing lower level tasks and those seeking to gain an initial foothold on the career ladder are losing the security of full-time, traditional work opportunities and turning to the “gig economy”. </p>\n<h2 class=\"noindent\"><b>IT'S NOT JUST UBER</b></h2><p class=\"noindent\">Growing self-employment is a tangible phenomenon. According to a McKinsey Global Institute (MGI) survey entitled Independent work: Choice, necessity and the gig economy from October 2016, 20-30% of the working age populations in the US and EU-15 are engaged in independent work; while 42% of executives surveyed in Deloitte’s Global Human Capital Trends 2016 report expect to increase or significantly increase the use of contingent workers in the next three to five years.</p>\n<p>MGI defines three key features of its independent worker model: 1) a high degree of autonomy, flexibility and control; 2) payment by task, assignment or sales; and 3) short-term relationships between the worker and the customer. In the gig economy you can negotiate prices and timeframes, decline and accept work as you like, perform one off tasks for multiple clients or regular jobs for a few.</p>\n<p>And while often associated with Uber, Deliveroo, or more menial back-office tasks, gigging encompasses a far broader spread of business demands – if you need something, you’ll probably find someone with the right skills and level of expertise to do it, anywhere in the world, and it won’t necessarily be cheap because it’s a “gig”.</p>\n<p>“What we’re finding around the world is that it’s very easy for companies to take a piece of work, deconstruct it and distribute parts of it anywhere in the world,” says Jesuthasan.</p>\n<p>Global freelancing platforms such as Upwork, which has around 13 million registered users worldwide, with the US the largest base, also has huge user bases in India, China and Malaysia. It allows companies anywhere in the world to take a task and essentially shift it to those individuals.</p>\n<p>And “task”, as opposed to “job”, is the crucial term here, says Jesuthasan. “AI doesn’t affect jobs, it affects tasks. AI can take all the routine tasks that form a job, and unfortunately for accounting and legal, there is a significant amount of work being done at the lowest levels that are highly routine, which is where we first saw these talent platforms really taking off, because you could find freelance accountants and attorneys, and they would do the work in a fraction of the cost.”</p>\n<p>But it’s worth noting the positive flipside for human capital, particularly in the services sectors. In PwC’s UK Economic Outlook in March, it posed the question “Will robots steal our jobs?” While its analysis suggests up to 30% of UK jobs are at risk of being automated, automation in AI and robotics “will both create some totally new jobs in the digital technology area and, through productivity gains, generate additional wealth and spending that will support additional jobs of existing kinds, primarily in services sectors that are less easy to automate”.</p>\n<p>Combine this with Deloitte’s Global Human Capital 2016 report finding that 76% of executives expect automation to create a need for new skills in the workplace in the next one to three years, and there are significant opportunities for people to upskill and offer their expertise ad hoc to a transitioning global business landscape.</p>\n<p>While some countries, through fiscal and labour policy, and pro-entrepreneurial culture, appear to be encouraging self-employment, the real enabler is technology: digital job marketplaces, which connect workers and clients across borders, and the ability for people to find and service clients over the internet and using the cloud. The digital space in which these networks are being built presents many challenges for any singular government to regulate or bring it under its own umbrella of laws and protections.</p>\n<p>A report by the University of Oxford entitled The Risks and Rewards of Online Gig Work at the Global Margins highlights the risks versus rewards for people using digital platforms. The report surveyed a platform’s user base in sub-Saharan Africa and south-east Asia, and while the value of the rewards is significant, the list of risks they noted is far longer. The rewards include higher income, and autonomy and task diversity.</p>\n<p>The risks related to workforce oversupply, employment insecurity, opacity and taxation, discrimination based on country of residence, social isolation and overwork.</p>\n<p>One of the report’s authors, Professor Mark Graham, has suggested creating an international framework to protect actors in the new global gig economy, including creating a Fair Work foundation (as opposed to Fairtrade) and a transnational digital workers’ union.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, the world’s countries and regions are all experiencing a transition in their workforces and they’re all at different stages of this transition. And while transnational cooperation to protect the self-employed and secure tax bases may appear a step too far in the light of Trump’s protectionism, Brexit’s confusion and Hammond’s inability to enact a tax bump, it’s likely that self-employment growth will continue unabated and precariously in the digital playground.</p>\n<h2 class=\"noindent\"><b>ENCOURAGING ENTREPRENEURIALISM: WHICH COUNTRIES ARE MAKING IT EASIER TO BE SELF-EMPLOYED, AND WHICH ONES ARE RESTRICTING IT?</b></h2><p class=\"noindent\">While its government did attempt to implement a tax hike that would have left self-employed people worse off, the UK remains fertile ground for entrepreneurial activity, with a 31% increase over 2007-2016, thanks to strong infrastructure, connectivity and legal framework.</p>\n<p>Similarly, the US is highly amenable, with innovation in Silicon Valley an outlier for entrepreneurial activity and the country’s ease of access to capital.</p>\n<p>The Economist called Singapore “the world’s most tightly dubbed entrepreneurial ecosystem” with a start-up environment supported by good infrastructure, connectivity and access to capital.</p>\n<p>Australia has an emerging start-up scene, which is hindered slightly by high initial costs and high wages, but makes up for it with good connectivity, infrastructure and transparent business practices.</p>\n<p>The countries in which entrepreneurial activity is harder to conduct are where high levels of corruption are present and where the ease of doing business score is low, which unfortunately is many countries in Africa. Also, prohibitive levels of red tape are off-putting in a number of countries, including Brazil.</p>\n","layout":{"landscape":{"id":"am-dp1-layout17","link":"story-landscape-layout9.html"},"portrait":{"id":"am-dp1-layout18","link":"story-portrait-layout9.html"}},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":"","link_source":"","image":[{"id":"23e30d8be8ce4fda4083da6cab835874","name":"Precariat","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com/var/economia/storage/images/precariat/124600-1-eng-GB/precariat_story_img_size_768x929.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"768","height":"929","is_default":true},{"id":"23e30d8be8ce4fda4083da6cab835874","name":"Precariat","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com/var/economia/storage/images/precariat/124600-1-eng-GB/precariat_story_img_size_1024x673.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"1024","height":"673","is_default":false}],"url_alias":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com","type":"story","order":"18","folio_number":"","folio_numbers":"","pdf_page_index":"0","thumbnail":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com/var/economia/storage/images/precariat/124600-1-eng-GB/precariat_tablet_story_thumbnail.jpg","color":"ed1c24","real_id":"13711","main_section_id":"1290","ads":[]},{"id":"c03f9ddb705232ffec4fd2ae50ad5af3","title":"Back for good","sub_title":"","author":[{"id":"0","name":"Emily Black","email":"emily.black@progressivecp.com","is_default":false}],"tag":"","strap_line":"Jo Hunter","short_intro":"Jo Hunter explains how she takes so much from her two charity finance roles","intro":"After becoming a mother, Jo Hunter thought her accountancy days were over. Then she found her way back, and her calling, as an active board member of two charities. She tells Amy Duff why she was moved to use her ACA training for good","body":"<p class=\"dropcap\">When Paula Sussex, chief executive of the Charity Commission, spoke at ICAEW’s Annual Dinner in March this year, she praised members for their contribution to the sector (one in five chartered accountants are volunteers) but she also flagged a problem. The public’s trust and confidence in charities has, for various reasons, been significantly shaken recently. Supporting the good governance and stewardship of charities via the role of trustee or treasurer is, she said, “needed now more than ever”.</p>\n<p>The public could be reassured, said Sussex, if they were to see higher standards for raising and managing money, a clear explanation from the charity about what it does, and practical examples of what a difference the charity is making to its cause. Step forward Jo Hunter, who applies her financial, commercial and administrative skills to two charities – as co-founder and honorary treasurer of Smart Works and chair of Action for Stammering Children – and speaks articulately about how she dedicates her time to both.</p>\n<p>Even though she left the profession a couple of decades ago (to raise her family and do some tax and consultancy work) Hunter says she still has PwC – “a fantastic organisation” – coursing through her veins. She studied economics and social sciences at university (her interest in business inspired by her entrepreneurial father) and joined the Big Four firm in 1982 to gain a professional qualification.</p>\n<p>She speaks fondly of her time there – she still has many friends from that early 1980s intake – and can’t emphasise enough how influential it was. “I loved audit, the experience of meeting people and the variety of industries and companies,” she recalls. “It’s stood me in such good stead for everything else I’ve done since: that variety and the discipline of the training, which I think is second to none.”</p>\n<p>Asked to pick out the skills she acquired as a novice that she relies upon most now, she chooses the rigour of the training. Corporate governance failings could spell disaster for a charity and the disciplined thinking of a chartered accountant is defence against them. “I’m very keen on following the rules, that part of the training lives with you forever,” she explains. “You might not remember section something-or-other, but you do think, ‘hang on, this is a question I should ask’. You never know all the answers but you know when to ask the questions,” she says. Managing conflicts of interest, making reasonable decisions, ensuring financial controls are effective – all of those are second nature.</p>\n<p>The confidence she gained as an eager young accountant wasn’t as long-lasting. She had cut her teeth in the 1980s when “in honesty, it was quite a tough environment for a woman. Very exciting and fun, a bit crazy, but quite male-dominated. A very different place to how it is now.” After quite a few years out of the workplace doing consultancy work, she found she wasn’t as self-assured. “It happens to a lot of women at that stage, I think. As more time went by I thought, ‘I’m never going to be able to go back to a full-time job because I’m out of date’. I just thought, ‘I’m a mother, I can’t do it anymore’.”</p>\n<p>Call it serendipity, synchronicity, what you will, Hunter found herself involved in an organisation that helped the type of person she identified with. Dress for Success was an American non-profit set up to help women get back into the workplace by providing professional attire and support (in interviewing skills, for example). It had an affiliate base in London, where a friend of Hunter’s needed some help with a funding application. By the end of the week. “I told her I’d never done a set of charity accounts, and didn’t think I could. But then I thought, if someone’s desperate then I am doing a favour, so I did the accounts, we did the funding application together and we were successful.”</p>\n<p>That favour led to Hunter working for Dress for Success on a more permanent basis. Not for the last time during this interview, her recollection of what a difference a charity can make comes emotionally charged. She recalls a client waiting in reception who couldn’t make eye contact and “looked downtrodden and miserable. She went into the dressing room and came back a completely different person. I thought, someone has sprinkled fairy dust over her. She was totally different, she now had confidence and self-esteem to get a job. It was then that I got it, the magic of this place.”</p>\n<p>The London affiliate became one of the most successful in the worldwide organisation and, because it wanted to expand its dressing sessions and one-on-one support to women regionally, chair Juliet Hughes-Hallett and treasurer Hunter broke away from the American organisation and rebranded as a UK-based charity. Four years later, with CEO Kate Stephens on board, it now operates in Edinburgh, Manchester, Birmingham, Reading and, of course, London, and has been shortlisted for the Charity Awards 2017.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"right\" ><span class=\"hide\">\"</span><p>It’s a particular moment in their lives, they’ve got a job interview and we give them that helping hand to get over the finishing line. In 90 minutes you can transform somebody’s life. They come to us from prisons, homeless charities, job centres... they need our service, they’re ready to get the job</p>\n<span class=\"hide\">\"</span></blockquote>\n<p>Hunter’s not surprised by how successful Smart Works has become – “it’s a very good business model, volunteer-led with all clothes donated”. It has supported 7,000 women and she is proud of its success rate: “Sixty per cent go on to get the job and 40% of them are lone parents, so these are people who’ve struggled; 25% have been unemployed for more than three years. They’ve been to a lot of interviews but they’re virtually giving up at this point. And then they’re referred to us.”</p>\n<p class=\"dropcap\">The magic is conjured by collaboration between the private sector and volunteers (of which there is a waiting list). The former provides the high-quality interview clothes, the latter provide the styling advice and interview training. Hunter says: “The donated clothes are either from City corporates, companies like Barclays or PwC, which run clothing drives for us. Or retailers such as Hobbs or Whistles give us end-of-line stock. I’d say about 40% of our clothes are new but they’re all high quality clothes. The staff that do the dressing are highly-trained volunteers – it’s not just about being a stylist, it’s about having empathy with clients – and then we get HR professionals to do one-to-one interview coaching, which can be tailored to their needs and the job they’re going to.”</p>\n<p>You could think of it as an intervention, says Hunter: “It’s a particular moment in their lives, they’ve got a job interview and we give them that helping hand to get over the finishing line. In 90 minutes, really, you can transform somebody’s life. They come to us from prisons, homeless charities, job centres. We ask for a referral so we know they need our service, that they’re ready to get the job.”</p>\n<p>And the charity’s direction is unlikely to change, says Hunter. Its success rate is high, and “we have decided we should really concentrate on what we’re good at and not be tempted to deviate from our core service. We’re not going to grow too fast because that’s risky and you can damage your brand or reduce the quality of your service. We’re proud of everything we’ve achieved so it would be terrible to stretch ourselves too thin or open up too quickly in areas that don’t need us.” She adds: “Each UK centre has opened up as an independent charity, so each needs a dynamic chair; board members to drive it through. It’s hard work and you need to have the time, energy and vision. It’s a particular skillset so we’re careful who we work with.”</p>\n<p>They’re frugal, too, especially in what is a difficult fundraising climate. “We do need to generate money, we have to pay the rent and the salaries. But we have no other costs, we’re a very lean machine in that respect,” she says with her PwC hat on. “While it’s a simple model when it’s working well, to start it up is hard work. And success is never straightforward to replicate. There are issues we might not even have thought about.”</p>\n<p>But don’t get her wrong, it’s not a complete world of pain. In fact, she says, she and Hughes-Hallett agreed on the importance of enjoying their work. “Juliet was brought in [to Dress for Success] by the same friend. I used to go in on a Tuesday to do my treasury work and she was there dressing, so we formed a connection. When she became chair we kind of ran it together, we’re yin and yang. She has fantastic energy and ideas, a background in fashion [she worked at Vogue] and is outward-going, and I’m there with my radar thinking, what are the risks? But she has always said, ‘every day has got to be fun’. And it has been. I do this on a voluntary basis because I want to give back but also it’s nice to have fun while you’re doing it.”</p>\n<p>Hunter is equally passionate about Action for Stammering Children (ASC), which on the face of it is a completely different kettle of fish to Smart Works, but actually has a similar goal: to help give confidence back. Our interview takes place at the Michael Palin Centre for Stammering Children, to which the actor gave his name following his role in A Fish Called Wanda, where he portrayed the memorable, stammering Ken (Palin’s father also suffered from stammering all his life). As Hunter recalls, ASC was looking for a treasurer in her mould. Her, basically. But she simply couldn’t see how she had time to fit them in. “I met some of the therapists anyway and they showed me a video of Michael Palin talking about the children and handed me the tissue box. Streaming with tears I said: ‘OK, I’ll help you’. I was interviewed, I got the treasury job and I just fell in love with it.”</p>\n<p>It’s not difficult to see why the tears and why the love. The charity provides specialist assessments and therapy for stammering children, and it also funds the training of speech and language therapists and research. As a parent, Hunter knows how difficult it can be to raise a child. But to raise a child where stammering, a severe communication disability that frequently becomes a focus for teasing and bullying, is involved, is even more so. “I was treasurer for six years, I think, and when the chair retired I was asked to take it over. I’m the only one on the board that doesn’t have a direct connection with stammering, but I’m so passionate about it now. I absolutely love this charity.”</p>\n<p class=\"dropcap\">Although it has a stellar group of trustees and supporters (as well as Palin, The King’s Speech star Colin Firth and Ed Balls are also vice presidents), the charity still struggles with fundraising and Hunter falls back on her training often.</p>\n<p>“Fundraising is a massive challenge,” she says, “and we’re more reliant on trusts and foundations here. It’s tough. It’s a niche condition, it’s relatively low incidence (about 150,000 children) but has such a high impact. Getting that message across is harder [than Smart Works] so we’ve got a bigger job in that respect. But I enjoy the challenge and I’ve enjoyed moving from the treasurer to the chair role, although I had to let go of my spreadsheets.”</p>\n<p>Busy as she is, I wonder whether she has considered following in her father’s footsteps and starting her own business – she has the contacts, the wisdom. “That’s a good question. If anything, I’d start up my own charity. I don’t think I’d go back into the business world now. The people you meet in the charity sector are inspirational; so many are doing things in their free time. Everyone’s working hard and I love that. This is more rewarding.”</p>\n<p>She’s equally effusive about the ACA, and feels she wouldn’t be doing something she loves so much without it. “I’m so grateful for it; it’s enabled me to do something that I’m passionate about and I can give something back and it’s useful. I married an accountant, he’s still at PwC, and I’m going to have an accountant for a son (he’s training at Deloitte). I think it’s a fabulous career,” she says.</p>\n<p>On our way out of the Michael Palin Centre, we pass a therapist helping a young child. I catch Hunter’s eye and quickly say my goodbyes. I haven’t got any tissues, you see.</p>\n<div class=\"am_info_box\">\n\t<fieldset>\n\t<legend><div>CAREER IN A NUTSHELL</div></legend>\n\t<div class=\"text\"><p><b>1982</b> Graduated, BA in economics and social sciences, University of East Anglia</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>1986</b> Qualified, Price Waterhouse</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>1993</b> Financial controller, Torus</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>2007</b> Treasurer/trustee, Dress for Success London</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>2008</b> Treasurer/trustee, Action for Stammering Children  </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>2013</b> Co-founder, treasurer/trustee, Smart Works</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>2014</b> Chair, Action for Stammering Children</p>\n</div>\n\t</fieldset>\n</div>","layout":{"landscape":{"id":"am-dp1-layout9","link":"story-landscape-layout5.html"},"portrait":{"id":"am-dp1-layout10","link":"story-portrait-layout5.html"}},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":"","link_source":"","image":[{"id":"1640761060481a39d72be2642897167a","name":"Jo-Hunter","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com/var/economia/storage/images/jo-hunter/124625-1-eng-GB/jo-hunter_story_img_size_768x929.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"768","height":"929","is_default":true},{"id":"1640761060481a39d72be2642897167a","name":"Jo-Hunter","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com/var/economia/storage/images/jo-hunter/124625-1-eng-GB/jo-hunter_story_img_size_1024x673.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"1024","height":"673","is_default":false}],"url_alias":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com","type":"story","order":"19","folio_number":"","folio_numbers":"","pdf_page_index":"0","thumbnail":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com/var/economia/storage/images/jo-hunter/124625-1-eng-GB/jo-hunter_tablet_story_thumbnail.jpg","color":"ed1c24","real_id":"13714","main_section_id":"1290","ads":[]},{"id":"afa0aba17e1eb210648457e9514aa3e8","title":"Beyond belief","sub_title":"","author":[{"id":"0","name":"Emily Black","email":"emily.black@progressivecp.com","is_default":false}],"tag":"","strap_line":"Communication","short_intro":"Is there a role for accountants in stopping the spread of fake news?","intro":"When false news spreads like wildfire, businesses and their accountants have the opportunity to reinforce their position as the guardians of truth and trust. Iwona Tokc-Wilde investigates","body":"<p class=\"dropcap\">Post-truth, an adjective describing “circumstances in which objective facts are less influential in shaping public opinion than appeals to emotion”, was the Oxford Dictionaries 2016 word of the year. Its use increased by 2,000% last year, particularly in the context of Brexit and Donald Trump’s march towards presidential victory in the US.</p>\n<p>The post-truth phenomenon has many guises. Fake news, half-truths, one-sided arguments and twisted, exaggerated or invented facts and figures deceive, manipulate and control the masses. The truth is irrelevant to those who can so easily advance political causes by feeding off the public’s deeply ingrained grievances and insecurities, and the growing distrust of the establishment.</p>\n<p>In the run-up to the EU referendum, the Leave camp said Britain “sends the EU £350m a week”. The net amount is closer to £136m per week, less than 40% of the amount splashed on those battle buses. As for claims made by Donald Trump, fact-checking website PolitiFact has found 69% of them to be false or mostly false, 14% half-true and only 17% mostly true or true.</p>\n<p>Kevin Morrell, professor of Strategy at Warwick Business School, says: “Post-truth isn’t merely about lying and although we associate it with politics, it also signals a loss of faith in regular news channels and a change in the way news is produced and consumed.” This year’s Trust Barometer by Edelman, the communications marketing firm, shows the traditional media is distrusted in more than 80% of the 33 countries surveyed. It is now viewed as part of the elite, politicised and unable to meet its reporting obligations because of economic pressures.</p>\n<p>Michael Stewart, global vice chairman at Edelman, comments: “The mainstream media is under unprecedented pressure. Declining advertising revenues and resources have led to a reduction in the number of investigative journalists. Meanwhile, news outlets are expected not only to drive engagement via click-bait headlines, but also to keep up with instantaneous social media and get a story out fast. These factors can make it easier for fake news to go unchecked or be picked up inadvertently.” Edelman finds that people favour search engines over human editors. So sooner or later they stumble across sites impersonating news organisations, although Google has started shutting them down.  </p>\n<p>Or they turn to Facebook. According to Journalism.org, six in 10 US adults now get their news from social media. It is unsurprising then that during the last three months of the US presidential election campaign, fake election news on Facebook got more clicks, likes, shares and comments than real news stories from the New York Times, Washington Post and NBC News, a Buzzfeed News analysis shows. Facebook has recently started flagging “disputed” stories but its verification process is so long the stories stay unlabelled for days and have every chance of going viral.</p>\n<h2 class=\"noindent\"><b>CORPORATE BOMBSHELLS</b></h2><p class=\"noindent\">The post-truth problem is also infecting the world of business. In November 2016, shares in the French construction giant Vinci fell by more than 18% after a fake press release said the company would restate its accounts and sack its chief finance officer. Vinci’s website states the hoax claim was first published by Bloomberg. It was then picked up by other mainstream media. Today every business needs to be ready to face this type of crisis.</p>\n<p>Lily Kennett, director of intelligence at reputation and privacy consultancy Schillings, says organisations need to invest more than ever in information and preparation, and become much more imaginative, broad-minded and forward-thinking about how they achieve both of those things. She explains: “They need to take control of their information environment and consider what information is available about their organisation, their executives and key partners, and whether it needs to be in the public domain.” She adds that if the information is irrevocably in the public domain, they need to think ahead, consider how it might be used or misrepresented and be prepared to respond.</p>\n<p>Planning for fake news is difficult, so being on guard for falsehoods as well as having agreed plans for handling such scenarios is critical, says independent board adviser Tony Friend. “This involves having real-time media monitoring, endeavouring to have the fake news taken down immediately and removed for search engines, and getting a clarification statement out to the market swiftly,” he says. Vinci issued an immediate denial, confirmed it was the victim of impersonation, and asked the French regulator AMF to investigate who could have benefited from the stock price manipulation.</p>\n<p>Stewart says there may be circumstances when it is better to let the story play out, but adds: “Leading news outlets will set the record straight, but the business needs to correct those errors because mainstream coverage often drives opinion pieces, blogs and shares on social media that keep the false story alive,” he says. But he also adds that simply relying on the mainstream media and social channels to tell your true story is not enough. “Fostering direct, quality engagement with customers and stakeholders has never been more important.”</p>\n<blockquote class=\"right\" ><span class=\"hide\">\"</span><p>The speed at which a company issued a full denial of allegations contained in a research report was suspicious. The denial came minutes after the report was released so how could the company have read the report in such a short time, let alone assess the validity of the claims? It was felt such a rapid, comprehensive denial was aimed to protect the company’s share price and demonstrated an unwillingness to acknowledge and address concerns</p>\n<span class=\"hide\">\"</span></blockquote>\n<p>However, Kennett warns against knee-jerk reactions: “An analyst at a major investment bank recently told me that the speed at which a company issued a full denial of allegations contained in a research report was suspicious. The denial came minutes after the report was released so how could the company have read the report in such a short time, let alone assess the validity of the claims? The analyst felt such a rapid, comprehensive denial was aimed to protect the company’s share price and demonstrated an unwillingness to acknowledge and address concerns.” She adds: “You only get one shot at a first response, so you need to get it right.”</p>\n<p>Arguably though, we have more access to truth. If the Panama Papers leak had happened a decade ago, the story might not have been written because no one had the technology and skills to make sense of such a massive dataset. Generally, however, Friend advises treating corporate leaks with caution: “Not every leak is the truth, let alone the full truth, so take care and work out who benefits from the story.”</p>\n<p>Professor Morrell says information channels may be used as avenues for legitimate whistleblowing or for championing consumer or employee rights. But he also says: “Even such disclosures may be motivated by an agenda. We might get evidence of conspiracy and wrongdoing, but we never get the whole story. Leaking a corporate scandal prior to a takeover bid could distort the market badly.”<b> </b></p>\n<blockquote class=\"right\" ><span class=\"hide\">\"</span><p>Business is the last retaining wall for trust, but its leaders must step up on the issues that matter for society.

The 2017 Edelman Trust Barometer shows that people are losing faith not just in the media, governments and NGOs, but also in business, at a higher rate than ever before. For business, the most concerning element is the perceived role the public sees it playing in the threat of lost jobs due to globalisation, immigration, lack of skills training and automation.</p>\n<p>Yet the survey also shows that among those who are uncertain about whether the current overall “system” is working for them, out of the four institutions, people trust business the most. Kathryn Beiser, global chair of Edelman’s corporate practice, says: “Business is the last retaining wall for trust, but its leaders must step up on the issues that matter for society. It has done a masterful job of illustrating the benefits of innovation but has done little to discuss the impact those advances will have on people’s jobs. Business must also focus on paying employees fairly, while providing better benefits and job training.</p>\n<p>“One of my clients moved ahead of the curve three or four years ago and introduced a living wage for all their staff, partly so that they were able to attract better quality candidates, but also to help reposition their corporate brand as one that was ethical and trustworthy,” says Stuart Cross, business strategy consultant at Morgan Cross Consulting.</p>\n<p>According to the Edelman Trust Barometer, employees are now perceived as more credible than CEOs when speaking on every aspect of a company’s business, even financial earnings and crises. “If you treat them well and involve them in your future, they will help you not only get your message out but also protect your reputation,” says Stewart.</p>\n<p>Leaders can increase their trustworthiness if they make themselves more visible and more “real”. Cross says: “Michael O’Leary of Ryanair is seen as someone who tells it like it is, as opposed to just being a corporate suit. If a situation arose in Ryanair, people would trust his version of events over the fake story. Or, at the very least, he would receive a reasonable hearing.”</p>\n<p>Professor Zahir Irani, dean of the University of Bradford’s School of Management, thinks the post-truth landscape is an opportunity for organisations and their leaders to assert some clarity and to position themselves as responsible institutions with high standards of respect for truth, unbiased thinking and genuine expertise. “Brexit and Trump have challenged the need for experts and, in some respect, reset what defines expertise. Businesses need to be clear about the nature of their expertise – how experts get ethical training, and how they have an awareness of their responsibilities that impact the society,” he says.</p>\n<h2 class=\"noindent\"><b>TRUST ME, I'M AN EXPERT</b></h2><p class=\"noindent\">Accountants have a big role to play in helping businesses achieve this, but “the profession could do with new thinking about how to respond to client needs in this new world”, says Henry Irving, head of ICAEW’s Audit and Assurance Faculty. “A strong, engaged, local presence in communities will help them promote the right business thinking and values.” Amid a popular backlash against the opinions of experts, the profession also needs to reinforce the view that professional expertise and scepticism are vital linchpins of trust. “We need to offer a USP in this sensitive space: accountants generally, and the globally branded firms in particular, are perceived by many as the self-serving establishment and therefore do not have populist credentials,” says Irving.</p>\n<p class=\"callaction\"><b>The ICAEW Audit Quality Forum is running a Believe me, I’m an expert? event on 12 June, on the value and limitation of experts in helping clients do the right thing to improve confidence in business.</b></p>\n","layout":{"landscape":{"id":"am-dp1-layout19","link":"story-landscape-layout10.html"},"portrait":{"id":"am-dp1-layout20","link":"story-portrait-layout10.html"}},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":"","link_source":"","image":[{"id":"93c5b646247ff11fabfe364bcb2a082b","name":"Post-truth-type","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com/var/economia/storage/images/post-truth-type/124650-1-eng-GB/post-truth-type_story_img_size_768x929.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"768","height":"929","is_default":true},{"id":"93c5b646247ff11fabfe364bcb2a082b","name":"Post-truth-type","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com/var/economia/storage/images/post-truth-type/124650-1-eng-GB/post-truth-type_story_img_size_1024x673.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"1024","height":"673","is_default":false}],"url_alias":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com","type":"story","order":"20","folio_number":"","folio_numbers":"","pdf_page_index":"0","thumbnail":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com/var/economia/storage/images/post-truth-type/124650-1-eng-GB/post-truth-type_tablet_story_thumbnail.jpg","color":"ed1c24","real_id":"13717","main_section_id":"1290","ads":[]},{"id":"22e852e95a48f7b1e02b781f9237c5b5","title":"Change of rates","sub_title":"","author":[{"id":"0","name":"Emily Black","email":"emily.black@progressivecp.com","is_default":false}],"tag":"","strap_line":"Business rates","short_intro":"","intro":"Ongoing controversy dogs the new business rates valuations in the UK. David Adams asks what effect this is having on small business and whether the system requires wholesale reform","body":"<p class=\"dropcap\">Some businesses across the UK are currently trying to cope with a big rise in their business rates bill following the 2016 revaluation. Chris Powell, for example, landlord of the Royal Oak pub in Bath, has seen his bill rise from £9,800 to £25,500, an increase he says he cannot understand – it seems well out of line with much smaller increases for other pubs nearby – and that may put him out of business.</p>\n<p>Case studies like these began to feature in the press during the run-up to the Budget in March. </p>\n<p>The government Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG) responded by saying that almost three-quarters of businesses would either see no change or a reduction in rate bills. DCLG also drew attention to a transitional relief system that will phase in increases over five years.</p>\n<p>Figures for average changes in bills in different parts of the country seem to back the government’s case. They show a reduction in every part of England outside London, including average reductions of 10% or more across regions in northern England. Only in London is there an average rise – of 11%. But averages can be misleading and are of little comfort to businesses struggling with big increases. High street retailers hit with big increases may feel particularly hard done by, as some of the online businesses with which they compete will pay much lower rates for out-of-town warehouses and distribution centres.</p>\n<p>Revaluations have also been taking place in Scotland and Wales. In Scotland, businesses in the hospitality sector in particular have reported big rises. But Scotland also has the most generous business rates relief in the UK. Its Small Business Bonus Scheme offers 100% relief for properties with a rateable value up to £15,000; and 50% for values between £15,001 and £18,000.</p>\n<p>In February, the Welsh government announced a £10m relief scheme for retailers facing big rate rises – 100% Small Business Rates relief is already available for rateable values up to £6,000, with tapered reliefs running down to zero for rateable values between £6,001 and £12,000. Under the new scheme, eligible retailers with rateable values between £6,000 and £12,000 will get a £500 discount, or have the bill cut to zero if it is less than £500. Those with rateable values between £12,001 and £50,000 will receive a £1,500 discount.</p>\n<p>Reliefs will be gratefully received by eligible businesses, assuming they can negotiate the complexities of the system. But many business owners will certainly agree with Mike Cherry, national chairman for the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB), when he describes business rates as “an unfair, regressive tax, not linked to a firm’s ability to pay”.</p>\n<p>Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium (BRC) says the current system “is no longer workable”; and “at odds with the government’s aspiration for a low tax economy”.</p>\n<p>In the Spring Budget, the chancellor Philip Hammond announced a £300m discretionary support fund that local authorities could use to support businesses facing the greatest difficulties; and said that tenant businesses set to lose small business rate relief would see business rate bills increase by no more than £50 per month. He also provided a £1,000 discount on business rates for pubs with a rateable value below £100,000.</p>\n<p>The BRC said that although new reliefs were welcome they also made a complex system even more complicated. The FSB’s Cherry also raises concerns about the appeals system, which has become more expensive and may mean companies are fined for mistakes made by other parties during valuation or appeal processes.</p>\n<p>So what could or should the government be doing to improve the system? One important change many want considered is increasing the frequency of valuations, a change that could involve some form of self-assessment system for smaller businesses. Arguably the main reason for the current row is that there have been no valuations for seven years, rather than the usual five.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"right\" ><span class=\"hide\">\"</span><p>Once devolution goes through we’ll be dealing with lots of different local government organisations. Set that in the context of the Brexit agenda and the chances of large-scale reform seem increasingly unlikely</p>\n<span class=\"hide\">\"</span></blockquote>\n<p>Clive Lewis, head of enterprise at ICAEW, notes that most of those who are happy with the current system still believe the frequency of valuations should increase. He thinks a self-assessment system should be considered: “With the ratepayer collecting information on their property, probably with the help of a property specialist”.</p>\n<p>The government could also bring forward a planned switch from linking business rates with the Retail Price Index (RPI) measure of inflation to the Consumer Price Index (CPI) measure, currently set to happen in April 2020. Chris Richards, senior business environment policy adviser at the manufacturers’ association EEF, says there is no good reason why this change should not be made earlier. Both EEF and the Institute of Directors (IoD) suggest capping rate increases for some businesses. “Why can’t the system say that if you occupy less than 5,000 square feet – for example – your rates can’t rise by more than 15%?” asks Stephen Herring, head of taxation at the IoD.</p>\n<p>Other sectors have more specific requests. Many manufacturers suggest that plant and machinery should no longer be included within the rateable value of premises.</p>\n<div class=\"am_info_box\">\n\t<fieldset>\n\t<legend><div>THE ROYAL OAK PUB, BATH</div></legend>\n\t<div class=\"text\"><p class=\"noindent\">When Chris Powell became landlord of this award-winning pub in 2010, its business rates bill was £9,800. Since the last valuation the pub’s floorplan has not changed, its rent has stayed the same and there have been relatively few changes in the local area. So Powell was horrified to be presented with a new bill for £25,500.</p>\n<p>He says the valuations office has told him his only course of action is to appeal against the decision, a process he now needs to try to learn about while also trying to run the business; and which can only begin once he starts paying the bill at the new rate.</p>\n<p>“I don’t know how they’ve arrived at this valuation,” he says. “There are four pubs within a 10-minute walk and their rates have only gone up by between £1,000 and £2,000.”</p>\n<p>He will get support from transitional arrangements put in place by the chancellor – “But I assume that’s only a stop-gap – so what happens once that money’s gone?”</p>\n<p>In the longer term if he is unable to reduce the bill significantly, the business may have to fold. “I think everyone should pay tax – that’s how public services are funded and I don’t mind having an increase,” he says. “But there’s been no explanation of why it’s going up by so much.”</p>\n</div>\n\t</fieldset>\n</div><p>The original rationale was that a manufacturer might move into premises already equipped with big ticket machinery, a far less common scenario today. Now, says Richards, including plant and machinery in business rates valuations represents “a tax on investment”.</p>\n<p>But it seems there is little chance of these ideas being implemented any time soon. “At the moment, the focus is on getting reliefs in place for businesses that will be affected this year,” says a spokesperson for DCLG. “There are no plans to revisit further reform of the system.”</p>\n<p>That makes more comprehensive reform of business taxation in general even less likely in the foreseeable future. Not that everyone thinks this is necessary. “We did a survey just before the Budget and a narrow majority thought business rates weren’t fit for purpose,” says Bill Dodwell, partner and leader of the tax policy group at Deloitte. “But a pretty large number thought the system was fine.”</p>\n\n<div class=\"object-left\"><div class=\"hide gallery\">\n<ul><li>0efabd6671f906730d5f6456ed72e9da</li><li>1226fffed44f145923b73e72a16b1243</li><li>b37efcdcd05ea8c035c4d67daa06cc09</li><li>6fbe07dfc4a9569d0e3a87d05712b01f</li><li>10c03102a68596bd61ce4e3c87b47432</li><li>a14309ffd2e7d0c27f10737772c0862a</li></ul>\n</div></div><p>But Christian Spence, a Chamber Fellow at the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), believes the system is “fundamentally flawed” while valuations remain infrequent and tied to the RPI. “It’s not responsive to economic cycles, at the macro-economic level, or at a local level,” he says.</p>\n<p>But he sees little prospect of a more wholesale reform of business taxation, including, for example, any reverse in the trend set by George Osborne during his tenure in the Treasury to keep reducing the headline rate of corporation tax. That seems a particularly distant prospect today, in the context of Brexit, with the UK government keen to attract or retain inward investment.</p>\n<p>The question will be complicated further still by the roll out of devolution plans in England, which will give devolved areas more control over how funds raised through business rates are spent.</p>\n<p>“Once devolution goes through we’re going to be dealing with lots of different local government organisations, rather than just the Treasury,” says Spence. “Set that in the context of the Brexit agenda and the chances of large-scale reform seem increasingly unlikely.” If so, at least accountants will have plenty of work to do in the meantime, helping clients to understand the system, or to consider steps they could take to reduce bills.</p>\n<p>Yet the current system cannot last forever, says Herring, particularly if it puts an increasing number of businesses into severe financial difficulty. “My guess is that the chancellor will have to do more about this in the Autumn Statement, or before,” he says. “I don’t think this story is going away.”</p>\n<div class=\"am_info_box\">\n\t<fieldset>\n\t<legend><div>CPJ FIELD</div></legend>\n\t<div class=\"text\"><p class=\"noindent\">Funeral directors CPJ Field was founded by Robert Field in 17th century London, and by 1901 the Field family had created a business that could be entrusted with the task of managing Queen Victoria’s funeral. Still owned by the family today, the firm now runs 37 funeral homes across south-east England, with administrative headquarters based in Burgess Hill, West Sussex. The business turns over about £10m per year and employs around 175 people.</p>\n<p>Deputy chairman Charlie Field says the business will be paying an extra £40,000 in business rates over the next five years. The results of the revaluation are varied: 67% of the property portfolio has seen an increase in rateable value, 10% a reduction and 23% no change. The biggest increase (70%) is for a property in Bromley; followed by 60% in Peckham. The biggest decreases were of 21% in Crawley and 15% in East Grinstead.</p>\n<p>Field would like to see reform that takes into account “the changing nature of consumer trends” – that is, the fact that “even the funeral industry is affected by the trend to do business online”.</p>\n<p>He would also like to see a greater share of the funding that business rates provide being used to support business.</p>\n<p>“At present business rates seem an expensive price for street lighting and clean pavements,” he says.</p>\n</div>\n\t</fieldset>\n</div>","layout":{"landscape":{"id":"am-dp1-layout11","link":"story-landscape-layout6.html"},"portrait":{"id":"am-dp1-layout12","link":"story-portrait-layout6.html"}},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":"","link_source":"","image":[{"id":"a01a380b75e8398cdea6ab0af209666b","name":"Business-rates","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com/var/economia/storage/images/business-rates/124811-1-eng-GB/business-rates_story_img_size_768x929.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"768","height":"929","is_default":true},{"id":"a01a380b75e8398cdea6ab0af209666b","name":"Business-rates","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com/var/economia/storage/images/business-rates/124811-1-eng-GB/business-rates_story_img_size_1024x673.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"1024","height":"673","is_default":false}],"related_objects":{"gallery":[[{"id":"0efabd6671f906730d5f6456ed72e9da","name":"Shop3","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com/var/economia/storage/images/shop3/124825-1-eng-GB/shop3_default_ipad_portrait.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"768","height":"576"},{"id":"0efabd6671f906730d5f6456ed72e9da","name":"Shop3","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com/var/economia/storage/images/shop3/124825-1-eng-GB/shop3_default_ipad_landscape.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"1024","height":"768"},{"id":"1226fffed44f145923b73e72a16b1243","name":"Shop4","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com/var/economia/storage/images/shop4/124826-1-eng-GB/shop4_default_ipad_portrait.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"768","height":"576"},{"id":"1226fffed44f145923b73e72a16b1243","name":"Shop4","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com/var/economia/storage/images/shop4/124826-1-eng-GB/shop4_default_ipad_landscape.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"1024","height":"768"},{"id":"b37efcdcd05ea8c035c4d67daa06cc09","name":"Shop6","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com/var/economia/storage/images/shop6/124851-1-eng-GB/shop6_default_ipad_portrait.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"768","height":"576"},{"id":"b37efcdcd05ea8c035c4d67daa06cc09","name":"Shop6","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com/var/economia/storage/images/shop6/124851-1-eng-GB/shop6_default_ipad_landscape.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"1024","height":"768"},{"id":"6fbe07dfc4a9569d0e3a87d05712b01f","name":"Shop5","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com/var/economia/storage/images/shop5/124844-1-eng-GB/shop5_default_ipad_portrait.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"768","height":"576"},{"id":"6fbe07dfc4a9569d0e3a87d05712b01f","name":"Shop5","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com/var/economia/storage/images/shop5/124844-1-eng-GB/shop5_default_ipad_landscape.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"1024","height":"768"},{"id":"10c03102a68596bd61ce4e3c87b47432","name":"Shop1","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com/var/economia/storage/images/shop1/124837-1-eng-GB/shop1_default_ipad_portrait.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"768","height":"576"},{"id":"10c03102a68596bd61ce4e3c87b47432","name":"Shop1","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com/var/economia/storage/images/shop1/124837-1-eng-GB/shop1_default_ipad_landscape.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"1024","height":"768"},{"id":"a14309ffd2e7d0c27f10737772c0862a","name":"Shop2","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com/var/economia/storage/images/shop2/124858-1-eng-GB/shop2_default_ipad_portrait.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"768","height":"576"},{"id":"a14309ffd2e7d0c27f10737772c0862a","name":"Shop2","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com/var/economia/storage/images/shop2/124858-1-eng-GB/shop2_default_ipad_landscape.jpg","portrait

against aggressive tax avoidance?","intro":"After a number of high-profile cases, HMRC is spearheading a fightback against aggressive tax avoidance schemes. Nick Martindale looks at new measures designed to ensure every organisation pays its share","body":"<p class=\"dropcap\">For many years, there was a notable difference between tax avoidance, which is legal, and evasion, which is not. In recent years, however, the prevailing mood from government, the media and the public as a whole has shifted, on the back of high-profile cases such as the K2 scheme, used by a number of celebrities including comedian Jimmy Carr and footballer Wayne Rooney.</p>\n<p>Now the view is that schemes designed purely to help businesses or individuals reduce their tax liability should not be tolerated, even if such arrangements may be technically within the letter – if not the spirit – of the law.</p>\n<p>HMRC has also acted to reduce the opportunities available for people and organisations to avoid paying their share of tax. “We have seen a significant strengthening of positions in recent years,” says Frank Haskew, head of tax at ICAEW. “It really started in earnest with the disclosure of tax avoidance scheme rules back in 2004.” These rules have been amended virtually every year since, he says. “The pace of change increased further with the introduction of the general anti abuse rule [GAAR] in 2013, followed in 2014 by follower notices, accelerated payments and rules aimed at countering the promoters of tax avoidance schemes.”</p>\n<p>Other measures have included the senior accounting officer (SAO) regime introduced in 2009, the large business tax strategy regime and the serial tax avoiders regime of 2016. Finally, there are proposals for penalties on the enablers of tax avoidance, which are likely to be reintroduced in the Finance Bill published after the election on 8 June 2017.</p>\n<p>The early signs are that such measures are having an impact. HMRC says its most recent figures reveal an extra £26bn was brought in as a result of the crackdown, with £7.3bn coming from the 2,100 largest and most complex businesses in the UK. “We are clear that all businesses must pay the taxes due under the law,” an HMRC spokesman told economia. “Everyone must play by the same rules.”</p>\n<p>One area that has certainly focused attention is the SAO regime, which introduced the concept of holding individual finance directors or CFOs personally accountable for ensuring their tax reporting systems are up to speed. Initially HMRC took a light-touch approach, failing to issue fines for the first three years, but in 2015/16 handed out 181 fines of £5,000, according to Pinsent Masons; a rise of 17% from the previous year.</p>\n<p>“Senior executives and finance directors are, and will be, expected to play a leading role in ensuring compliance with the various regimes and ensuring increased transparency,” warns Lee Ellis, a barrister in the tax litigation team at Stewarts Law. “With large fines and much greater reputational damage at stake, it seems certain that breaches of these various regimes will have career-defining effects for many senior executives and finance directors.”</p>\n<p>A particular requirement for finance directors is to ensure financial statements disclose any form of tax planning, warns Steven Brice, partner, financial reporting advisory, at Mazars. “Ensuring that the substance of the transaction is reflected and that the transaction is adequately disclosed are two key ingredients,” he says.</p>\n<p>A further issue is that of advance payment notices, which requires those who have entered into certain tax planning arrangements to make payments of disputed amounts of tax in advance of those amounts being found to be due. “Even though HMRC has withdrawn hundreds of these following a judicial review, the issue has nevertheless made finance directors reconsider their attitude to tax risk,” says Brice.</p>\n<p>Further moves to hold individuals accountable are in the pipeline, including the introduction of a criminal offence for corporations that fail to take adequate steps to prevent the facilitation of tax evasion by those who act for them or on their behalf, including employees.</p>\n<p>“In our experience finance directors at best may have an awareness of this, but few are taking any steps to address the issue,” says Jon Claypole, a tax partner at Mazars.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"right\" ><span class=\"hide\">\"</span><p>Ensuring that the substance of the transaction is reflected and that the transaction is adequately disclosed are two key ingredients</p>\n<span class=\"hide\">\"</span></blockquote>\n<p>HMRC is already challenging finance directors when they feel teams are not sufficiently resourced, he adds, including cases of team members who process invoices and employee expenses claims without sufficient tax knowledge to do so correctly.</p>\n<p>Advisers and other facilitators are also coming under the spotlight. The proposed new enablers regime being introduced means HMRC now has the power to tackle anyone involved in the supply chain of tax avoidance schemes that have been challenged and defeated at a tribunal.</p>\n<p>“It’s all part of the same thing; a complete shutdown on anything they deem to be avoidance or tax planning schemes that are against the spirit of the law,” says Isobel Clift, manager at Blick Rothenberg. Penalties for enablers are based on the level of fees that have been charged in connection with the schemes, raising the possibility that HMRC may target schemes that have been used by large numbers of businesses or individuals, she adds.</p>\n<p>There is potential danger here for accountants too, warns Clift. “Accountancy firms have to be careful if they’re asked for second opinions about a particular scheme,” she says.</p>\n<p>“A lot of firms are considering developing some training on this in the same way that they have anti-bribery or anti-money laundering training, because while the penalties might not be too much of a burden, firms risk being named and shamed if tax is over a particular limit, and that’s something they will want to avoid at all cost.”</p>\n<p>There are also concerns over just who could be embroiled in any investigation. “Pretty much everyone in the supply chain, from IFAs and banks to lawyers and accountants, could be considered an enabler, so they have to ensure on a case-by-case basis that they are not classed as such in the relevant circumstances,” says Haydn Rogan, tax partner at Weightmans LLP. “This is a far from straightforward process. While the government has responded to some of these concerns by looking to limit the scope of the provisions, the measures remain broad and there will always be room for different interpretations.” HMRC, meanwhile, is already claiming an early victory, pointing to the decision by EDF Tax, a promoter of tax avoidance schemes, to close down, citing the enablers penalty as one reason.</p>\n<p>The recent Professional Conduct in Relation to Taxation (PCRT) code, which has been developed by seven professional bodies including ICAEW and came into force in March, also emphasises operating within the spirit of the law. While signing up to the code does not in itself constitute a defence against criminal liability, those who adhere to it are unlikely to find themselves at risk of unwanted investigations from HMRC. “It is having an effect; we’ve had a number of firms asking about it and expect that to continue,” says Haskew. “Members need to look at it carefully and reflect on what they are doing when giving tax advice.”</p>\n<p>There are other developments in the pipeline, too. Clift points to the requirement to correct period, which effectively gives firms or individuals with undeclared offshore tax until September 2018 to rectify the situation, including paying any tax due, or face penalties of up to 300% of the amount owing. A consultation around the requirement to notify offshore structures also recently closed, which is likely to lead to legislation further down the line.</p>\n<p>“It’s similar to the new enabler penalties that have come in; if you’re responsible for setting up arrangements which involve offshore structures and these have certain hallmarks, which we’re yet to have details on, then you’re obliged to notify HMRC of that particular arrangement and of any clients that have used this,” she says.</p>\n<p>But there is some concern that such a raft of measures could result in legislative overload, particularly for those in in-house finance departments who also have to contend with running the business. “Even professional advisers are struggling with all the material and what the differences are,” says Haskew. “There is a danger that people have difficulty in understanding what all these provisions are doing, and the question then is whether it will really address the problem. But if there was a magic bullet to try and stop all this, HMRC would have used it a long time ago.”</p>\n<div class=\"am_info_box\">\n\t<fieldset>\n\t<legend><div>CUTTING ITS CLOTH</div></legend>\n\t<div class=\"text\"><p class=\"noindent\">After years of job cuts and tax office closures, there will understandably be concerns over just how much resource HMRC has to devote to a tax avoidance crackdown. “HMRC’s resources are always being cut,” says Frank Haskew, head of tax at ICAEW. “To give it some credit, it is an organisation that is struggling with organisational changes and a constant reduction in headcount and resources. That’s a very challenging environment in which to work.”</p>\n<p>For its part, HMRC told economia it does have resources to focus on this area, and Isobel Clift, manager at Blick Rothenberg, also suggests that penalties have been made a priority area. “In recent years they have been putting their efforts into where they believe it’s needed, which is mostly into counteracting avoidance and evasion,” she says. “That’s not to say there’s not a resource issue, but it would be foolish to introduce all these changes without the manpower to back it up.”</p>\n<p>The organisation is also being helped by more effective use of IT and data, suggests Jon Claypole, a tax partner at Mazars. “It now has a powerful IT system, which can collate all the information it holds in one place and make it possible for a team of tax specialists to identify tax risks across all the heads of tax,” he says.</p>\n<p>“It is evident that the department is asking more pertinent questions too,” he adds. “The recruitment of qualified accountants means the challenges from HMRC also have an accounting angle and the quality of those questions is on many occasions impressive.” There is, however, a need to ensure that staff are trained in the commercial realities of being in business, as well as tax and accounting issues, he adds.</p>\n</div>\n\t</fieldset>\n</div>","layout":{"landscape":{"id":"am-dp1-layout15","link":"story-landscape-layout8.html"},"portrait":{"id":"am-dp1-layout16","link":"story-portrait-layout8.html"}},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":"","link_source":"","image":[{"id":"28f7e256e93622f37966ad58ed0dffe1","name":"Fair-play","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com/var/economia/storage/images/fair-play/124675-1-eng-GB/fair-play_story_img_size_768x929.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"768","height":"929","is_default":true},{"id":"28f7e256e93622f37966ad58ed0dffe1","name":"Fair-play","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com/var/economia/storage/images/fair-play/124675-1-eng-GB/fair-play_story_img_size_1024x673.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"1024","height":"673","is_default":false}],"url_alias":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com","type":"story","order":"22","folio_number":"","folio_numbers":"","pdf_page_index":"0","thumbnail":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com/var/economia/storage/images/fair-play/124675-1-eng-GB/fair-play_tablet_story_thumbnail.jpg","color":"ed1c24","real_id":"13720","main_section_id":"1290","ads":[]},{"id":"7e7e0d83bdb28b6f8636bb8c03fdb0aa","title":"Getting to grips with audit quality","sub_title":"","author":[{"id":"0","name":"Emily Black","email":"emily.black@progressivecp.com","is_default":false}],"tag":"","strap_line":"Audit quality","short_intro":"What is audit quality and do stakeholders really know how to judge it?","intro":"The accounting regulator is calling on firms to improve their audit quality control procedures. But what is audit quality and how do stakeholders know if a quality audit has been delivered? \r\nCaroline Biebuyck reports\r\n","body":"<p class=\"dropcap\">For the past four years the Financial Reporting Council (FRC) has been complementing its individual file reviews with a broader analysis of the world of audit, considering firm-specific issues at a number of the largest audit practices. The eighth of these thematic reviews, published earlier this year, looked at quality control policies and procedures, comparing these between firms and identifying areas of good practice.</p>\n<p>While many of the review’s conclusions were positive, one finding stood out: one-third of audits reviewed, it said, needed “more than just limited improvement”. Bearing in mind that the sample was of some of the largest audits in the country, this makes for stark reading.</p>\n<p>Or does it? The FRC’s remit is to look at whether firms have been complying with auditing standards. But the fact that its thematic reviews are designed to assess audit quality assumes that this compliance delivers quality. That assumption, many feel, is open to question.</p>\n<p>“Here we have a useful report from the FRC on what more could be done to control quality, but it doesn’t say much, if anything, about what drives quality in the first place,” says David Herbinet, </p>\n<p> UK head of PIE and global audit leader at Mazars. “The foundation of quality should be how you deliver quality first time, not how you control quality after the event.”</p>\n<p>This raises the question: how does a firm deliver a quality audit? This deceptively simple question throws up many different answers. Start with this one from Andrew Ratcliffe, a former PwC partner and ICAEW president (he still sits on Council) who is the audit committee chair at a couple of charities. “Audit quality is about delivering an appropriate professional opinion that’s independent, reliable, understandable, and is supported by adequate evidence and objective judgement,” he says.  </p>\n<p>The problem is the nature of the audit means that it’s not easy to measure its quality. Some use a negative proxy: an audit that gives a clean bill of health to a company that subsequently fails is a bad audit. Others equate quality with compliance. But quality and compliance are not synonyms, says Gill Spaul, technical director at Moore Stephens Europe.</p>\n<p>“You can have a fully compliant audit that isn’t necessarily the quality you want. And you can have an audit that isn’t completely compliant but that comes up with the right answer. Is that a good quality audit or a bad quality audit that got lucky?”</p>\n<p>This need for a more holistic view of audit quality runs through the profession. ICAEW’s Audit Quality Forum looks beyond standards and compliance to focus on issues such as having the right people with the right competencies, while in the US the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board has consulted on more quantitative measures of audit quality indicators.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"right\" ><span class=\"hide\">\"</span><p><b>Audit quality is about delivering an appropriate professional opinion that’s independent, reliable, understandable, and is supported by adequate evidence and objective judgement</b></p>\n<span class=\"hide\">\"</span></blockquote>\n<p class=\"noindent\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 class=\"noindent\"><b><b>FALSE CONCLUSIONS</b></b></h2><p class=\"noindent\">Quantitative measures don’t just run the risk of being too simplistic, says Chris Cantwell, technical practice regulation manager at ICAEW’s Audit and Assurance Faculty: their limitations might lead to false conclusions. “For instance, it might be seen as a good thing that there have been a lot of training hours at a firm. But that doesn’t tell you anything about the quality of the training or whether it’s the right sort of training. It might even indicate that there’s a deeper quality issue that will never be addressed by training.”</p>\n<p>Cantwell is not the only person to think that concentrating on measurables might be counterproductive. EY has been doing some work with cognitive behavioural psychologists looking at the patterns that drive a good quality audit. UK managing partner of assurance Hywel Ball says this has shown unintended consequences of some compliance activity, which can have a knock-on effect on the quality of the audit.</p>\n<p>“The audit team starts with worrying about being compliant rather than thinking about what the overall objective of the audit is and remembering that the big picture is to deliver a robust audit. We are trying to re-emphasise how important that aspect of the audit is. My belief is that the cultural and behavioural aspect is just as important, if not more so, than compliance. Getting the behavioural pattern right is crucial in addressing all the aspects of audit quality.”</p>\n<p>The focus on compliance means that firms tend to align themselves with the regulator’s view – a perspective that is not necessarily aligned or consistent with that of the market, thinks Herbinet. “My view, and I believe the market view, is the best way to define audit quality is to consider the relevance of the audit to the end service users. There is a significant expectation gap between what people want to receive and what firms actually deliver. One of the challenges, and the main reason why this debate is stalling, is that the market is not homogenous in terms of what it wants.”</p>\n<p>Hemione Hudson, PwC’s UK head of assurance, says that for investors, audit quality means getting robust financial information: “The ultimate measure of audit quality is the trust people have in the capital market.”</p>\n<p>One approach to measuring audit quality, she says, is to measure inputs and outputs. The former include having a robust methodology, and using the right people who are given the right training and have the appropriate industry exposure to understand the environment. “We also need to ask: are we using the right technology? There is a greater demand for data analytics to ensure we are evolving audit to cope with big data.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 class=\"noindent\"><b>NEW LEVEL</b></h2><p class=\"noindent\">Outputs include firms’ internal file reviews and the FRC Audit Quality Review (AQR) team’s assessment of public interest entity audit files. AQRs have pushed audits to a new level, says Next plc audit committee chair Steve Barber. “Quality has risen sharply as the auditor knows that at some point they will be subject to an external review,” he says.</p>\n<p>The FRC also reports on general developments in audit every six months. Since it started pulling these reports together, it has found that stakeholders close to the audit – such as the CFO and the audit committee chair – are becoming more confident about the audit. Investors, however, who have less interaction with the auditor, are less so.</p>\n<p>Why is this? “The FRC appreciates that quality is not just about compliance,” says Henry Irving, head of ICAEW’s Audit and Assurance Faculty. “It’s about service quality: the quality of the people who come before the audit committee and management; the quality of the insights made to those charged with the company’s governance.”</p>\n<p>The questions that Barber considers in assessing audit quality are: is the audit efficient and effective? “This comes down to good planning, good communication and reporting to the audit committee,” he says.</p>\n<p>The past few years have seen a huge change in the communication between the auditors and the audit committee. Where this was neither very formal nor structured in the past, Barber says the report to the audit committee is now extremely useful.</p>\n<p>“Some of the auditor’s report to the audit committee is too focused on independence and regulation: I understand why they are needed but they do add to the length. What I’m most interested in are the 10 pages or so that deal with the real issues. The audit committee members want to understand these and be comfortable that they are right or understand what the variables might be. These reports are now high quality and bring home the key messages.” </p>\n<p>Ratcliffe says the auditor’s reports are a good start in judging the quality of the audit. “These are much more useful now. With the new form of audit report to shareholders as well as the private report for the audit committee you can see the thought and analysis that has gone into risk areas and judge them on how well they have explored the issues. But you should also sit down and talk to the audit partner.</p>\n<p>On a larger assignment, I would like to talk to some of the team as well, to attend planning meetings and debrief meetings to get a more rounded sense of the team as a collective. This isn’t something you can reduce to a scorecard – it comes down to personal judgement.”</p>\n<p>Service interviews and questionnaires help management and the audit committee form a view on how rigorous the audit has been. Firms are sifting through plenty of interesting results from this feedback at the moment, given the numbers of audits that are changing hands due to the new audit rotation rules. In many cases, says Ball, management are saying they have been probed on areas that they have not been asked about for a while. “That’s not to say the previous audits were bad; rather that the principle of a fresh pair of eyes is coming into play.” </p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 class=\"noindent\"><b>POSITIVE NEGATIVES</b></h2><p class=\"noindent\">What’s more, negative feedback might have good implications for quality. Hudson recalls a recent experience at a new client in which 20 of 108 feedback forms received were from people who were not happy with the audit. “We discussed this with the audit committee and found the detractors were all from overseas locations where we had raised significant control issues. The audit committee were pleased: they pointed out our role was not to make people comfortable.” </p>\n<p>While definitions of audit quality may differ, there is one point most agree on: it does not stand still. People’s concept of what they expect audit quality to be evolves, says Spaul.</p>\n<p>“This is partly because standards change, partly because circumstances change, and the way in which we are able to access and manipulate information changes. There are new ways in which companies are structured and business is conducted. Audit has to evolve to match what is being audited. And as audit evolves, so does the concept of what good quality means.”</p>\n<p>ICAEW is working towards constant improvement in audit quality and doing long-term work with its Audit Futures programme to train audit professionals for the future, says Irving. He points out that there is and always will be a short-form for quality: brand. “Auditors are effectively lending their brand to their clients. If the brand is no good, as in the Andersen case, you lose business pretty quickly. Ultimately, it’s all about trust.”</p>\n","layout":{"landscape":{"id":"am-dp1-layout17","link":"story-landscape-layout9.html"},"portrait":{"id":"am-dp1-layout18","link":"story-portrait-layout9.html"}},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":"","link_source":"","image":[{"id":"82fbe588e93b1df5b8ccef1fac16f35f","name":"Audit-quality","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com/var/economia/storage/images/audit-quality/124700-1-eng-GB/audit-quality_story_img_size_768x929.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"768","height":"929","is_default":true},{"id":"82fbe588e93b1df5b8ccef1fac16f35f","name":"Audit-quality","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com/var/economia/storage/images/audit-quality/124700-1-eng-GB/audit-quality_story_img_size_1024x673.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"1024","height":"673","is_default":false}],"url_alias":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com","type":"story","order":"23","folio_number":"","folio_numbers":"","pdf_page_index":"0","thumbnail":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com/var/economia/storage/images/audit-quality/124700-1-eng-GB/audit-quality_tablet_story_thumbnail.jpg","color":"ed1c24","real_id":"13723","main_section_id":"1290","ads":[]},{"id":"ae7d4f747d3189f92130defe6d04ec9e","title":"A day in the life","sub_title":"","author":[{"id":"0","name":"Emily Black","email":"emily.black@progressivecp.com","is_default":false}],"tag":"","strap_line":"A day in the life","short_intro":"Liz Carnie, finance director at Chester Zoo","intro":"Liz Carnie, finance director at Chester Zoo, tells Raymond Doherty how her working days are filled with animal magic","body":"<h2 class=\"noindent\"><b>HOW I CHANGED CAREER</b></h2><p class=\"noindent\">There’s a picture of me at four years old with a Chester Zoo cap on by the sea lion pool. As a child I visited many times, during school trips and with my family. We had 1.9 million visitors last year so it makes a huge contribution to the local economy. I saw the job come up and applied straight away.</p>\n<p>It was a shock coming from a demanding corporate environment. The first few days I couldn’t work out why everyone was smiling at me. I’ve worked out now it’s because they love working here.</p>\n<p>Before I came here I wouldn’t say I was a massive animal person (I had a cat) and not that interested in conservation, but when you get here and get involved, it draws you in. I probably spend more time watching nature documentaries now than my husband appreciates. He did call me an animal geek the other day.</p>\n<p>Some days it is all hands on deck, like in the run-up to the opening of our Islands project (a £40m programme to recreate the exotic isles of south-east Asia), and some days you can watch a baby giraffe being born on CCTV, which is just amazing. You can get involved in the minutiae of marketing campaigns, and then one of the elephants will have a baby and everyone stops and thinks, that’s just the most marvellous thing. But it can go the other way as well. A couple of years ago we lost two of our elephants due to a herpes virus. It’s horrible. The whole mood around the place just drops. But on the back of it we are fundraising for research into finding a cure. You can see where the money we generate goes, not just keeping the zoo ticking over.</p>\n<p>I enjoy engaging with the visitors when walking around. They usually just want to know directions to the orangutans or something but it’s good to chat about their day and what they’ve been enjoying. Then someone will walk around the corner and come towards you with a bucket of leeches. </p>\n\n<div class=\"object-left\"><div class=\"hide gallery\">\n<ul><li>3cc600857f6c43c4be0bf678c2a79c0b</li><li>7b9845c81e0f04d3df06d3ace716ffaf</li><li>caa0b4356b1aab905360ed47e2798129</li><li>2aec276b69688e6b50d3102abc750cf1</li><li>6fdecd39d965959d932809dfcbfd1641</li><li>83c535feac430d760e5880b626e93abd</li><li>22e852738eac47edbc360ee0ceb79dcc</li><li>e981cef61c001d36ccd19ec9119b8c24</li></ul>\n</div></div><h2 class=\"noindent\"><b>MY RESPONSIBILITIES</b></h2><p class=\"noindent\">I’m primarily responsible for finance and IT. I have a team of around 35 people. I spend a lot of time looking at budgets, forecasts and capital expenditure. Over this winter alone we will have spent around £10m on capital projects, £7m of it animal related. We’re currently working on our 15-year development plan for the estate and zoo.</p>\n<p>We’re a charity, governed by a board of trustees who oversee what we’re doing and we have an executive board I sit on. We’re totally reliant on visitors. We’ve got 90,000 members who have an annual pass. It’s a very collaborative place to work. I’m responsible for finance and we’re constantly involved in projects that involve different teams. It is very broad. There are over 30 departments – we’ve got vets, marketing, social scientists, retail, catering, maintenance, lots of contractors. It’s like a small town, really.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"right\" ><span class=\"hide\">\"</span><p><b>I couldn’t work out why everyone was smiling at me. I’ve worked out now it’s because they love working here</b></p>\n<span class=\"hide\">\"</span></blockquote>\n<h2 class=\"noindent\"><b><b>MY TYPICAL DAY</b></b></h2><p class=\"noindent\">The alarm goes off at 6am. I work four days a week – I have a child at nursery so I try to get everything organised for her. We leave at around 7.30am. First thing I do when I get in is check the weather and visitor number forecasts. My day can vary quite a bit. It could be very formal with one of our board of trustees meetings. That will mean lots of presentations, strategy issues, discussion around projects. Some days I’ll spend talking to the FDs of other charitable zoos. Some days it’s reviewing payroll or accounts or work with the marketing team or IT. On others it’s wearing a hard hat and wellies on a building site. I finish around 5pm and dash home to get my daughter. She’s just at the age where she’s getting interested in the zoo. Although I did ask her what mummy does at the zoo and she said: “Drives a bus.”</p>\n<h2 class=\"noindent\"><b>THE CHALLENGES I'VE OVERCOME</b></h2><p class=\"noindent\">Keeping up with growth. We’ve grown quite significantly over the last five years. We have a very dynamic team who have lots of ideas and want to try new things. It’s about making sure our systems can cope. There are a lot of very clever people here but few have a financial background. I have a minor obsession with weather as it effects the number of people who come through the gates. But we have put a lot of work into attracting people to come here out of season with things like our Winter Walk. We focus on improving our income stream year-round so we don’t have huge seasonal peaks and troughs. We are open 363 days a year. We have had The Secret Life of The Zoo series on Channel 4, which has been very successful. They’re yet to do a finance special on VAT partial exemption, but you never know!</p>\n<blockquote class=\"right\" ><span class=\"hide\">\"</span><p><b>Some days it’s reviewing payroll or accounts or marketing work.

We have some interesting debates around Brexit. It may make people stay home, it may bring us more visitors from overseas. It may pose some challenges in terms of staff. It may have some impact on our ability to move some animals between different countries. A question I often get asked is: “How much do you pay for animals? What’s the value on the balance sheet and how do you depreciate them?” We don’t buy animals. Most of our animals are part of European or worldwide breeding programmes. For each different species there will be a co-ordinator across zoos who will decide where the animals can move to for breeding purposes. So Brexit could increase the amount of regulation we have to consider.</p>\n<h2 class=\"noindent\"><b>HOW THE ACA HELPED MY CAREER</b></h2><p class=\"noindent\">It makes you think. I trained as an auditor, which makes you probe and consider possibilities. It gives you a very good technical grounding. It’s been a long time since I’ve had my head in the books but if someone brings me a proposal I can still do it. It also gives you a feel for when things don’t look right. Starting at PwC also gave me exposure to people at board level at an early stage of my career.</p>\n<h2 class=\"noindent\"><b>THE HABITS OF AN ACCOUNTANT</b></h2><p class=\"noindent\">We drink a lot of tea. We’re fairly organised. I love a to-do list. We probably have a reputation for being miserable, the ones who say no.

third of qualified accountants say they plan to change jobs next year. So how can you make sure you hang on to your best staff? Rachel Willcox outlines a retention strategy","body":"<p class=\"dropcap\">Your business is only as good as the people you employ, so it’s no wonder that recruiting good staff has long been high up the list of major business priorities. But more recently the challenge of retaining them has cranked up a notch, as the gig economy becomes a reality and the concept of employee loyalty – particularly among the most recent generation of recruits – becomes increasingly rare.</p>\n<p>Social networks mean the time and effort of changing jobs is no longer the barrier it once was. The latest Pay and Bonus survey from recruiter Robert Walters warns that a third of accounting and finance professionals are actively searching for a new job, while a further 29% plan to change jobs in the next year. A similar survey, from the Global Accounting Network, suggests that 61% of UK-based qualified accountants plan on moving on in the next two years.</p>\n<p>A certain level of employee churn is necessary for a business, freeing up career ladder-climbing opportunities for ambitious internal candidates and allowing you to inject all-important fresh blood into the fold. However, too much churn is damaging for morale, costly and disruptive. It’s about striking a balance, and yet all too many businesses are missing a trick when it comes to simple strategies for keeping existing high flyers happy, motivated and performing at their best. </p>\n<h2 class=\"noindent\"><b>NURTURE THEIR INITIATIVE</b></h2><p class=\"noindent\">Any good employee will leave a workplace that stifles their initiative and gives them too little responsibility. Generation Y employees are much more reluctant to accept the hierarchy, layers and processes that limit their capacity to do things in their own way.</p>\n<p>The best people want more of an equal relationship, says Isaac Getz, professor at business school ESCP Europe and author of the bestselling management book Freedom Inc. “Treat employees as responsible adults who can be trusted with their own initiative. When an employee brings up a problem or opportunity never tell them what to do, instead say, ‘You are in charge of this. I trust if you take a bit of time, you’ll find a solution’.”</p>\n<p>Have outcome-based goals and be explicit about how individuals’ goals link to the bigger picture at all levels of the business. “We want people to think it’s their business and that they have a responsibility to support the business to grow,” says Jenn Barnett, head of people experience at Grant Thornton UK.</p>\n<h2 class=\"noindent\"><b>DON'T LEAVE PEOPLE MANAGEMENT TO CHANCE</b></h2><p class=\"noindent\">People join great organisations but leave bad managers; the quality of leadership is the biggest factor influencing staff motivation. “Companies that have higher levels of engagement are better performing, and do better at retaining staff,” says Kevin Murray, author of People With Purpose.</p>\n<p>Make sure that anyone promoted into a people management role has the right skills, and if not, develop them. “People managers need emotional intelligence,” says Lucy Whitehall, a wellbeing expert at CABA. “It’s about respect and connection, being optimistic, empathic and hopeful.” To drive engagement, managers need to be good listeners and conversationalists.</p>\n<p>“Good managers set clear goals, offer constructive feedback, make people feel valued and involve them in decision making,” says Ian Feaver, European director of employee recognition specialist OC Tanner. Getting line managers to think about the risk and implications of staff leaving allows them to focus on strategies to make top performers feel valued, Feaver adds.</p>\n<h2 class=\"noindent\"><b>GIVE THEM OPPORTUNITIES TO GROW AND SKILLS TO LEAVE</b></h2><p class=\"noindent\">Good people don’t leave their careers to chance. They are ambitious and know where they are heading. Have a clear personal development programme in place and empower individuals to drive their own careers.</p>\n<p>“The talent pool is getting smaller. More open-minded organisations are being creative and moulding roles around people with potential rather than experience,” says Susy Roberts, founder of people management consultancy Hunter Roberts. “Help people play to their strengths rather than focusing on what they don’t do well, and support them accordingly.” Give people choice and ownership about how they develop, whether it’s formal training courses, interactive learning or coaching, Roberts adds.</p>\n<h2 class=\"noindent\"><b>DON'T LIMIT FEEDBACK TO AN ANNUAL APPRAISAL</b></h2><p class=\"noindent\">In contrast to the annual appraisal, which many staff regard as an opportunity for their boss to tell them what they’re doing wrong, timely and ongoing feedback makes them feel valued and helps them to constantly adapt to whatever opportunities are available.</p>\n<p>Confidence-building feedback is a gift rather than a negative; see it as ongoing coaching for staff who want to leverage your experience. “It’s about development, not performance,” says Karen Hochrein, EY Global Assurance talent leader.</p>\n<h2 class=\"noindent\"><b>REALLY GET TO KNOW YOUR PEOPLE</b></h2><p class=\"noindent\">Naming five key team members isn’t hard. But would you know the names of their partners, their family circumstances and the things they do outside of work? What are their career aspirations and previous roles? “How can you possibly help to keep people engaged if you know nothing about them?” asks Dominic Irvine, founder of leadership and management consultancy Epiphanies.</p>\n<p>To retain great people, understand what makes them tick, Irvine advises. Think about how you can help them progress in their career and be aware of the context in which they are working. “Reporting to someone who gives a damn, who is helping you succeed and who is empathic to your personal circumstances is not someone most people would want to leave in a hurry to work somewhere else.”</p>\n<h2 class=\"noindent\"><b>CONSTANTLY RE-RECRUIT YOUR TOP PERFORMERS</b></h2><p class=\"noindent\">Identify your top performers – the staff you’d be really lost without – and recognise that they need constant stimulation. “Typically these people will need a new challenge at least every 18 months, so head them off the path,” says CABA’s Whitehall. “Be honest with them, say you don’t want to lose them and ask what you can do to keep them.”</p>\n<p>The answer may lie in mentoring or a sideways move, the opportunity to lead a project or come up with a new idea for the business. “It’s about giving people that same feeling of excitement they got when they first joined,” Whitehall adds.</p>\n<p>Grant Thornton’s aim is to have 25% of available roles filled by internal candidates. “We actively target high performers and encourage that mobility. With flatter structures you can’t necessarily offer promotions to keep people,” Barnett says. “People don’t necessarily want more responsibility but they might want a different experience.”</p>\n<h2 class=\"noindent\"><b>MAKE SURE YOUR STAFF ROOM MATCHES THE SHOP FRONT</b></h2><p class=\"noindent\">Don’t recruit turnover, warns Stephen Bevan, head of HR research development at the Institute for Employment Studies. “If you create a high expectation – for example by over-promising work-life balance, career progression, and training and development – it will attract people, but if you don’t deliver they will leave. You need to be brave and authentic enough to say, this is the reality of the situation.”</p>\n<p>The greater the dissonance between the external brand and the internal brand, the less likely you will be to retain the best people. “Stand by the sell that you used to entice them into your company and make sure that you deliver on the career progression that you promised,” says Kyra Cordrey, a director of recruiter Michael Page Finance &amp; Consultancy. </p>\n<h2 class=\"noindent\"><b>BUILD TRUSTING RELATIONSHIPS</b></h2><p class=\"noindent\">Understand each other’s drivers, motivations and preferences to build trust from the very start of your working relationship, says Nigel Purse, director at The Oxford Group. “It means employees are more likely to confide in their manager about any issues, rather than suffer in silence and leave the company because they are unhappy with how things are.”</p>\n<p>Open discussions about expectations, purpose-build mutual accountability for success and contribute towards the end goal of forging a trusting relationship. “Employees are less likely to feel solely responsible for the inevitable pinch points and won’t feel like they are being taken advantage of while other team members are not pulling their weight,” says Purse.</p>\n<h2 class=\"noindent\"><b>TELL THEM HOW THEY ADD VALUE AND SHOW THEM GENUINE APPRECIATION</b></h2><p class=\"noindent\">Having a purpose in life puts a spring in your step, a buzz in your soul and enthusiasm in your work. “One of the most important things is to keep people feeling involved in what’s going on in the workplace and how they can contribute, and then making them feel as if their contribution is valued,” says Sara Burks at Adaptis. “People perform when they feel good about themselves.”</p>\n<p>If employees do something that is culturally relevant, thank them and do it publicly if they are happy with that, Feaver suggests. And when an individual or a team achieves a great result or does a great piece of work, reward them with something tangible. “Celebrate careers and call out publicly how valuable staff are to the business at certain points in their career – make a presentation and say something positive that aligns their achievements with the values of the business. It will also motivate other staff and help to build trust.”</p>\n<p>Grant Thornton says its Shared Enterprise Model is about fairness and encouraging transparency about how their business is performing and allowing staff to share in the rewards. “It’s about encouraging the employee voice,” says Barnett.</p>\n<h2 class=\"noindent\"><b>GOODBYE FLEXIBLE WORKING, HELLO DYNAMIC/AGILE WORKING</b></h2><p class=\"noindent\">These days, flexibility in the way staff work is much more than a nice-to-have – it’s a deal breaker. Dynamic working is more than flexible working. “It’s having more of a high-trust, high performance work culture,” explains Cordrey.</p>\n<p>“If you have more autonomy and you’re more in control it gives you a boost of confidence and makes you happier,” says Ian MacRae, the author of Motivation and Performance. Also have senior role models who visibly work flexibly.</p>\n<p>It has to be a real commitment to offering agility about where and when they work. “This is about outcomes-based results and showing we trust our people to do the right thing and to do good work for our clients,” says Barnett. </p>\n","layout":{"landscape":{"id":"am-dp1-layout7","link":"story-landscape-layout4.html"},"portrait":{"id":"am-dp1-layout8","link":"story-portrait-layout4.html"}},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":"","link_source":"","image":[{"id":"23750c6b602ace97e12891f4f5d48ceb","name":"Careers","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com/var/economia/storage/images/careers2/124883-1-eng-GB/careers_story_img_size_768x929.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"768","height":"929","is_default":true},{"id":"23750c6b602ace97e12891f4f5d48ceb","name":"Careers","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com/var/economia/storage/images/careers2/124883-1-eng-GB/careers_story_img_size_1024x673.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"1024","height":"673","is_default":false}],"url_alias":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com","type":"story","order":"25","folio_number":"","folio_numbers":"","pdf_page_index":"0","thumbnail":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com/var/economia/storage/images/careers2/124883-1-eng-GB/careers_tablet_story_thumbnail.jpg","color":"ed1c24","real_id":"13748","main_section_id":"1290","ads":[]},{"id":"b7411319580036cb0e88725b2613b34a","title":"Adam Crozier","sub_title":"","author":[{"id":"0","name":"Emily Black","email":"emily.black@progressivecp.com","is_default":false}],"tag":"","strap_line":"Career ladder","short_intro":"","intro":"We look at the key moves of this successful serial director","body":"<p class=\"noindent\"><b>1964:</b> Born, Scotland.

Or the prime minister? Just to be clear, I am not making the point that CFOs shouldn’t be <br /> held to that level of accountability. More that the same isn’t expected of the people who are bidding to be in control of our lives and national destinies.</p>\n<p>The only thing someone starting in their career in the finance function has to offer the market is their guarantee of honesty and integrity. As you develop so do your skills – but while they can wax and wane the above guarantee must not.</p>\n<p>Compare the reactions to driving around the country with a lie on a bus, or announcing that there would be an emergency Budget post-Brexit, with the reaction to a CFO who stood up and announced they would quadruple earnings and within months said “what – you believed me?”. They would be out of the business faster than someone could call me to find a replacement.</p>\n<p>That CFOs are held to greater levels of accountability than politicians is sadly true. And it is vital that the finance community recognise and embrace this. Because whatever the leaders of the free world can get away with, you can’t. Our pensions are invested in many of your businesses and people sell and buy your shares on the basis of the information the finance function produces.</p>\n<p>So of course it’s right that the world should expect accurate and truthful financial information.</p>\n<p>If you really could promise to deliver quadrupled earnings next year and then laugh when you don’t, the world would be in a serious mess. I’ll leave you to fill in the punchline.But that also means that if you promise one thing and don’t deliver it you have a substantial issue. Because for the same reason that if you saw another bus with a slogan on it you might not believe it so readily, if you are a CFO who isn’t trusted you simply can’t do your job any longer. </p>\n<p>And that leads in a roundabout way to my central point. Your ability to predict future performance against a backdrop in which decisions have a global impact is as challenging now as I have seen at any time. If not more challenging. Yet the market expects you to be as precise as you would be in calm, benign times. And whacks you harder if you miss the numbers you tried to predict six to 12 months earlier.</p>\n<p>Those two facts pose a conundrum, and it’s one the finance community is working ever harder to answer. And the answer may well be that if you can’t predict the number, don’t promise it.</p>\n","layout":{"landscape":{"id":"am-dp1-layout13","link":"story-landscape-layout7.html"},"portrait":{"id":"am-dp1-layout14","link":"story-portrait-layout7.html"}},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":"","link_source":"","image":[{"id":"309897438c82a08ae86e9880f0dcee14","name":"CAREER CLINIC","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com/var/economia/storage/images/career-clinic41/124933-1-eng-GB/career-clinic_story_img_size_768x929.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"768","height":"929","is_default":true},{"id":"309897438c82a08ae86e9880f0dcee14","name":"CAREER CLINIC","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com/var/economia/storage/images/career-clinic41/124933-1-eng-GB/career-clinic_story_img_size_1024x673.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"1024","height":"673","is_default":false}],"url_alias":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com","type":"story","order":"27","folio_number":"","folio_numbers":"","pdf_page_index":"0","thumbnail":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com/var/economia/storage/images/career-clinic41/124933-1-eng-GB/career-clinic_tablet_story_thumbnail.jpg","color":"ed1c24","real_id":"13754","main_section_id":"1290","ads":[]},{"id":"637a16905585d010a1c328453a1f693d","title":"Keeping his cool","sub_title":"","author":[{"id":"0","name":"Emily Black","email":"emily.black@progressivecp.com","is_default":false}],"tag":"","strap_line":"The ACA","short_intro":"","intro":"Nick Parker has taken mountains, oceans and the Arctic Circle in his stride.

He is not one of life’s observers: he likes to get stuck in. “I am passionate about things,” he says, “and I love what I do.”</p>\n<p>When he discovered accountancy, business and, later, tax, he knew he had found what he wanted to do with his life. “It was a light bulb moment and one that I owe to my father, who was also my headmaster. He persuaded Ealing Technical College to give me a chance after I had messed up my A-levels. I did my foundation course there and it was a complete revelation. I absolutely loved accountancy and from then on I never looked back.”</p>\n<p>For him the profession is as much about interacting with clients – particularly family businesses where he has advised three different generations during his career – as dealing with the commercial side. His proudest moment has been the consensus achieved last year between seven normally competitive tax and accountancy bodies over PCRT (Professional Conduct in Relation to Tax). That came after former chief secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander introduced the idea of a new strict liability criminal offence for offshore tax evasion, and called on the tax and accountancy regulatory bodies to maximise their role in policing the profession by setting and enforcing clear standards around the promotion of both tax evasion and tax avoidance.</p>\n<p>“When we went to see David Gauke after the Conservatives gained full power,” Parker recalls, “we asked him if it was something he would be parking and ignoring as it was Coalition policy.</p>\n<p>He told us that unless we did something, the government would consider regulation. I am very proud we got agreement on something that we believe has satisfied government but hasn’t impeded our membership.</p>\n<p>“It’s better that we work together,” he says. “We can debate the issues.” The same applies to ICAEW’s relationship with government ministers. </p>\n<p>Being a tax practitioner, it’s not surprising that tax is one of the two themes for his presidential year. He believes it has the potential to be “a real Achilles heel” for the profession given the emphasis the government is placing on stamping out tax avoidance. “So much is changing and if one of our members does something that is not quite right, the risk of reputational damage is enormous.” So PCRT is still high on the agenda. With the support of government, the bodies are now working on simplifying the 58-page document (which Parker describes as “a jumble”) to make it more understandable and to clarify where the rules end and the guidance begins.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"left\" ><span class=\"hide\">\"</span><p>So much is changing and if one of our members does something that is not quite right, the risk of reputational damage is enormous</p>\n<span class=\"hide\">\"</span></blockquote>\n<p>Another passion is diversity. He’s been chairing the ICAEW diversity advisory group since it was set up last July to ensure that the profession of the future reflects the current make-up of UK society. “There’s nothing we can do with our membership statistics,” he says. “What we can do is look at our student intake to make sure we are attracting as diverse a population as we can.</p>\n<p>“We are doing pretty well with student intake gender: it is currently 58% male, 42% female. Clearly that should be 50/50 and we are doing a lot of work on encouraging women to come into the profession. As far as ethnicity is concerned, our stats are pretty good. Our Asian intake is beyond the national statistics. The real problem is how to attract more black students. We are up against the perception that accountancy equals bookkeeping.” He says the issue is not confined to ICAEW but to the accountancy profession in general. “The large firms have some fantastic initiatives – as do we – to try to encourage black students to join the profession and we are making inroads, but not fast enough.”</p>\n<p>So over the next 12 months, expect lots of energy, enthusiasm and interesting projects. </p>\n<p>This is the man, after all, who signed up to do the Sydney to Cape Town leg of the Global Challenge (sailing round the world the “wrong way”) and ended up becoming involved in the crew’s management, storing their equipment in his stables and flying out to every place they stopped. “I wanted to be involved with the whole crew, not just get on at Sydney not knowing people and get off at Cape Town having just shared an experience with them.” As a result, the crew used him as a mediator: “When you are locked on a 70ft yacht for 38 days in not very nice conditions, tempers do get a little frayed. I would chair sessions to try to get the group back together.”</p>\n<p>His ability to keep his cool has also seen him acquire a private pilot’s licence (now ceased because of lack of time), trek to Everest Base Camp, climb Mounts Meru and Aconcagua (atrocious weather stopped him summiting), and go husky sledging in the Arctic Circle. And there are still plenty of adventures he’d like to tackle. “What’s next?” he laughs. “My presidential year, of course.”</p>\n<div class=\"am_info_box\">\n\t<fieldset>\n\t<legend><div>THE ACCOUNTANT</div></legend>\n\t<div class=\"text\"><p class=\"noindent\"><b>THE ACCOUNT</b></p>\n<p class=\"noindent\"><b>I love being an ACA because</b>… it has given me endless opportunities both professionally and personally.</p>\n<p class=\"noindent\"><b>I’m happiest when</b>… I’m travelling to new places.</p>\n<p class=\"noindent\"><b>My favourite book is</b>...

The solution? Greater education, says Ed Adshead-Grant, General Manager, Payments at Bottomline","body":"<p class=\"dropcap\">When the Faster Payments Service was launched in 2008, its central purpose was simple: to enable money transfers at close to the touch of a button, ramping down payment times considerably.</p>\n<p>Yet, approaching nine years since its introduction, adoption rates of the initiative for corporates can best be described as mixed.</p>\n<p>This was underscored in Bottomline Technologies’ second UK Business Payments Barometer report, in which 44% of financial decision-makers surveyed claimed their business had adopted the service; 41% said they hadn’t, while the rest of the respondents were not sure if it was even in place.</p>\n<p>Notably, of those shunning adoption, 53% said their main reason was that they had no need for faster real-time payments.</p>\n<p>“I think it has a lot to do with the DNA in some account departments that making faster outbound payments is a bad thing for cash flow,” explains Ed Adshead-Grant, General Manager, Payments at Bottomline.</p>\n<p>“But underneath it’s a different story in terms of customer service, reconciliation, and visibility around cash management. And even if you use Faster Payments, you can still schedule and diarise payments to best fit your needs.”</p>\n<p>According to Adshead-Grant, such confusion only serves to highlight the need for greater education for finance departments if they are to take full advantage of the industry investments. The same goes for regulations such as the proposed Payment System Regulator (PSR) changes, the introduction of Open Banking in the UK and the Payment Systems Directive II (PSD2).</p>\n<p>Despite their potential to significantly impact on the payments industry, they were listed by respondents in the latest Bottomline survey as some of the least prevalent change drivers in the next 12 months.</p>\n<p>“There is an opportunity to take massive advantage of regulatory change, but I think the perception around compliance is quite negative. People tend to ask whether they really need to do this stuff,” he says.</p>\n<p>“But beyond all those acronyms, proactive corporates have the chance to gain real-time access to multiple accounts, which can only make their decision-making even sharper and better. This comes down to education, and asking how these rules fit in with better, tighter, more secure treasury operations.”</p>\n<p>Does a slow adoption of Faster Payments and lukewarm reception of new rules suggest the payments industry is in danger of falling out of step with a rapidly changing economy? Adshead-Grant agrees that the sector needs to catch up with the rise of the gig economy – defined by flexible, short-term and unpredictable payments.</p>\n<p>“Despite the rise of digitisation and the Internet of Things, some payment infrastructures date back to the 1960s,” he says.</p>\n<p>“Society expects payments to be real-time and flexible. The back office is still a bit rusty when it comes to this, despite the front office being all shiny and modern. This disconnect of decades needs to be bridged.”</p>\n<p>Adshead-Grant’s extra takeaway message to decision-makers looking to navigate through the changing payments landscape is: Don’t lose sight of security.</p>\n<p>“Even though we are talking about redefining the back-end and ensuring it’s fit for purpose for a competitive, modern economy, security is so important,” he says.</p>\n<p>“Whether you’re looking at Faster Payments or regulatory impact, you have to keep an eye on the security and the integrity of the payments as the world changes. All payment systems need to be trusted and secure, otherwise money and corporate reputation can be at risk.”</p>\n<p class=\"callaction\"><b>For more information, please visit: bottomline.com/uk/payments-barometer</b></p>\n","layout":{"landscape":{"id":"am-dp1-layout1","link":"story-landscape-layout1.html"},"portrait":{"id":"am-dp1-layout2","link":"story-portrait-layout1.html"}},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":"","link_source":"","image":[{"id":"90112812c03b55c46af34e65fe39c3bf","name":"bottomline","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com/var/economia/storage/images/bottomline2/124983-1-eng-GB/bottomline_story_img_size_708x430.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"708","height":"430","is_default":true},{"id":"90112812c03b55c46af34e65fe39c3bf","name":"bottomline","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com/var/economia/storage/images/bottomline2/124983-1-eng-GB/bottomline_story_img_size_472x478.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"472","height":"478","is_default":false}],"url_alias":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com","type":"story","order":"29","folio_number":"","folio_numbers":"","pdf_page_index":"0","thumbnail":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com/var/economia/storage/images/bottomline2/124983-1-eng-GB/bottomline_tablet_story_thumbnail.jpg","color":"ed1c24","real_id":"13760","main_section_id":"1290","ads":[]},{"id":"b0abad8bf15146f2eb1334707c9e3af7","title":"Securing an extra decade of comfortable returns","sub_title":"","author":[{"id":"0","name":"Emily Black","email":"emily.black@progressivecp.com","is_default":false}],"tag":"","strap_line":"Sponsored feature: Netwealth","short_intro":"","intro":"Rising life expectancy and low interest rates are stirring up a perfect storm for investors – but a few smart decisions could generate a sustainable income for an extra 10 years or more in later life","body":"<p class=\"dropcap\">One smart move open to investors is to choose an investment vehicle whose costs will eat up less of their income. According to data from Numis Securities, the average UK wealth manager charges 1.8% a year. The lower fees offered by some challenger brands could considerably extend the life of a pension pot.</p>\n<p>Research by Netwealth shows that an investor aged 65 with a portfolio valued at £650,000 who chose to draw down £35,000 a year should expect to see their money last 24 years. But by selecting a more modern wealth management service, with all-in annual fees of around 0.8%, the money should last for 28 years.</p>\n<p>Investors who start earlier could achieve an even longer retirement in comfort. For instance, a saver who invests a £250,000 pot at age 45, goes on to contribute a total of £700 gross a month until age 65 and then retires with an income of £35,000 a year, should expect the money to last 24 years with a traditional wealth manager. By using a more cost-effective, modern investment manager, however, they should secure their income for 40 years – an additional 16 years of income.</p>\n<p>For an inexperienced investor, while the difference in annual charges might appear to be relatively small, it’s quite an eye-opener to realise it could provide them with an extra 10 years or more of comfortable retirement.</p>\n<p>Challenger investment services, such as Netwealth, are able to keep costs down by combining the services of qualified advisers and experienced investment managers with modern technology. Netwealth dispenses with the extraneous aspects of a traditional service such as wood-panelled rooms, banks of salespeople and golf days, which drive up costs to the detriment of the end investor.</p>\n<p>The effect of low charges could be even more powerful if used with other strategies for sustainable saving. An investor could choose to draw down a little less income every year, or to adjust drawdown regularly to reflect the changing value of the pension pot.</p>\n<p>Netwealth also recommends that investors ask their wealth manager for the full details on fees – since often the all-in total cost is not fully disclosed – as well as understanding where their money is being invested. This includes looking at how diversified the investments are and ensuring the level of risk is appropriate to an individual’s financial goals.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"noindent\"><b>MORE ABOUT NETWEALTH</b></p>\n<p class=\"noindent\">Seasoned leadership team: We bring a very significant level of maturity and know-how to wealth management.</p>\n<p class=\"noindent\">Cost effective: Netwealth makes use of the latest technology, allowing the total fee charges to be between a quarter to one third that of the industry average.</p>\n<p class=\"noindent\">Comprehensive offering: Our powerful investment tools help you to plan for a variety of financial goals, including regular income, significant outgoings and pension drawdown.
