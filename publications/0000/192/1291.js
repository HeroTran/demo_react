Bank Regulatory Ratios: ICAEW Assurance Framework is applicable to all regulatory ratios, including capital, liquidity and leverage, and is intended to deliver confidence in the key measures of resilience. It is also applicable to other businesses facing prudential regulation, such as investment firms, and can be applied worldwide.</p>\n<p>The framework sets out a number of overarching principles for providing robust assurance while allowing flexibility to apply it to most risk types whether operational, credit or liquidity risk.</p>\n<p class=\"noindent\"><a href=\"http://icaew.com/assuranceframework\" target=\"_self\">icaew.com/assuranceframework</a></p>\n<p class=\"noindent\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"noindent\"><b>AUDITORS AND PRELIMINARY ANNOUNCEMENTS</b></p>\n<p class=\"noindent\">The Financial Reporting Council (FRC) has issued a discussion paper about the use and value of preliminary announcements in the UK and the role of the auditor in relation to them, as part of the revision of its current auditor guidance.</p>\n<p>Preliminary results are usually based on audited information, although a minority of companies do publish preliminaries based on unaudited information. Some listed entities have been moving towards the simultaneous publication of annual results in “preliminary” form alongside the statutory financial statements.</p>\n<p>The FRC has discovered through its stakeholder engagement that there appears to be “limited understanding” of the auditor’s current role when agreeing to the publication of preliminaries. As a result, it has identified a range of options to provide greater clarity. One proposed option requires audits to be complete and the auditor’s report on the underpinning statutory financial statements to be signed before preliminary results can be released. The FRC is keen to hear from respondents with suggestions of other innovative ideas or emerging practice.</p>\n<p>Deadline for comments is 23 June 2017.</p>\n<p class=\"noindent\"><a href=\"http://frc.org.uk\" target=\"_self\">frc.org.uk</a></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"noindent\"><b>CHARITY AUDITORS' AND EXAMINERS' GUIDANCE</b></p>\n<p class=\"noindent\">The three charity regulators (England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland) have come up with revised joint guidance for auditors and independent examiners on reporting matters of material significance. They have added two new areas of reporting to the list of matters of material significance. The first covers when an auditor has concerns about a charity’s accounts and issues a modified audit opinion report or qualified independent examiner’s report. The second covers when an auditor has concerns that conflicts of interest or related party transactions have not been properly managed or declared.</p>\n<p>The three have also removed one matter from the list, which had led to auditors and independent examiners telling the regulators when they had simply ceased to hold office. When there are reportable matters involved in their resignation, this is covered by an alternative matter.</p>\n<p>Commenting on the revised guidance, Nigel Davies, head of accountancy services at the Charity Commission for England and Wales, said that it has become clear that not all auditors and examiners had been reporting matters to the regulators. “We hope that by providing an updated list auditors and examiners may be clearer in their duties. We urge auditors and examiners to read this updated list of matters which has been informed by our regulatory work to report and continue to report these serious issues to the regulators.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"noindent\"><b>IAASB UPDATES FINANCIAL ESTIMATES AUDITS</b></p>\n<p class=\"noindent\">The International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB) wants to implement significant changes that would require auditors – in particular, auditors of financial institutions – to “sharpen their focus” on risks of material misstatements arising from accounting estimates.</p>\n<p>Among the proposed changes are: enhanced requirements for risk assessment procedures to include specific factors, such as complexity, judgment and estimation uncertainty, that are related to accounting estimates; a more detailed expectation for the auditor’s response to identified risks, including augmenting the auditor’s application of professional scepticism; and, critically, applicable regardless of the size and sector of the business or audit firm.</p>\n<p>The deadline for comments on Auditing Accounting Estimates and Related Disclosures is 1 August 2017.</p>\n<p class=\"noindent\"><a href=\"http://iaasb.org\" target=\"_self\">iaasb.org</a></p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 class=\"ezoeAlignleft text-left\"><b>BUSINESS</b></h2><p> </p>\n<p class=\"noindent\"><b>PEOPLE WITH SIGNIFICANT CONTROL RULES CHANGE</b></p>\n<p class=\"noindent\">Changes to the anti-money laundering rules, designed to increase the transparency of who owns and controls companies in the UK, come into operation from 26 June. They will affect the information companies need to provide about people with significant control (PSC).</p>\n<p>The changes include a new requirement to inform Companies House whenever there is a change in PSC (companies will have 14 days to update their register and another 14 to send the information to Companies House) and a tightening of the rules relating to companies that are currently exempt from requirements to hold information about their PSC.</p>\n<p>Also, from 24 July, both active Scottish limited partnerships and general Scottish partnerships where all the partners are corporate bodies will have to register PSC information with Companies House. They will be able to apply for a restriction so that the information is not published on the public register. Currently the only bodies entitled to access this information are specified public authorities, but the new AML legislation will extend the list to credit and financial institutions because they carry out customer due diligence.</p>\n<p class=\"noindent\"><a href=\"http://gov.uk\" target=\"_self\">gov.uk</a></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"noindent\"><b>GOVERNMENT GOLD PLATES AML LEGISLATION</b></p>\n<p class=\"noindent\">ICAEW has accused the Treasury of gold plating the draft regulations implementing the EU Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Directive into UK law. This is particularly so when it comes to client due diligence. It says that rather than taking a balanced, risk-based approach, firms will be required to find out and verify a large amount of information about corporate clients event though much of it will be of questionable usefulness.</p>\n<p>It points to the requirement, under draft regulation 28(3), for firms to get hold of the company’s memorandum of association. This, it says, is likely to prove onerous, not to mention useless in preventing or detecting money laundering since many articles of association will be largely identical as they are based on the model articles in company legislation. It also thinks the wording of the regulation could be interpreted to mean firms are required to verify the identity of not just the board of a client but senior management as well.</p>\n<p>ICAEW also takes the Treasury to task over the requirement for companies to respond to due diligence requests within two working days. This is gold plating, it says, that is entirely unreasonable and puts all UK companies, as well as firms, at a major competitive disadvantage compared to their overseas peers. “If an obligated entity has difficulty obtaining client due diligence information then that informs a risk-based judgement on continuation of the relationship.”</p>\n<p>Some of the regulations go way beyond the directive: for instance, the directive requires information on beneficial ownership to be held by trustees and submitted to a central register. But the regulations “significantly” widen the information required.</p>\n<p>ICAEW describes regulation 44 as a “disproportionate measure with a questionable purpose. It is unclear what providing details of legal, financial, tax or other advisers has to do with fighting money laundering and terrorist financing. ‘Other advice’ could presumably cover an extremely broad range of commercial services. Additionally, 44(4)(c) requires accounts and valuation of assets. It is unclear what is meant by valuation nor is there any consideration for the fact that many trusts don’t prepare accounts.”</p>\n<p>Other issues include the definition of a politically exposed person, which is wider than the directive’s, a general lack of clarity, the government approach to all non-casino gambling businesses as low risk, the cost to ICAEW members of the Disclosure and Barring Service checks and the overly tight implementation timetable.</p>\n<p class=\"noindent\"><a href=\"http://icaew.com\" target=\"_self\">icaew.com</a></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"noindent\"><b>CRIMINAL FINANCES ACT 2017</b></p>\n<p class=\"noindent\">The Criminal Finances Act 2017 will give law enforcement agencies and partners more powers to recover the proceeds of crime, tackle money laundering, tax evasion and corruption, and combat the financing of terrorism.</p>\n<p>Its provisions introduce unexplained wealth orders, which will be used to require those suspected of serious crime or corruption to explain the sources of their wealth, and criminal charges against companies for failing to prevent their staff from facilitating tax evasion. They enable the seizure and forfeiture of proceeds of crime and terrorist money stored in bank accounts and certain personal or moveable items such as precious metals and stones and works of art.</p>\n<p>The Act also provides legal protections for the sharing of information between regulated companies and extends the time period granted to law enforcement agencies to investigate suspicious transactions. It extends disclosure orders to cover money laundering and terrorist finance investigations, and it extends the existing civil recovery regime in the Proceeds of Crime Act to allow for the recovery of the proceeds of gross human rights abuses or violations overseas.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"noindent\"><b>NEW FORMS OF BUSINESS</b></p>\n<p class=\"noindent\">A new paper from ICAEW considers the development of different legal forms of business over the centuries and asks whether or not the existing approach, both domestically and internationally, is sustainable.</p>\n<p>In doing so, Future Enterprise: Assessing Forms of Business considers social and technological developments , including blockchain, and how these might make new approaches possible. “For instance,” it suggests, “we might permit individuals to benefit from limited liability without the need to incorporate a limited liability company – something the Office of Tax Simplification, in its small company taxation review of March 2016, advised the UK government to consider.”</p>\n<p>The paper also outlines some of the key issues that would need to be considered if the new approaches were taken forward.</p>\n<p class=\"noindent\"><a href=\"http://icaew.com\" target=\"_self\">icaew.com</a></p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 class=\"ezoeAlignleft text-left\"><b>PROFESSION</b></h2><p class=\"ezoeAlignleft text-left\"> </p>\n<p class=\"noindent\"><b>INPUT INTO IESBA'S FUTURE STRATEGIC DIRECTION</b></p>\n<p class=\"noindent\">The International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants (IESBA) is looking for views from its stakeholders on its strategic direction beyond 2018. In particular, it wants early input into the key issues it should address that may affect its Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants.</p>\n<p>It says that it will have the major projects it is currently working to strengthen and clarify the Code in place by the end of this year and then it will be looking for ways to make sure that the Code remains globally relevant and of high quality. “We recognise that beyond these improvements, it is in the public interest to continue to enhance the code as a bedrock of public trust in the global accountancy profession, and to promote its further adoption and effective implementation around the world,” said IESBA chairman Stavros Thomadakis.</p>\n<p>The survey closes on 18 July 2017.</p>\n<p class=\"noindent\"><a href=\"http://ifac.org\" target=\"_self\">ifac.org</a></p>\n<p class=\"noindent\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"noindent\"><b>AML SUPERVISORY REGIME - ICAEW COMMENTS</b></p>\n<p class=\"noindent\">The government’s proposals for an anti-money laundering (AML) oversight regime, combined with deregulation of the gambling sector, raise serious questions about its appreciation of where the greatest risks lie in the UK’s fight against money laundering and terrorist financing and the direction it has taken in addressing both, ICAEW says.</p>\n<p>In a hard-hitting response to the Treasury’s call for further information on the supervisory regime, it warns that the proposals for an AML oversight body to bring consistency in supervision across sectors will fail because it does not include oversight of all the supervisors across the accountancy sector, let alone multiple sectors. In fact, it puts greater distance between private and public sector supervisors than exists now.</p>\n<p>The response points out, as an example, that one of the most significant issues for the accountancy sector is the supervision  of individuals and firms that are not members of the prescribed accountancy bodies, who are theoretically regulated by HMRC. “Over the past 10 years, HMRC has struggled to meet the well-established requirements of an effective supervisor, in accordance with FATF (Financial Action Task Force) recommendations. So when a significant number of high-risk ASPs (accountancy service providers), supervised by a constitutionally hobbled supervisor, are excluded from the proposed oversight programme, this merely exacerbates the existing risks and inconsistencies in the current supervisory regime.”</p>\n<p>ICAEW also accuses the Treasury of failing to provide an evidence base to justify the purpose and design of the new oversight body, and not providing information as to its costs beyond requiring professional bodies and their membership to fund it.</p>\n<p class=\"noindent\"><a href=\"http://icaew.com\" target=\"_self\">icaew.com</a></p>\n<p class=\"noindent\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"noindent\"><b>PUBLIC INTEREST, CONFLICTS AND FEES GUIDANCE</b></p>\n<p class=\"noindent\">ICAEW has issued three guidance notes designed to help ICAEW members apply those parts of the Ethics Code relating to members’ duties to the public interest, identifying and addressing conflicts of interest, and setting the basis of determining fees. The guidance is in response to questions that arose in the FRC’s disciplinary proceedings against Deloitte in the MG Rover case.</p>\n<p>Essentially, the note on the public interest makes it clear that the principal public interest duty rests at the level of the profession itself, and that individual members discharge that duty by following the requirements of the Ethics Code in spirit as well as the letter.</p>\n<p>The note on conflicts of interest states that the Code does not ban members from undertaking engagements where different client interests conflict, provided that certain safeguards are applied and informed consent obtained. However, it warns that on some occasions, the threats to objectivity due to a conflict of interests may be of such significance that adequate safeguards cannot be established.</p>\n<p>The third note confirms that the Code does not require the amount of a fee to be justified as it is a commercial matter and discusses the key requirements that form the basis of charging fees so that no threat to objectivity arises.</p>\n<p class=\"noindent\"><a href=\"http://icaew.com/ethics\" target=\"_self\">icaew.com/ethics</a></p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 class=\"ezoeAlignleft text-left\"><b>REPORTING</b></h2><p> </p>\n<p class=\"noindent\"><b>GUIDANCE ON DISTRIBUTABLE PROFITS</b></p>\n<p class=\"noindent\">ICAEW and ICAS have published new joint guidance (Tech 02/17BL) on realised and distributable profits under the 2006 Companies Act. This is based on TECH02/10, Guidance on the Determination of Realised Profits and Losses in the Context of Distributions under the Companies Act 2006, but takes into account a number of changes since its publication, in particular the introduction of FRS 102.</p>\n<p>The application of new or revised standards may lead to changes in the timing and amount of profit recognised. Recent changes to accounting standards do not raise any fundamentally new issues in relation to realised and distributable profits. The guidance represents generally accepted practice at 31 December 2016 in relation to the meaning of realised profit. Both accountancy bodies warn that, while many of the revisions represent principles that were generally accepted prior to this date, “the revisions introduced now should not be used to question the lawfulness of distributions made at an earlier date”.</p>\n<p>“Balances on reserves,” they say, “will need to be re-examined in the light of the technical release and the position should be re-assessed before a distribution is made.” They go on to say that additional guidance about the definition of a distribution is based on legal advice. “Therefore, it is possible that some transactions previously entered into were distributions at the time and would have been unlawful in the absence of adequate distributable reserves. For example, this might apply to some intragroup loans on off market terms.”</p>\n<p class=\"noindent\"><a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/ldzd5oy\" target=\"_self\">tinyurl.com/ldzd5oy</a></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"noindent\"><b>CORPORATE REPORTING IN THE 21ST CENTURY</b></p>\n<p class=\"noindent\">Research by ICAEW into the future of corporate reporting has concluded that the conditions for radical change exist but a number of major issues stand in the way. What is needed, it says, is collective agreement among stakeholders on a way forward once and for all if the pace of change is to be accelerated, and broadly in one direction.</p>\n<p>In Change &amp; Continuity in Corporate Reporting: a Progress Report, ICAEW found that there is widespread agreement among stakeholders that the quality of narrative and non-financial disclosures in the “front half” of the annual report has improved significantly in the UK in recent years, especially when it comes to the business model, strategy, non-financial key performance indicators and drivers of long-term wealth creation. However, despite much debate about the impact of data analysis on the future of corporate reporting and audit, there has been little progress in developing technology as a corporate reporting tool.</p>\n<p>The report concentrated on the “front half” of the report, rather than the quality of the financial statements. However, it made an exception for what is regarded as the “Achilles’ heel” of financial reporting, the accounting and reporting of intangible assets. Attempts to tackle this problem have failed in the past and there is a lack of enthusiasm among standard-setters to try again. Nevertheless, there is appetite among investors for improved measurement. “Few intangibles meet the criteria for recognition on company balance sheets, except in the context of the acquisition of a business, and it was argued that this weakens the extent to which financial reporting can provide a clear picture of a company’s resources to investors and other users of financial reports.” This will only get worse as more businesses are driven by internally generated intangible assets that cannot be recognised in the financial statements.</p>\n<p>The interim report is based on a series of Financial Reporting Faculty thought leadership roundtables and meetings. It is not intended as a blueprint for change but  to further the debate about the future of corporate reporting. It will be followed up by another paper in 2018, which will take account of comments on this paper and related outputs and activities.</p>\n<p class=\"noindent\"><a href=\"http://icaew.com\" target=\"_self\">icaew.com</a></p>\n<p class=\"noindent\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"noindent\"><b>IFRS 9 – MINOR CHANGES</b></p>\n<p class=\"noindent\">The International Accounting Standards Board is intending to make minor amendments to IFRS 9, Financial Instruments. The effect of the changes will be to enable companies to measure at amortised cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income certain prepayable financial assets with so-called negative compensation (also known as symmetric prepayment options).</p>\n<p>The changes are in response to comments the standard-setter received about accounting for prepayment options. They are intended to improve the usefulness of information required by the standard about these financial assets.</p>\n<p>The implementation date for these changes is the same as the effective date for IFRS 9 – for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"noindent\"><b>HERITAGE REPORTING CONSULTATION</b></p>\n<p class=\"noindent\">The International Public Sector Accounting Standards Board is consulting about financial reporting for heritage in the public sector, with a view to reducing the variety of financial reporting practices for heritage items. These are items that are intended to be held indefinitely and preserved for the benefit of present and future generations because of their rarity and or significance.</p>\n<p>The consultation paper proposes that heritage items’ special characteristics do not prevent them from being assets for the purposes of financial reporting. In many cases, it says, a monetary value can by assigned and the items should be recognised in the statement of financial position if they meet the recognition criteria in the conceptual framework.</p>\n<p>The deadline for comments is 30 September 2017.</p>\n<p class=\"noindent\"><a href=\"http://ipsasb.org\" target=\"_self\">ipsasb.org</a></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"noindent\"><b>FRC TELLS INVESTORS WHAT TO LOOK OUT FOR IN 2017</b></p>\n<p class=\"noindent\">FRC chief executive Stephen Haddrill has written to institutional investors ahead of the 2017 shareholder meeting season advising them on what recent developments to look out for in listed companies’ annual reports and accounts. He is also keen to encourage them to engage with companies both “to provide a steer on what information they believe is relevant and to challenge where reporting falls short of expectations”.</p>\n<p>Among the areas Haddrill highlights in the letter are alternative performance measures (APMs), which are used to report performance. He points out that this will be the first year the APM guidelines from the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) apply to annual reports, and investors should expect to see disclosures in the strategic report that give a clear and complete understanding of the APMs presented, how they are calculated and why they are useful.</p>\n<p>Where relevant, a reconciliation to amounts present in the financial statements should be given.</p>\n<p>Companies should also be using the strategic report to explain clearly why they have selected their particular period of assessment for their viability statement, what qualifications and assumptions were made and how the underlying analysis was performed.</p>\n<p>The strategic report should make clear the impact of Brexit on the company’s business in the short term. “As the economic and political effects are developed and become more certain in the medium to longer term, we would expect boards to provide increasingly company specific disclosures with, ultimately, quantification of the effects.”</p>\n<p>Haddrill says there is room for improvement in the disclosure of accounting policies, particularly in relation to revenue recognition, while companies should be providing information on progress towards implementation of IFRS 15, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, IFRS 9, Financial Instruments, and IFRS 16, Leases.</p>\n<p class=\"noindent\"><a href=\"http://frc.org.uk\" target=\"_self\">frc.org.uk</a></p>\n<p class=\"noindent\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><b>TAX</b></h2><p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"noindent\"><b>MTD DROPPED FROM FINANCE ACT</b></p>\n<p class=\"noindent\">The government dropped several measures from the Finance Bill in the run-up to the General Election. They included the plans for Making Tax Digital (MTD), changes to corporate loss relief and interest deductibility, as well as VAT related to fulfilment houses and penalties for enablers of defeated tax avoidance schemes. The rest of the Finance Bill was rushed through the House of Commons after four hours of debate.</p>\n<p>Anita Monteith, tax manager at ICAEW, said the decision to drop the MTD plans was a “sensible” move. It came less than one week after ICAEW, the Federation of Small Businesses and ACCA joined forces to call for all MTD clauses in the Finance Bill to be removed. “Making Tax Digital plans remain controversial and need more scrutiny by those who will be affected, and most importantly proper parliamentary debate – a clear roadmap as to how MTD will work in practice is needed,” she added. “These seminal clauses and schedule can be reintroduced after the election which will allow more time for proper scrutiny.”</p>\n<p>Monteith urged the government to prioritise addressing the detailed questions that have been raised about how MTD will work in practice.</p>\n<p>The clauses are likely to return in another Finance Bill following the election.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"noindent\"><b>ICAEW BRIEFING ON DIGITAL RECORD-KEEPING</b></p>\n<p class=\"noindent\">As part of ICAEW’s continued efforts to work with government, and before it took MTD out of the Finance Act, the Tax Faculty put together a briefing for MPs on digital reporting and record-keeping for income tax, expressing its concerns about the lack of detail and asking for as many taxpayers as possible to be removed from the scope of self-assessment.</p>\n<p>“Although the proposals for MTD have been discussed widely for some time,” the briefing said, “we are still waiting for many of the detailed requirements. For example, it is not clear how MTD will work alongside the existing self-assessment system, how the exemptions will work, what details need to be reported, how amendments will be made, penalties levied and how appeals will operate.”</p>\n<p>The faculty also said that it had become clear that most of the legislation for MTD was going to be delegated to secondary legislation and then further to directions. Yet government was expecting both the tax professions and parliament to scrutinise legislation without sight of the complete package.</p>\n<p>Since the government remains committed to the digitalisation of the tax system, the faculty suggests that further work should be done to complete the legislative package before bringing it back. “We remain of the opinion that it is a mistake to rush this fundamental change to the administration of UK tax and that removing the mandation requirement would allow IT systems to be built and properly tested, so that businesses could then opt in as it made business sense for them to do so.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"noindent\"><b>MEPS CLOSE MULTINATIONALS' TAX LOOPHOLES</b></p>\n<p class=\"noindent\">The European Parliament has voted overwhelmingly to close loopholes that in the past have been exploited by some multinationals to avoid paying tax. The MEPs amended the EU’s anti-tax avoidance directive to prevent multinationals taking advantage of mismatches between EU and third countries’ tax rules to reduce their tax bills.</p>\n<p>“These arrangements are frequently used by the largest companies with the sole purpose of reducing corporate taxation,” said rapporteur Olle Ludvigsson. “We have seen it in both the Apple case and in the McDonald’s case. It is about time these corporations paid their fair share of taxes.”</p>\n<p>The amendments now go to the Council of Ministers for final approval. If it gives the go ahead, then corporations established in two jurisdictions (inside and outside the EU) for example, may no longer be able to have the same expenditure deducted from tax in both jurisdictions.</p>\n<p>The MEPs are also seeking to end to the practice of having a payment recognised as tax deductible in one jurisdiction but not recognised as taxable income in the other.</p>\n<p class=\"noindent\"><a href=\"http://europa.eu\" target=\"_self\">europa.eu</a></p>\n","layout":{"landscape":{"id":"am-dp1-layout5a","link":"story-landscape-layout3a.html"},"portrait":{"id":"am-dp1-layout6a","link":"story-portrait-layout3a.html"}},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":"","link_source":"","image":[],"url_alias":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com","type":"story","order":"31","folio_number":"","folio_numbers":"","pdf_page_index":"0","thumbnail":null,"color":"97c21c","real_id":"13766","main_section_id":"1291","ads":[]},{"id":"86f4ede876102615f01c1ac27047372d","title":"Watching the watchers","sub_title":"","author":[{"id":"0","name":"Emily Black","email":"emily.black@progressivecp.com","is_default":false}],"tag":"","strap_line":"Surveillance","short_intro":"","intro":"While most financial services firms will have been through some form of surveillance implementation programme, market, regulatory and commercial changes demand these are regularly updated and do not negatively affect day-to-day operations. Paul Golden reports","body":"<p class=\"dropcap\">PwC’s 2016 Market Abuse Surveillance Survey suggests that surveillance has yet to deliver as a fully effective tool for preventing market abuse in financial markets due in part to a lack of clarity about optimal organisation of responsibilities and activities. But, PwC observes, the stakes are too high for the firms not to make further investments. The EU Market Abuse Regulation (MAR) requires firms to use automated surveillance systems unless their business model justifies a manual approach.</p>\n<p>Involving technology, compliance/regulation/legal and front office staff from the start are some of the most central elements of a successful surveillance implementation programme, along with setting up a joint project group to work on the implementation, especially in larger organisations where there may be more distance between these parts of the business.</p>\n<p>Making sure data is in order before signing on with a vendor is also key. Regulations such as MAR and MiFID II require firms to monitor all trading activities, so to minimise the risk of delaying implementation and missing regulatory deadlines, firms should identify all data sources to be used in the surveillance solution before approaching vendors.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"noindent\"><b>SCALABLE AND ADAPTABLE</b></p>\n<p class=\"noindent\">Firms should also value flexibility and implement a technological solution that is scalable and adaptable in line with new or changing regulation and market characteristics. And any surveillance system must have the capability to digest multiple baskets of information – such as trades, positions, pricing and corporate action data – and after normalising that information uncover anomalous activity.</p>\n<p>Another vital aspect of implementing a trade surveillance system is ensuring that staff are capable of analysing and interpreting alerts. There are numerous off-the-shelf systems available, but they will only be effective if the firm has individuals with the time and expertise to understand their output. A key MAR requirement is that firms submit suspicious transaction and order reports to the FCA without delay, so it is essential they address this question of expertise during the implementation phase.</p>\n<p>“Firms should deploy technology solutions that are open, flexible and adaptable,” says Lars-Ivar Sellberg, executive chairman at Swedish soft-ware company Scila. “They should also avoid relying on too many proprietary formats in case they need to deploy a new system. The ability to pre-load historical data (up to seven years old) is key since regulators can investigate cases that are up to 10 years old, which we have seen with LIBOR and FX manipulation schemes.”</p>\n<p>According to Johannes Frey-Skött, assistant vice president apps engineering at Itiviti, a London-based company that delivers trading infrastructure solutions, detection and scoring are vital. “Detection because the system needs to allow for configurability – no two businesses are alike – and scoring because without any type of classification on the severity of a breach alert, users will be unable to prioritise.”</p>\n<p>Firms must pay attention to guidance provided by the trading venues in which they participate to ensure their surveillance systems keep pace with regulatory and market changes.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"right\" ><span class=\"hide\">\"</span><p>Firms should view surveillance as a business critical area and employ skilled people. Market surveillance is a sophisticated area</p>\n<span class=\"hide\">\"</span></blockquote>\n<p class=\"noindent\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"noindent\"><b>FIT FOR PURPOSE</b></p>\n<p class=\"noindent\">Trade surveillance systems need to be evaluated on a regular basis to ensure that they are appropriate for the markets and asset classes in which they operate. For instance, if a business were to begin transacting in a new type of derivative instrument it would be prudent to evaluate the type of manipulative activity that could occur in that instrument and adjust the settings of its trade surveillance system accordingly.</p>\n<p>It should work closely with vendors, industry associations and regulators to establish best practice. The surveillance programme should be seen as a long-term engagement, not a quick fix. It is the vendor’s responsibility to closely monitor technological developments such as the rise of artificial intelligence, blockchain and big data/cloud computing, since these areas can have a significant impact on market surveillance.</p>\n<p>Companies should take a risk-based approach and continuously evaluate surveillance risks related to their specific business areas. Characteristics in financial markets and consequently the risks associated with certain areas can change rapidly.</p>\n<p>“Firms can incorporate regular checks of relevant changes directly into their compliance monitoring programmes, which can be performed internally or with an external adviser,” says Miles Kellerman, an associate at Bovill. “This is essential as it will help ensure that firms are up to date on anti-market abuse rules.”</p>\n<p>According to Michael Lehman, a partner at ACA Surveillance Technology, the system should be able to adjust to the changing regulatory landscape. “A good example would be the MAR regulation. Any system should be able to include orders that may have been cancelled and not just those that were executed.”</p>\n<p>Firms should choose a surveillance solution that is easy to operate and minimises the workload for internal IT staff. Surveillance/compliance officers must have the appropriate level of expertise, skills and training to understand the products, types of potential abuses and red flags.</p>\n<p>The programme should have a focus on the ability to reduce false positives, for example by using backtesting/benchmarking and artificial intelligence (such as machine learning) techniques. Any modern surveillance system should have extensive capabilities to minimise false positives – a key concern and time-stealer with legacy surveillance solutions.</p>\n<p>The surveillance programme will gather and normalise an extensive set of data that can be used for business development purposes.</p>\n<p>“Firms should view surveillance as a business critical area and employ skilled people,” says Sellberg. “They should work with vendors who provide support and personalised user training. Market surveillance is a sophisticated area and may involve complex investigations into serious matters which can result in fines of millions of dollars, even for smaller trading firms.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"noindent\"><b>A BUSINESS TOOL</b></p>\n<p class=\"noindent\">By properly mapping the client’s data and truly understanding how they transact, a surveillance vendor can produce quality items of interest, says Lehman. “Old methodology was to generate large exception-based findings – proper surveillance is to de-noise that by adding multiple steps to the algorithm before reporting.”</p>\n<p>Frey-Skött advocates a managed solution to further reduce the time spent on hardware monitoring and upgrades. “Due to the many other obligations on companies around record keeping, reporting and analysis as part of MiFID II, it is prudent to combine solutions that include modules for market surveillance while also providing algo monitoring, market maker compliance, best execution, TCA, and so on. If this solution can be system agnostic, the investments companies need to make for compliance can be heavily reduced.”</p>\n<p class=\"callaction\"><b>How has the introduction of Market Abuse Regulation (MAR) across the EU since July 2016 affected you?

So no wonder practitioners are rubbing their hands now that gusts are whipping in from several directions.</p>\n<p>Brexit may be just a breeze at the moment – but it has the potential to turn into a gale. Then there are worries about slower growth in the developing world. And more protectionism in a Trumpish America. And the impact of higher interest rates or energy costs. Or unexpected sudden shocks to the world economy.</p>\n<p>In Britain, there are said to be thousands of “zombie companies” kept afloat by the lifebelts of low interest rates, clearing banks’ willingness to reschedule loans, and HMRC’s “time to pay” programme.</p>\n<p>“For some companies it’s been like kicking the can down the road,” says Tyrone Courtman, partner in PKF Cooper Parry, business advisers and accountants. But the question facing those companies doing the kicking is: how many more kicks before we run out of road?</p>\n<p>So for an accountancy practice that has not previously offered insolvency or business recovery services, could this be a good time to move into the market?</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"noindent\"><b>NEW RULES FOR OLD</b></p>\n<p class=\"noindent\">The question comes at a time of big change for insolvency. New insolvency rules for England and Wales – 446 pages of them – came into effect in April. They attempt to drag the process out of the age of the quill pen into the digital era.</p>\n<p>Out go lots of those printed documents such as creditors’ reports, which insolvency practitioners sent regularly by snail mail. In comes more information shared by email and through the insolvency practitioner’s website.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote class=\"right\" ><span class=\"hide\">\"</span><p>The UK is a great place to start and grow a business. A thriving economy needs insolvency practitioners to support a strong entrepreneurial culture</p>\n<span class=\"hide\">\"</span></blockquote>\n<p>“This should reduce the costs of communicating with creditors,” says Tony Nygate, business restructuring partner at BDO. “However, creditors will need to sign up for alerts to advise them that reports have been published to ensure that they don’t miss information that might be of interest to them.”</p>\n<p>Insolvency hasn’t been primarily about rules for a long time. Now it’s more about trying to save rather than kill off a business. So only knowing how to do formal insolvency is not enough for those who want to take on the most challenging assignments. They also need broader financial and business understanding and a keen sense of judgement.</p>\n<p>It’s not about turning up at five minutes to midnight any more, argues Courtman. “But the earlier you come into an assignment the more sectoral, rather than situational, experience you may need,” he adds.</p>\n<p>And there are changes in the way insolvency practitioners (IPs) are appointed, notes Angela Swarbrick, a restructuring partner at EY. “It mostly used to be clearing banks who appointed IPs,” she says. “Now debt is being traded and new players who buy up the debt have a right to appoint IPs – but may take a different view on a business’s long-term viability.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"noindent\"><b>WAYS INTO THE PROFESSION</b></p>\n<p class=\"noindent\">If you want to become an insolvency professional, you must pass two Joint Insolvency Board exams – one for corporate and one for personal insolvency. Alternatively, you can obtain a licence for either corporate or personal insolvency and then practice exclusively in your chosen area.</p>\n<p>But you need to know about more than just insolvency. For example, if you’re practising personal insolvency you would need to know about non-insolvency solutions such as debt arrangement schemes. There are five bodies that license IPs and before you take the exams you need to be registered with one.</p>\n<p>One of them is ICAEW – although Bob Pinder, regional director, notes that half the IPs ICAEW licences are not chartered accountants. He also points out that, for career entrants, the Institute has introduced the ICAEW Certificate in Insolvency. “The learning is delivered live through online interactive classrooms so students no longer need to leave the office,” he says.</p>\n<p>“This qualification also benefits those who perhaps don’t want to go on to take appointments but want a broad understanding of key insolvency principles.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"noindent\"><b>ENTERING THE MARKET</b></p>\n<p class=\"noindent\">Pinder is bullish about there being room in the market for more insolvency and business recovery professionals. “One of the things I’m particularly keen on is making sure ICAEW positions itself to support the next generation of insolvency practitioners,” he says. “The UK is a great place to start and grow a business. A thriving economy needs insolvency practitioners to support a strong entrepreneurial culture.”</p>\n<p>And Swarbrick notes that changes in the market suggest that new entrants have a chance to pick up business. “Historically, large insolvencies were dominated by the Big Four accountancy practices,” she says. “But now work is spread more broadly to mid-tier and smaller firms – which have been picking up higher profile assignments.”</p>\n<p>But she warns firms that think insolvency work is a gold mine that there is pressure on fees. Too many creditors think that IPs don’t provide value for money. But cost-cutting measures in the new insolvency rules and more transparency could help IPs prove they deliver better value.</p>\n<p>Pinder sees three routes into insolvency work for an accountancy practice that hasn’t done it before. “In the first instance, firms may decide to set up an arrangement with another ICAEW firm that has an insolvency and restructuring practice,” he says.</p>\n<p>“Alternatively, firms could recruit an existing insolvency practitioner to develop their own service line. Firms could also grow organically by identifying a member of their staff who is interested in business recovery and sponsoring them through the examinations.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"noindent\"><b>CASE IN POINT</b></p>\n<p class=\"noindent\">When mid-tier chartered accountants HW Fisher decided to set up a business recovery and insolvency division in 2012 it took around 18 months to get everything in place, recalls partner David Birne.</p>\n<p>It had to resolve a range of issues. One was whether to approach banks or company directors for work. The firm decided to approach both – and also its own clients.</p>\n<p>Then there was the question of how to charge struggling and cash-strapped companies. The approach: to tie some of the remuneration to the savings their work delivers for the client. When it came to bringing on board the skills they needed, the firm hired from two main groups – bankers and insolvency professionals.</p>\n<p>Adds Birne: “The key to winning clients is to build their confidence in what you can do for them. You have to become their confidante – and that requires the right personality.”</p>\n<p class=\"callaction\">ICAEW is investigating current trends and the outlook in the insolvency profession.

Since then, hundreds of member practices have gained accreditation to offer these services to clients.</p>\n<p>Few have looked back, though uptake has been better for some than for others.</p>\n<p>“We jumped straight in,” says Paul Stafford, partner at RDP Newmans. “The market was changing radically and we saw it as an opportunity to expand and support our portfolio of services. It seemed like a very obvious next step in our evolution, but I have to say that, two years down the line, we’ve not managed to convert the considerable interest shown initially into custom. I don’t know how other accountants are doing, but we’ve found that our clients are sticking with solicitors and we don’t want to be too aggressive in trying to poach business from our legal colleagues because, of course, we work closely with them.”</p>\n<p>Clive Stevens, partner at Kreston Reeves, is a champion of probate. Like Stafford, he was very keen to offer an additional service to clients and was quick off the blocks to take the exams. For his firm, though, the experience has been wholly positive, generating £1.2m in revenue. While that is a relatively small income stream when seen in context of its total annual £33m turnover, Stevens is nonetheless delighted with their progress.</p>\n<p>“We’ve put three of our own accountants through the probate exams and since our merger with Spofforths, last year, have gained another two lawyers who are regulated by ICAEW, so our investment in this is quite substantial,” says Stevens. “But so far so good. Our average fee for probate is £10,000, though we did have one exceptional case that brought in £104,000. And this year we have 42 live cases, so things are looking good.”</p>\n<p>Like RDP Newmans, Kreston Reeves is mindful and protective of its relations with solicitors, and there has been no hard sell to clients. “We’ve let it be known that we now offer probate by putting the information out there, but we’re certainly not pushing it hard,” says Stevens. “I don’t really see that we have to. Word is getting round organically, those who are interested are coming to us, and that’s how we want to play things. We don’t want to market this service aggressively.”</p>\n<p>Things are also looking good for Morgan Cameron. Director Margaret Thornton was at the vanguard of accountants who registered to provide probate, her motivation being a desire to provide her clients with a cradle to (beyond) the grave service. “We felt we could step in to help our clients at a time when they were at their most stressed, grieving the loss of a loved parent or spouse. So far the response has been good from clients and through IFAs.”</p>\n<div class=\"am_info_box\">\n\t<fieldset>\n\t<legend><div>KEYS TO SUCCESS</div></legend>\n\t<div class=\"text\"><p class=\"noindent\">Some people are reluctant to discuss their wills and post-death plans with families, but if you can encourage your clients to do so, you will save their beneficiaries potential stress, time and money. We all ought to be more open about our intentions, and what we’re leaving to whom.</p>\n<p>Probate is not just a business service and mustn’t be treated as such. You will be dealing with people who are grieving, vulnerable, and need to be treated with empathy and sensitivity. Offer a professional service, but also offer a shoulder to cry on and a sympathetic ear.</p>\n<p>Work out what it will cost. Setting yourself up to offer probate is expensive. You pay your fees to ICAEW upfront, before you’ve completed any cases and seen any money. And fees apply per person, not per firm, so the more people you register to do the exams, the higher your costs will be.</p>\n<p>If you are surrounded by well-established solicitors firms then building up a strong client base won’t be easy without marketing and effort. And obtaining and retaining a licence isn’t cheap so make sure that it adds value to the services you already offer.</p>\n</div>\n\t</fieldset>\n</div><p>Thornton says accountants will approach probate differently from solicitors. “We don’t replicate their processes, but apply our own to it. We’re used to doing accounts, so our documentation to prepare estate accounts uses the same procedures we use for other accounts. What we learnt very early on is that probate always takes much longer than people anticipate, and generally costs more than they expect, so we work hard to keep our clients informed. We update our clients every six weeks, giving them a new ETA, and an updated budget of costs.”</p>\n<blockquote class=\"right\" ><span class=\"hide\">\"</span><p><b>Word is getting round organically, those who are interested are coming to us, and that’s how we want to play things. We don’t want to market this service aggressively</b></p>\n<span class=\"hide\">\"</span></blockquote>\n<p>Stafford, Stevens and Thornton all agree that the rise in probate fees and the changes to the system are a “death tax” by any other name. “It’s another sum they will have to put down – in addition to existing IHT requirements – before they can access their inheritance,” says Stafford.</p>\n<p>“I think most will start to look at ways of financing the fees through bridging loans and other financial solutions and here is where I think accountants could really benefit, because we have a strong grasp of our client’s finances and will be well placed to provide reports to banks to help people secure the money they need to access their inheritance. With this in mind, I think we could see more people approaching accountants in the near future. But only time will prove whether I’m right or wrong.”</p>\n<p class=\"callaction\"><b>Probate represents one of the biggest new business opportunities to the accountancy profession.

Knowing how you intend to promote and deliver the service is key to its success.</p>\n<p class=\"noindent\"> </p>\n<p class=\"noindent\"><b>02: Research</b></p>\n<p class=\"noindent\">Know what you are getting in to and be certain there is a genuine desire locally for probate advice. Ask yourself if the payoff will be sufficient to make it worthwhile. And don’t alienate solicitors by trying to poach their clients.</p>\n<p class=\"noindent\"> </p>\n<p class=\"noindent\"><b>03: Be realistic</b></p>\n<p class=\"noindent\">Attitudes are changing, but progress is slow, so don’t expect a sudden rush of clients leaving their solicitor to come to you. You have to sell your services to them.</p>\n<p class=\"noindent\"> </p>\n<p class=\"noindent\"><b>04: Market the service</b></p>\n<p class=\"noindent\">If clients come to you before you are licensed, you can pass them on to other legal advisers before taking them on when you’re ready. People need to be aware that you will provide the service, so shout about it.</p>\n<p class=\"noindent\"> </p>\n<p class=\"noindent\"><b>05: Communicate</b></p>\n<p class=\"noindent\">Make sure the message about your new service is spread internally. All staff from your receptionists up to your partners need to know that you offer the service so it can be promoted alongside existing support.</p>\n</div>\n\t</fieldset>\n</div>","layout":{"landscape":{"id":"am-dp1-layout5","link":"story-landscape-layout3.html"},"portrait":{"id":"am-dp1-layout6","link":"story-portrait-layout3.html"}},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":"","link_source":"","image":[{"id":"8c0b12cf2a0d9a4fe271138afad09001","name":"Probate","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com/var/economia/storage/images/probate/125101-1-eng-GB/probate_story_img_size_708x442.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"708","height":"442","is_default":true},{"id":"8c0b12cf2a0d9a4fe271138afad09001","name":"Probate","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com/var/economia/storage/images/probate/125101-1-eng-GB/probate_story_img_size_472x438.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"472","height":"438","is_default":false}],"url_alias":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com","type":"story","order":"34","folio_number":"","folio_numbers":"","pdf_page_index":"0","thumbnail":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com/var/economia/storage/images/probate/125101-1-eng-GB/probate_tablet_story_thumbnail.jpg","color":"97c21c","real_id":"13774","main_section_id":"1291","ads":[]},{"id":"3a70b7d0585a733d6cd8a7fe91bac723","title":"Disciplinary listings","sub_title":"","author":[{"id":"0","name":"Emily Black","email":"emily.black@progressivecp.com","is_default":false}],"tag":"","strap_line":"Disciplinaries ","short_intro":"","intro":"These reports are summaries.
