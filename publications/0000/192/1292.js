What they haven’t done on Blur is roll out of bed, strum a few chords and loudly free-associate about the first thing that pops into their heads.”</p>\n<p class=\"noindent text-left\"><b>And now:</b> BBC Music’s Chris Jones: “This was the point when the Britpop dream – which had started to sour on Blur’s previous album, The Great Escape – was finally laid to rest.”</p>\n<p class=\"noindent text-left\"><b>What the band said about it:</b> The album’s genius is a result, partly, of guitarist Graham Coxon’s stated desire to “scare people again” and the raw, visceral lyrics of Damon Albarn. Coxon said in 2009: “I’m really fond of that record. I think it’s one of our best.”</p>\n<p class=\"noindent text-left\"><b>Why it’s so damn great:</b> The ethos of the album is encapsulated in Song 2, the track that broke America when America didn’t do Britpop; which contains the most mind-bending of Albarn’s lyrical stylings (When I feel heavy metal/And I’m pins and I’m needles); which has a lead bass guitar; and the intro of which is arguably the finest work of the finest guitar player of his generation.</p>\n<p class=\"noindent text-left\"> </p>\n<p class=\"noindent text-left\"><b>DIG YOUR OWN HOLE</b></p>\n<p class=\"noindent text-left\"><b>Band:</b> Chemical Brothers</p>\n<p class=\"noindent text-left\"><b>Label:</b> Virgin/Freestyle Dust</p>\n<p class=\"noindent text-left\"><b>What the music press said then:</b> John Mulvey at NME: “Dig Your Own Hole is the fully-honed, full-on, block-rocking, cortex-hammering, take-no-prisoners real deal… It’s the lairy, hedonistic triumph of lad techno.”</p>\n<p class=\"noindent text-left\"><b>And now:</b> BBC Music: “There’s still been nothing quite like Dig Your Own Hole. It was a moment where the Chemical Brothers could harvest the minds and mess up the hearing of a whole new crowd of converts, and remains an immense, far out and most staggering work.”</p>\n<p class=\"noindent text-left\"><b>What the band said about it:</b> Ed Simons, one half of the duo: “Why is it left to a group like Oasis to express the way that young people want to go out? That’s what we are about. Tom and I are out all the time, off to clubs and gigs, living fast, living it up. That’s what I hope we’re putting across on our record.”</p>\n<p class=\"noindent text-left\"><b>Why it’s so damn great:</b> It’s an electrifying – occasionally terrifying – mash-up of rock machismo and crazy electronica, filtered through the warped minds of a couple of music-mad geeks. Even after 20 years, it still sounds like the future. And if there has ever been a more out there No.1 single than the Beatles-twisting, Noel Gallagher collaboration Setting Sun, we’ve yet to hear it.</p>\n<p class=\"noindent text-left\"> </p>\n<p class=\"noindent text-left\"><b>BUENA VISTA SOCIAL CLUB</b></p>\n<p class=\"noindent text-left\"><b>Band:</b> Buena Vista Social Club</p>\n<p class=\"noindent text-left\"><b>Label:</b> World Circuit</p>\n<p class=\"noindent text-left\"><b>What the music press said then:</b> Rolling Stone’s Tom Moon described it as: “A collection of enduring reminders that in Cuba, the wisdom of the ages still counts for something.”</p>\n<p class=\"noindent text-left\"><b>And now:</b> One critic recently expressed the view that Buena Vista Social Club has become “world music’s equivalent of The Dark Side of the Moon”.</p>\n<p class=\"noindent text-left\"><b>What the band said about it:</b> Talking to a radio station in 2000, Ry Cooder, co-producer, musical director and organising force behind the album: “People say: ‘You knew this was going to happen.’ I say: ‘Are you kidding me?’ Find one reason why this would have been popular. There’s no logic.”</p>\n<p class=\"noindent text-left\"><b>Why it’s so damn great:</b> Timeless tunes played with exceptional skill by musicians with a lifetime of experience, many of them living in obscurity when Ry Cooder called them. The music has an immediacy as well as a warmth, patina and familiarity that makes it hard to resist. It sold 8 million copies worldwide, changed the way the world saw Cuban music and spawned a fabulous Wim Wenders documentary. Barack Obama was also a fan, as he told those musicians still alive who were invited to the White House in 2015.</p>\n\n<div class=\"object-left\"><div class=\"hide gallery\">\n<ul><li>12e3a3d07deac51f2084436d43e5dc8a</li><li>cb1d153c1b93c7b0276b4547feb9e9fe</li><li>09de880cba6f2e277ea0db43122acd4f</li><li>a8f1bfda9dbe1e6f5e777ab6d9bd730f</li><li>619d4b457ec4ace267252849fc1afe0a</li><li>71df3ef0d3168140780cc8032f50f518</li><li>d562171de95b73e1045b7ac2f435d186</li><li>8e936277d35aecd7625e2caf3a48d28a</li><li>afae797a8614d16fc87f3c95d9077950</li><li>d4b2292b53952fc691c82475b465a51e</li></ul>\n</div></div><p class=\"noindent text-left\"><b>HOMEWORK</b></p>\n<p class=\"noindent text-left\"><b>Band:</b> Daft Punk</p>\n<p class=\"noindent text-left\"><b>Label:</b> Virgin</p>\n<p class=\"noindent text-left\"><b>What the music press said then:</b> In March 1997, Pete Tong introduced Daft Punk for their first BBC Essential Mix by saying: “We are pleased to introduce two French blokes.”</p>\n<p class=\"noindent text-left\"><b>And now:</b> Twenty years on, Billboard said Homework sounds less dated than any other major electronic album from 1997, because “it turns out the big beat paragons weren’t thinking nearly big enough”.</p>\n<p class=\"noindent text-left\"><b>What the band said about it:</b> Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo and Thomas Bangalter told Magic magazine that Homework was supposed to have been a collection of singles rather than an album. The duo told the Swedish blog Pop Viminns that the record was created from start to finish in Bangalter’s bedroom with their own equipment, hence its name. In 2001, Daft Punk told The Guardian that Homework was “a happy thing, but there was also anger – a statement”.</p>\n<p class=\"noindent text-left\"><b>Why it’s so damn great:</b> Homework is one of the most influential electronic albums ever written. When it came out, hits including Da Funk and Around the World drew attention to the French house music scene and are still relevant today.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"right\" ><span class=\"hide\">\"</span><p><b>The moment we hear those apocalyptic synths roll in, we can’t help but want to set everything on fire. Simply put, Firestarter is an absolute classic</b></p>\n<span class=\"hide\">\"</span></blockquote>\n<p class=\"noindent text-left\"><b><b>THE FAT OF THE LAND</b></b></p>\n<p class=\"noindent text-left\"><b>Band:</b> The Prodigy</p>\n<p class=\"noindent text-left\"><b>Label:</b> XL records</p>\n<p class=\"noindent text-left\"><b>What the music press said then:</b> David Browne, writing for Entertainment Weekly: “[The] Prodigy once confined themselves to robotic squiggles, but last year’s genre-busting single Firestarter proved what could be accomplished by merging techno with punk and hard rock. Shrewdly taking his cue from that song, Prodigy leader and beat master Liam Howlett has made The Fat of the Land harder, more subterranean, more diverse, and more vocal-oriented than previous Prodigy records.</p>\n<p class=\"noindent text-left\"><b>And now</b>: Mixmag described the scowling, in-your-face Firestarter: “The moment we hear those apocalyptic synths roll in, we can’t help but want to set everything on fire. Simply put, this is an absolute classic.”</p>\n<p class=\"noindent text-left\"><b>What the band said about it:</b> In an interview with The Independent, Liam Howlett, co-founder and songwriter said: “I’m not doing another album. There isn’t another Prodigy album. I went through so much pressure. I don’t want to go through that again.” The band has released a further three studio albums since.</p>\n<p class=\"noindent text-left\"><b>Why it’s so damn great:</b> Despite the scene, and genre, having many incarnations, the growling, grinding rhythm of The Fat of the Land has had few rivals for its intimidating clashing of sounds. It is a defining album of the 1990s.</p>\n<p class=\"noindent text-left\"> </p>\n<p class=\"noindent text-left\"><b>LADIES AND GENTLEMEN WE ARE FLOATING IN SPACE</b></p>\n<p class=\"noindent text-left\"><b>Band:</b> Spiritualized</p>\n<p class=\"noindent text-left\"><b>Label:</b> Dedicated</p>\n<p class=\"noindent text-left\"><b>What the music press said then:</b> Released on the same day as Radiohead’s OK Computer, Jason Pierce’s third album made it to the top of NME’s releases of the year: “It is, quite simply, a seismic tour de force. The work of a man who, having assimilated an army of influences – Captain Beefheart, Sly Stone, Elvis, Zappa, Red Crayola – has managed to create an entirely new noise.”</p>\n<p class=\"noindent text-left\"><b>And now:</b> After seeing the album played in full at The Barbican, The Telegraph wrote: “There isn’t a single dud track on Ladies and Gentlemen… Come Together still sounded both addictive and forbidding and its concluding gospel affirmation was irresistible.”</p>\n<p class=\"noindent text-left\"><b>What the band said about it:</b> “I think records are like time-capsules or spaceships. You finish them and push them off and they start relating to other people. They’re not really my records any more, so because of that you have to get them absolutely right... It’s the easiest medium, it’s rock ’n’ roll, how much more f***ing simple can it get?”</p>\n<p class=\"noindent text-left\"><b>Why it’s so damn great: </b>Apart from having possibly the best album packaging ever – Google it – the music is 70 minutes of escapism and pathos. There are songs about drugs, break-ups and spirituality, influenced by the blues and gospel, with a bit of trance-rock thrown in. Try to listen to Broken Heart without crying.</p>\n\n<div class=\"object-left\"><div class=\"hide gallery\">\n<ul><li>ff835485951b2679f4ea4bb84d2813fa</li><li>4d375cc357570e795a6627f31deb0e0c</li><li>103574731d34e180ade75e4ecc122db3</li><li>29e08c1635bd4d9cb4a400581082f38f</li><li>8feba3a57166c7965ed0dde17a454f16</li><li>e6eb766789b79f63ff5ce7d7313ed80a</li><li>970d4b38b92530318872191f30a88cea</li><li>c146461fe1c1704c9e375ab1394ad7fe</li><li>490ea0d057f7c031d630decfb1523579</li><li>390f0fd1e59923d63ef935a53b303f03</li></ul>\n</div></div><p class=\"noindent text-left\"><b>URBAN HYMNS</b></p>\n<p class=\"noindent text-left\"><b>Band:</b> The Verve</p>\n<p class=\"noindent text-left\"><b>Label:</b> Hut Records</p>\n<p class=\"noindent text-left\"><b>What the music press said then:</b> The Verve’s third album came after a brief split in 1995 due to tensions within the band. Entertainment Weekly said the album was “a surprising and stunning comeback.”</p>\n<p class=\"noindent text-left\"><b>And now:</b> On bbc.co.uk: “The thing is, Urban Hymns still sounds thrilling. Grand daubs of baroque rock and massive, sweeping arrangements sit side by side with heartbreaking declarations of failure.”</p>\n<p class=\"noindent text-left\"><b>What the band said about it:</b> Richard Ashcroft revealed: “The Verve are not complete without Nick McCabe (the band’s guitarist).” He expressed disappointment that the distinctive string hook on the album’s first single cost him both the songwriting credit and all the royalties.</p>\n<p class=\"noindent text-left\"><b>Why it’s so damn great:</b> A good album can transcend time, generation gaps and cultural shifts, embedding its enduring appeal. Urban Hymns went 10-times platinum in the UK and is still the 18th bestselling album ever released in the country.</p>\n<p class=\"noindent text-left\"> </p>\n<p class=\"noindent text-left\"><b>OK COMPUTER</b></p>\n<p class=\"noindent text-left\"><b>Band:</b> Radiohead</p>\n<p class=\"noindent text-left\"><b>Label:</b> Parlophone</p>\n<p class=\"noindent text-left\"><b>What the music press said then:</b> Music journo Paul Morley: “One of the basic messages of this album is, ‘Love the beauty of speed.’ Radiohead, looking at times just like a rock group, are unhinged cybertravellers.”</p>\n<p class=\"noindent text-left\"><b>And now:</b> Duncan Lindsay for metro.co.uk wrote: “The Radiohead album, which was well ahead of its time when it was first released in Japan on 19 May 1997, remains the most genius compilation of music ever created.”</p>\n<p class=\"noindent text-left\"><b>What the band said about it: </b>On the provenance of the album, lead singer Thom Yorke said: “I found myself in a computer store and all of a sudden I get this thought: What if a computer could go drive a car? Then I laughed, ’cause I got the picture of a computer drinking a pint and hanging out with his computer mates. Then all of a sudden I stopped laughing, because I got the idea of what if a computer could play guitar. I was transfixed by this idea. And that’s when I knew: We needed to do an album about that.”</p>\n<p class=\"noindent text-left\"><b>Why it’s so damn great:</b> The giddying sweetness-to-dissonance sweep of Jonny Greenwood’s genius guitar riffs coupled with Yorke’s twitchy, lyrical artistry made it an unsettling kicker of an album 20 years ago, and it still sounds unique today.</p>\n<p class=\"noindent text-left\"> </p>\n<p class=\"noindent text-left\"><b>WU-TANG FOREVER</b></p>\n<p class=\"noindent text-left\"><b>Band:</b> Wu-Tang Clan</p>\n<p class=\"noindent text-left\"><b>Label:</b> Loud/RCA Records</p>\n<p class=\"noindent text-left\"><b>What the music press said then:</b> Neil Strauss at the New York Times: “The album effortlessly slices through the noise and music around it, thanks chiefly to its producer, known as the RZA, whose precision beats ring crisply and sharply in the air while the sound snippets he uses to back the raps propel them like slingshots. Then there are the lyrics, as dense, obsessed, prolific and full of popular and arcane references as a Pynchon novel.”</p>\n<p class=\"noindent text-left\"><b>And now:</b> Jack Hamilton at Slate: “At the time of its release, both the album and its expectations felt so daunting it seemed impossible to evaluate, but it’s aged remarkably well, and its best tracks are worthy of its predecessor.”</p>\n<p class=\"noindent text-left\"><b>What the band/artist said about it:</b> Method Man: “The sum of our parts is worth all the organising. It’s like the Power Rangers where they come together… This album will destroy every hip-hop record made in the past 10 years.”</p>\n<p class=\"noindent text-left\"><b>Why it’s so damn great:</b> Biggie Smalls was killed earlier in 1997 and hip-hop was at a crossroads. It was trending towards more money, more cars, more everything. Instead Wu-Tang released a double album that was introspective, complicated and had few hooks. But with nine MCs at their peak and RZA orchestrating, it was brilliant.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"left\" ><span class=\"hide\">\"</span><p>The sum of our parts is worth all the organising.

New owners Sam and Eddie Hart and, particularly, chef Jeremy Lee, serve up a simple celebration of classic dishes and comfort eating to kick-start any morning and bring a smile to the most Monday of faces.</p>\n<p class=\"noindent\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"noindent\"><b>LUNCH</b></p>\n<p class=\"noindent\"><b>The Fat Duck, Bray, Berkshire</b></p>\n<p class=\"noindent\"><a href=\"http://thefatduck.co.uk\" target=\"_self\"><b>thefatduck.co.uk</b></a></p>\n<p class=\"noindent\">Heston Blumenthal’s experimental cooking at The Fat Duck put the British culinary scene firmly on the world map. These days lunch is the perfect time to visit as it leaves you several hours to digest your epic, multi-course tasting menu and to process what just happened. It may be much imitated, it may be expensive, but, seriously, you’ve got to do it.</p>\n<p class=\"noindent\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"noindent\"><b>DINNER</b></p>\n<p class=\"noindent\"><b>Number One, Edinburgh</b></p>\n<p class=\"noindent\"><b><a href=\"http://roccofortehotels.com\" target=\"_self\">roccofortehotels.com</a></b></p>\n<p class=\"noindent\">Celebrating 20 years – and 12 years of its Michelin star – Edinburgh’s Number One restaurant is, arguably, Edinburgh’s number one restaurant.</p>\n<p>While the name refers to the address of The Balmoral Hotel, where executive chef Jeff Bland and head chef Brian Grigor’s deeply consistent restaurant can be found, the moniker is clearly apt. It may have sounded boastful in 1997, shortly after Sir Rocco Forte purchased the hotel, but then there wasn’t much competition. These days Edinburgh’s a very different kettle of locally-sourced fish – Timberyard, Ondine, The Dogs, Tom Kitchin’s restaurants, the brilliant Mark Greenaway to name but a few – but Grigor’s place continues to deliver, and in relaxed surroundings that don’t feel like a hotel restaurant.</p>\n<p>While techniques nod to the French, the ingredients celebrate the Scottish “larder” and, at the right times of year, a generous selection of game – unsurprising as Grigor comes from a family of gamekeepers.</p>\n<p>That sort of family connection is also what removes a lot of stuffiness from Number One. It may be an altar to world-class ingredients but it’s also a genuinely relaxed experience: no wonder so many of the staff have been here for years.</p>\n<p>The Balmoral’s Tomatin smoked salmon is as mellow and fruity as the whisky that lends it its name, and as decadent as anything else so royally titled.</p>\n<p>Elsewhere, wild turbot and beef fillet may be gilded with assorted culinary “trickery” – spring tabbouleh and lemongrass with the fish, hay cooked short rib and bone marrow fondant with the beef – but these sleights of hand are simply there to let the main ingredient shine.</p>\n<p>The Scottish reputation for a general lack of vegetables and fruit is one of those silly, annoying myths. Scottish produce – berries and rhubarb in particular – are some of the world’s best, so even a vegetarian can eat contentedly here. A beetroot dish – with goat’s curd, onion ash and beetroot sorbet – looks suitably regal and purple, but could almost convert a carnivore to the cause. Mind you, a cracking little haggis truffle surprise will drag them straight back…</p>\n<p>Cooking is assured, service is confident, the sommelier’s matches and general suggestions throw up some gems and the cheeseboard is really rather fine as well. Number One is simply a very good restaurant.</p>\n","layout":{"landscape":{"id":"am-dp1-layout29","link":"story-landscape-layout15.html"},"portrait":{"id":"am-dp1-layout30","link":"story-portrait-layout15.html"}},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":"","link_source":"","image":[{"id":"8a083974a289a60e69939bdcadd43ce0","name":"restaurant","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com/var/economia/storage/images/restaurant21/125398-1-eng-GB/restaurant_story_img_size_708x339.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"708","height":"339","is_default":true},{"id":"8a083974a289a60e69939bdcadd43ce0","name":"restaurant","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com/var/economia/storage/images/restaurant21/125398-1-eng-GB/restaurant_story_img_size_964x413.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"964","height":"413","is_default":false}],"url_alias":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com","type":"story","order":"38","folio_number":"","folio_numbers":"","pdf_page_index":"0","thumbnail":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com/var/economia/storage/images/restaurant21/125398-1-eng-GB/restaurant_tablet_story_thumbnail.jpg","color":"d87028","real_id":"13815","main_section_id":"1292","ads":[]},{"id":"a0ea4e0e3e6e6c281fd74b6cd582f53d","title":"Calling the tune","sub_title":"","author":[{"id":"0","name":"Emily Black","email":"emily.black@progressivecp.com","is_default":false}],"tag":"","strap_line":"Life after work","short_intro":"","intro":"Former PwC partner Nadine Majaro talks to Peter Taylor-Whiffen about hitting the high notes in her musical life","body":"<p class=\"dropcap\">Singing in a choir,” says Nadine Majaro, “is fantastic. You’re challenging yourself to control your voice and hit the notes, so it’s a physical workout; it gives you intellectual stimulation, learning all those pieces; and it’s a communal activity – a coming together with other people. And then on top of all of that, when you all hit those notes, and there’s a full orchestra and wonderful soloists, you get moments of pure magic.”</p>\n<p>Majaro has been singing “most of my life” and is a member of the Highgate Choral Society and the University College School (UCS) Centenary Choir in north London. Since leaving the day job at PwC she also has taken up the cello (“there was one lying around the house that nobody played, so I thought I’d have a go”), completed an OU degree and a Masters, volunteers with a number of charities and is preparing to revamp and redesign a recently acquired overgrown and neglected two-acre garden. It’s a wonder she ever found time to work.</p>\n<p>“I think you have to make the most of your time, and do something social and sociable,” she says. “I’m thoroughly enjoying it all.”</p>\n<p>Majaro joined what was then Price Waterhouse’s graduate training scheme straight from the University of Oxford in 1978. Her degree in philosophy, politics and economics gave her five immediate job offers but she admits: “I chose accountancy so I could defer deciding what I really wanted to do for another three years!”</p>\n<p>But she ended up staying for the next 25, beginning in audit and working with the firm’s financial services practices in New York, before returning to London, where she “mainly audited banks”, became a partner and then ran PwC’s Transform practice, delivering training to clients.</p>\n<p>She left PwC in 2003 but was keen to put her experience to good use. “I had done a lot of work in social investment and wanted to keep working in a social, charitable capacity.” Her skills were soon snapped up with voluntary roles at organisations promoting social investment, including CAF’s Venturesome Investment Committee and Big Society Capital. “It was a great opportunity to use my knowledge for good,” she says. “If you can do that, you have a responsibility to do so.”</p>\n<p>Majaro, now 60, sounds like someone who counts her blessings. “We (she is married with two grown-up children) are fortunate to have the opportunities we do. We have two properties – in Hampstead, where we enjoy all that London has to offer with theatres and restaurants, and another in Devon, where we have the two-acre garden. That’s a lot of work in the planning and the execution, but it’s tremendously exciting.”</p>\n<p>But music remains her keenest passion. “I love it,” she says. “I’m enjoying the singing, and the cello lessons – I even play lead cello in a small amateur orchestra, which carries some responsibility. Do we play to the public? I think of them as tolerant friends.”</p>\n","layout":{"landscape":{"id":"am-dp1-layout29","link":"story-landscape-layout15.html"},"portrait":{"id":"am-dp1-layout30","link":"story-portrait-layout15.html"}},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":"","link_source":"","image":[{"id":"5eff031a8b7916e682ddfed51adbe648","name":"after-work","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com/var/economia/storage/images/after-work18/125423-1-eng-GB/after-work_story_img_size_708x339.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"708","height":"339","is_default":true},{"id":"5eff031a8b7916e682ddfed51adbe648","name":"after-work","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com/var/economia/storage/images/after-work18/125423-1-eng-GB/after-work_story_img_size_964x413.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"964","height":"413","is_default":false}],"url_alias":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com","type":"story","order":"39","folio_number":"","folio_numbers":"","pdf_page_index":"0","thumbnail":"http://economia-live.audiencemedia.com/var/economia/storage/images/after-work18/125423-1-eng-GB/after-work_tablet_story_thumbnail.jpg","color":"d87028","real_id":"13818","main_section_id":"1292","ads":[]}],"type":null,"ads":[]}}
