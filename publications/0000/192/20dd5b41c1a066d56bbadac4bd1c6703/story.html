<p class="dropcap">It is the normal conceit of every age to think that it is special, and that life is tough. For leaders, the conceit may be true: life really is getting harder. The main suspect is technology. Whereas in the past leaders could leave work behind in the office, today they are meant to be on 24/7. Many leaders wear their ball and chain of internet and email with pride: they like to show they can stay on top of things all the time. This does not show leadership: it shows insecure control freakiness.</p>
<p>Leadership has never really been about technology. Leaders from Caesar to Napoleon and Churchill did passably well without ever sending an email. Leadership has always been about people. It is people, not technology that is making leadership harder.</p>
<p>A brief, revisionist, history of leadership will show why it is becoming so much harder to lead today.</p>
<p>Business leadership really took off with the Industrial Revolution. In the 19th century, leadership was fairly straightforward. The bosses had the brains and the workers had the hands. The job of the boss was to transmit ideas from their heads into the hands of workers who were treated as unthinking and unreliable machines who were to be coerced or coaxed into working efficiently.</p>
<p>This was a world of time and motion, of reason and analysis. It was a world for the educated elite, where IQ ruled. This was an agreeable arrangement for the bosses, less agreeable for the workers.</p>
<p>Then things started to go wrong. Marx had predicted that the workers would eventually rise up against the bosses and owners of capital. He was only half wrong. The workers did something far worse than revolt: they got educated. This meant that they could achieve more, but they also demanded more. Bosses could no longer treat them as unreliable machines. Workers had to be treated as human beings.</p>
<p>In the course of the 20th century, the education of the workforce proceeded at pace. The more educated people become, the less they seem to like being managed. Anyone who has to manage highly qualified professionals recognises this challenge. Anyone who has seen a university faculty at work knows that they are near to being unmanageable. Eventually, management theory caught up and discovered that IQ is not enough. In addition to being smart, you need emotional intelligence as well, or EQ.</p>
<p>In the 21st century, things have become even harder. In the past, the art of management was making things happen through people you controlled. Every manager and leader built their empire, and that is what they managed. Today, leaders have to make things happen through people they do not control. That changes everything.</p>
<p>Standard operating procedure is to find that your responsibilities exceed your resources. As firms delayer and outsource, you have to make things happen through colleagues inside and outside the firm, who may be anywhere in the world. The old certainties of the 20th century seem a long time ago.</p>
<p>In this new world, leaders need new skills. You have to be able to align agendas, fight for resources, create alliances, build networks of trust and support, and know which battles to fight when. You can no longer make all the decisions, you have to influence decisions and decision making processes. You can no longer command support, you have to build support. You no longer rely on authority, because you never have enough authority: you have to use influence.</p>
<p>This new set of skills can be described as PQ or Political Quotient. Politics can be a dirty word, but it is vital in a firm. It is how you make things happen, how you exercise power without having formal authority, it is how you make the firm work for you. Inevitably, the most vital skills are the ones that are least taught. Business schools are only emerging slowly from the 19thÂ  century IQ skills set to the 20th century skills set of EQ. No one teaches PQ yet. This is a wonderful opportunity for all emerging leaders: master the skills of PQ and you master your destiny.</p>
