<p class="dropcap">When I became ICAEW president 12 months ago, I saw my role as helping our institute to pursue its strategy and leave it even stronger by the end of my year. So I am delighted that we are currently implementing our new strategy, which we have developed over the year. Our vision encompasses creating “a world of strong economies”. In other words, we will work – both collectively as an institute and individually as members – with others to create strong, accountable and open economies where people can trust data, leaders can make good decisions, public finances are transparent and businesses are responsible.</p>
<p>In implementing that strategy, we have identified three cornerstones. The first, future professionals, is about making sure that our current and future members have got the right skills, knowledge and attitude to equip them for the challenges of a career as a chartered accountant.</p>
<p>I have no doubt from all the students and members that I’ve met throughout my presidential year that ICAEW’s future will be very bright. Similarly, I am confident, from the groups I’ve met, that the second element, connected communities, is also in good hands.</p>
<p>I’ve seen how much we have to gain by meeting each other, whether face to face or through our virtual communities, and how it contributes to increasing that sense that we all belong to our institute. This is particularly important to me given that one of my two presidential themes was making ICAEW more inclusive.</p>
<p>With that in mind – and as the first academic to become ICAEW president – I was doubly delighted when we recently launched our academia and education community. Interestingly, more than 3,000 of our members tell us they work in education, over half of whom are women. However, our community is not just for them: we are opening it up for free to anyone interested in ICAEW and profession-related topics.</p>
<p>The third element of our strategy is about being an agile institute, which again really resonates with my second theme, adaptability. Being agile means making sure that we are able to shape and react to external events quickly and have the resources to make an impact on behalf of our members, the profession and the public interest. All three elements are inextricably bound together and form a link between the Institute’s heritage and its future.</p>
<p>It has been an amazing privilege to have been your president. I’d like to say thank you to my fellow volunteers, to our amazing staff and to all our members. You’ve made me so proud of ICAEW and I am delighted now to be passing the baton to incoming president Nick Parker who, I am sure, will also have a rewarding and successful year.</p>
