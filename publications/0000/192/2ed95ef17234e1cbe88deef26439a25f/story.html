<p class="dropcap">This is not unique to this election. It explains why Bill Clinton’s accidental mantra of “the economy, stupid” (initially intended only for campaign workers) continues to resonate with voters. It is also why anything but a thumping win for the Conservatives on 8 June will be a shock. Not only is Labour in disarray over Brexit – inevitably a complex issue for a party with MPs representing some of the most aggressively pro-Leave and pro-Remain constituencies – but it’s struggling to regain public trust on the economy. The vision of Labour as tax and spend idealists, unable to balance the books, has been boosted by the response to a manifesto that doesn’t hide its ambition to see a bigger state, funded by taxes on business and the rich (however that term is defined). Even solid Labour backers suggest it is preparing for opposition rather than government. In Scotland, where the independence question complicates things, it looks like Labour could even be beaten into an uncomfortable fourth place. Quite how the Lib Dems will perform and what role they will play in opposition is unclear.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Conservatives continue to repeat soundbites and slogans, insisting that only Theresa May’s team offers the “strong and stable leadership” needed, in a campaign that has become overtly presidential. There has been an unwillingness to engage on policy issues with the focus on rallies where slogans are repeated to crowds of adoring, placard-waving converts. </p>
<p>This makes sense, given the respective positions of the party leaders. Even if voters find some Labour manifesto pledges interesting, do they trust the party leadership? No wonder Team Theresa is so focused on repeating the message that she is the safe choice. The polls endorse this, showing a consistent 15 to 20-point lead for the Conservatives. Labour supporters clinging to the hope that pollsters have been wrong before should consider that, if anything, polls tend to underestimate Conservative support and overinflate that for Labour.</p>
<p>What is more surprising is that the numbers fly in the face of the Clinton mantra. Seven years into a period where average pay dropped sharply and has recovered so slowly that living standards are only just reaching pre-crisis levels, the government shouldn’t be popular, let alone ahead by 20 points. Accepting five years were in coalition and six were under a different leader, voters seem happy to blame anyone else, with fingers pointed at bankers, the last Labour government, the global elite and even Europe. If the electorate does give May her mandate to run the economy and take on Europe in the Brexit negotiations, neither will be easy. And if things go wrong, next time there will be no one else to blame.</p>
