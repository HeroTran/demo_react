<h2 class="noindent"><b>HEAVY LOAD</b></h2><p class="noindent">The decommissioned Brent Delta Topside oil platform now stands in a quay at the Able UK plant’s Seaton Port in Hartlepool after arriving to be scrapped. The heaviest single cargo ever to be lifted in the history of the oil and gas industry, it arrived on the Pioneering Spirit transporter ship from the Shell-owned Brent oilfield, 115 miles north-east of Scotland. Tugboats then towed the 24,000-tonne platform on a barge up the River Tees to the Able UK yard. The Brent Delta was one of the first platforms to be built in the early days of Britain’s oil and gas industry.</p>
<h2 class="noindent"><b>WARREN BUFFETT: DO NOT IGNORE WHISTLEBLOWERS</b></h2><p class="noindent">At the Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting in May, Warren Buffett said ignoring whistleblowing was a “huge error” that led to the accounts scandal at Wells Fargo, one of his largest investments. More than 5,000 salespeople set up around 2 million fake accounts to meet high-pressure internal goals but the bank dismissed warnings about the fraudulent accounts from employees who had called its ethics hotline between 2011 and 2016. Buffett said: “At some point if there’s a major problem, the CEO gets wind of it. And the CEO has to act.”</p>
<h2 class="noindent"><b>PARIS CLIMATE ACCORD: WHAT NEXT?</b></h2><p class="noindent">As senior government officials from almost 200 nations met in Bonn to work on detailed rules for the Paris Agreement, 214 institutional investors with more than $15trn of assets under management urged governments to implement the climate accord. Following US threats to pull out, California Public Employees Retirement System and other pension funds from Sweden to Australia said “mitigation of climate change is essential for the safeguarding of our investments”. On 28 July, Al Gore’s An Inconvenient Sequel: Truth to Power is released in the US.</p>
<h2 class="noindent"><b>INNOVATE FINANCE HAS A NEW CHAIR</b></h2><p class="noindent">As Sky News revealed, ex-Financial Ombudsman Service boss Natalie Ceeney will be the new chair at Innovate Finance. The not-for-profit organisation set up in 2014 to promote the fintech sector, which lists Deloitte among its members, aims to maintain its position as “a single point of access to help create a global financial services sector that is more sustainable, more inclusive and better for everyone”. Not a simple task when you have EU negotiator Guy Verhofstadt making noise about the rights of EU citizens in the UK and vice versa.</p>
<h2 class="noindent"><b>CHINESE GROWTH</b></h2><p class="noindent">As reported in the FT, Geely, the Chinese industrial group that owns Swedish carmaker Volvo Cars, has moved into international financial services by agreeing to buy almost a third of Saxo Bank, one of Denmark’s biggest. Geely will acquire about 30% of the bank from co-founder and former chief executive Lars Christensen, as well as other investors. “It is simply a way to establish a presence in a segment that they think is going to grow fast, both in Europe and China,” a person familiar with the deal said. It was reported in March that Volvo Cars hopes to raise about $500m from Chinese investors as it prepares for a possible stock market listing.</p>
<h2 class="noindent"><b>PWC HIRES AL BOSS</b></h2><p class="noindent">PwC has appointed Euan Cameron to the newly created role of UK artificial intelligence leader. Cameron said: “Different industries are adopting robotic process automation (RPA) and AI at varying rates but with the field developing so rapidly, those who wait could miss out on the myriad positive opportunities it will bring.” Jon Andrews, head of technology and investments at PwC added: “Technology is essential to the success of our firm and we now employ over 1,500 technology specialists in the UK alone. Our ambition is that we’ll continue to grow our revenues from technology-related areas – including AI, cyber security, data analytics and fintech.”</p>
<h2 class="noindent"><b>£70M</b></h2><p class="noindent">According to The Telegraph newspaper, television presenter Noel Edmonds is seeking £70m in compensation from Lloyds Banking Group relating to the HBOS fraud scandal. Edmonds argues that HBOS and its former employee, Mark Dobson, were behind the collapse of his business Unique Group 10 years ago. In a letter to the Lloyds chief executive, António Horta-Osório, his lawyers allege that he “suffered immense economic loss” and “distress and inconvenience” at the hands of the Reading branch of HBOS.</p>
<h2 class="noindent"><b>HOLDING OUT FOR A HERO</b></h2><p class="noindent">Superhero movies are everywhere, and they’re box office gold. According to Fortune, Disney and Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 brought in $145m in one weekend when it opened at 4,347 locations domestically. And in major foreign markets including Korea, Russia and China, its weekend total was around $269m. In the next year there’s also Wonder Woman, Spider-Man: Homecoming, Thor: Ragnarok, Justice League, Deadpool 2, Black Panther, Bloodshot and Avengers: Infinity War. Escapism is in demand, it would seem.</p>

<p class="noindent">“The fact that reptiles and amphibians are solar-powered means their bodies require only 10% of the energy that mammals of a similar size require. At a time when we are becoming increasingly concerned about the way in which we get our energy from the environment and the wasteful way in which we use it, maybe there are things we can learn from Life in Cold Blood”</p>
