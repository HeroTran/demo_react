<h2 class="noindent"><b>DOWNGRADING FINANCE MANAGEMENT COUNTER-PRODUCTIVE, IZZA TELLS HAMMOND</b></h2><p class="noindent">ICAEW has taken the outgoing government to task for reneging on its commitment to improving financial management across the UK government.</p>
<p>In a hard-hitting blog, ICAEW CEO Michael Izza describes chancellor Philip Hammond’s decision to move the comparatively new role of director general of spending and finance out of the Treasury at a time when strong financial leadership is needed more than ever, as “counter-productive”.</p>
<p>Four years ago, the then chief secretary to the Treasury accepted ICAEW’s call for strong financial management at the top of government contained in its paper, CFO at the Cabinet Table. But the apparent downgrading of the DG role is tantamount to a U-turn.</p>
<p>“I still maintain government needs a CFO at the top table,” Izza says. “The task facing the incoming chancellor when it comes to balancing the books will be enormous. Having a qualified accountant with strong financial leadership skills at the top would help government instil financial disciplines across Whitehall, provide strategic advice to policymakers on key financial policy decisions, strengthen standards, improve balance sheet management and drive value for money across government.”</p>
<h2 class="noindent"><b>A MANIFESTO FOR SMALL BUSINESS</b></h2><p class="noindent">Small businesses are best placed to build an economy that works for everyone around the UK, says the Small Business Taskforce, but they cannot do it without the support of the incoming government.</p>
<p>In its manifesto for small business, the taskforce – which comprises 14 organisations, including ICAEW and Enterprise Nation, and represents over two million small businesses – has come up with six key recommendations “to build a positive and progressive business case for Britain”.</p>
<p>The new government needs to recognise the positive and powerful role small businesses play in the UK and appoint a small business minister to champion their interests. It must provide a taxation system that encourages business investment and growth through stability, is simple to understand and administer, and puts the needs of business first when it comes to making tax digital.</p>
<p>The business support it provides must be collaborative and add value. Suggestions include championing public/private partnerships in business support, launching export vouchers, reinstatement of the Spaces for Growth programme, and establishing a single site for all engagement between government and SMEs.</p>
<p>The taskforce also wants the government to provide a pensions and benefits system that supports when needed, procurement opportunities that work for all, and last, but by no means least, a workforce that is equipped for enterprise. </p>
<h2 class="noindent"><b>BUSINESS OPTIMISM INCREASING</b></h2><p class="noindent">Confidence among UK businesses has increased for the first time in a year but they remain reluctant to make long-term growth plans, according to ICAEW’s latest Business Confidence Monitor (BCM).</p>
<p>In the second quarter of the year, business optimism moved into positive territory to 6.7 from -8.7 in Q1. This increase was boosted by the finance and business, utility and manufacturing sectors, which all showed a more positive outlook. Both retail and wholesale remain in negative territory though. This is not surprising, says ICAEW. Given that businesses are expected to pass a portion of rising input costs on to consumers, the largest confidence rises were always likely to rest with those companies that sit further away from direct contact with consumers.</p>
<p>This trend will continue for the rest of 2017, it predicts, because household incomes look set to be squeezed further in coming months. The problem stems from input prices, which have been rising at more than double the pace of last year. As a result, businesses have been trying to control costs by capping wage growth to below inflation. But the announcement of the general election as well as the upcoming Brexit negotiations has also led to businesses putting recruitment and wage growth on hold.</p>
<h2 class="noindent"><b>COMPUTER-BASED STARS</b></h2><p class="noindent">Not content with coming top in just one of their professional level exams, two candidates have been placed first in two papers each. Heather Brown, training with PwC in St Albans, took first place and the Railton prize in business strategy and first place and the Howitt prize in financial management. Her achievement was matched by that of Harriet Baker, a trainee with Deutsche Bank in Ingatestone, who came top in audit and assurance and financial accounting and reporting, winning the Watts and Spicer Pegler prizes as well.</p>
<p>Two other PwC trainees took the remaining prizes. Haaris Hayat from Barking came top in tax compliance and won the Knox prize, and Daniel Orchard from Harrow came top in business planning: taxation and won the Little prize.</p>
<p>ICAEW was also celebrating the successful launch of its first ever computer-based exams in audit and assurance and tax compliance. Learning and professional development executive director Mark Protherough said the results were comparable to students who had previously taken the same exam on paper. </p>
