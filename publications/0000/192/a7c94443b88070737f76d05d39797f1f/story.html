<p class="dropcap">For all the headiness about being the youngest president in French history, Emmanuel Macron was right to sound sombre in his first address. He will not know until June’s parliamentary election whether those who support his ideas will win a majority. If they do, it is far from clear that, as an independent as well as a centrist, he has the public support for the reforms he wants to make.</p>
<p>The presidential campaign, particularly the second round when Macron was pitched against Marine Le Pen, was inevitably dominated by themes of migration and the threat of terrorism. But social reforms and the economy will rear up immediately. The risk for Macron is that, like his predecessor François Hollande, he will fail to make the changes on curbing public spending, bringing down unemployment and boosting growth that he says he intends to achieve.</p>
<p>France’s economy is at the moment growing steadily – and yet the sources of potential long term crisis are clear. Since the 2008 crisis, the economy has expanded by about 10% after allowing for inflation, and last year reached 1.1%. Yet growth has been slower than in the UK, Germany or the US, and even last year was below the European average of 1.8%. In the first three months of 2017, GDP was just 0.3% higher than in the final quarter of 2016.</p>
<p>But more than growth, it is unemployment that has plagued politicians. After the crisis, it jumped from more than 7% to more than 9%, and despite the best efforts of Hollande, climbed above 10% and stayed there.</p>
<p>Macron may now benefit from the steps Hollande took: tax credits to reduce the cost of employing people, new training initiatives, and most controversially, making hiring and firing easier.</p>
<p>Yet even if the training measures (in particular) begin to chip away at the headline figure, there is little sign Hollande did enough to change the deep, long-term problems. Like Japan, France’s labour market is divided starkly into two: those in full employment with a rich panoply of rights and protections, and those on contracts who lack such assurance. Even though employers are hiring more, they are preferring to do so through short-term contracts, giving the young employed few ways to break into long-term jobs.</p>
<p>Macron may benefit, too, from Hollande’s most dramatic U-turn: grudgingly agreeing late in his tenure to try to trim back public spending and raise taxes, with a view to improving the stubborn deficits and debt. Macron has made clear he has little time for, as he sees it, the unnecessarily heavy commitments and taxation of the French state. Yet as in other mature economies with ageing populations, France is seeing the bills for health and pensions rising steadily; its public spending amounts to an eye watering 57% of GDP, one of the highest levels among industrialised countries.</p>
<p>Again, Hollande made some slight progress in the later part of his tenure, although it did nothing to improve his popularity. It is no easy task to take the job further as Macron has vowed to do. A recent European Commission report argued for cutting public spending and easing taxes on business – but neither are popular to say the least.</p>
<p>Macron is, in the eyes of many outside France and including many in Brussels, advocating the measures that the economy needs. Indeed, Hollande seemed converted to such ideas late in the day. But Macron may be arguing for something that the French public does not yet want to embrace – and recent growth may even weaken support.</p>
<p>If Macron fails to make such changes, he would hardly be the first. But the consequences might be worse than they were for the Hollande years. Those have produced a centrist radical, mainly famed for being the largely unknown founder of a new party – and young. The backlash could be to convince the many people who found Marine Le Pen’s message powerfully attractive to give her ideas another go in five years’ time.</p>
