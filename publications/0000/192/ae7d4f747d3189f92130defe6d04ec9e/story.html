<h2 class="noindent"><b>HOW I CHANGED CAREER</b></h2><p class="noindent">There’s a picture of me at four years old with a Chester Zoo cap on by the sea lion pool. As a child I visited many times, during school trips and with my family. We had 1.9 million visitors last year so it makes a huge contribution to the local economy. I saw the job come up and applied straight away.</p>
<p>It was a shock coming from a demanding corporate environment. The first few days I couldn’t work out why everyone was smiling at me. I’ve worked out now it’s because they love working here.</p>
<p>Before I came here I wouldn’t say I was a massive animal person (I had a cat) and not that interested in conservation, but when you get here and get involved, it draws you in. I probably spend more time watching nature documentaries now than my husband appreciates. He did call me an animal geek the other day.</p>
<p>Some days it is all hands on deck, like in the run-up to the opening of our Islands project (a £40m programme to recreate the exotic isles of south-east Asia), and some days you can watch a baby giraffe being born on CCTV, which is just amazing. You can get involved in the minutiae of marketing campaigns, and then one of the elephants will have a baby and everyone stops and thinks, that’s just the most marvellous thing. But it can go the other way as well. A couple of years ago we lost two of our elephants due to a herpes virus. It’s horrible. The whole mood around the place just drops. But on the back of it we are fundraising for research into finding a cure. You can see where the money we generate goes, not just keeping the zoo ticking over.</p>
<p>I enjoy engaging with the visitors when walking around. They usually just want to know directions to the orangutans or something but it’s good to chat about their day and what they’ve been enjoying. Then someone will walk around the corner and come towards you with a bucket of leeches. </p>

</div></div><h2 class="noindent"><b>MY RESPONSIBILITIES</b></h2><p class="noindent">I’m primarily responsible for finance and IT. I have a team of around 35 people. I spend a lot of time looking at budgets, forecasts and capital expenditure. Over this winter alone we will have spent around £10m on capital projects, £7m of it animal related. We’re currently working on our 15-year development plan for the estate and zoo.</p>
<p>We’re a charity, governed by a board of trustees who oversee what we’re doing and we have an executive board I sit on. We’re totally reliant on visitors. We’ve got 90,000 members who have an annual pass. It’s a very collaborative place to work. I’m responsible for finance and we’re constantly involved in projects that involve different teams. It is very broad. There are over 30 departments – we’ve got vets, marketing, social scientists, retail, catering, maintenance, lots of contractors. It’s like a small town, really.</p>

<h2 class="noindent"><b><b>MY TYPICAL DAY</b></b></h2><p class="noindent">The alarm goes off at 6am. I work four days a week – I have a child at nursery so I try to get everything organised for her. We leave at around 7.30am. First thing I do when I get in is check the weather and visitor number forecasts. My day can vary quite a bit. It could be very formal with one of our board of trustees meetings. That will mean lots of presentations, strategy issues, discussion around projects. Some days I’ll spend talking to the FDs of other charitable zoos. Some days it’s reviewing payroll or accounts or work with the marketing team or IT. On others it’s wearing a hard hat and wellies on a building site. I finish around 5pm and dash home to get my daughter. She’s just at the age where she’s getting interested in the zoo. Although I did ask her what mummy does at the zoo and she said: “Drives a bus.”</p>
<h2 class="noindent"><b>THE CHALLENGES I'VE OVERCOME</b></h2><p class="noindent">Keeping up with growth. We’ve grown quite significantly over the last five years. We have a very dynamic team who have lots of ideas and want to try new things. It’s about making sure our systems can cope. There are a lot of very clever people here but few have a financial background. I have a minor obsession with weather as it effects the number of people who come through the gates. But we have put a lot of work into attracting people to come here out of season with things like our Winter Walk. We focus on improving our income stream year-round so we don’t have huge seasonal peaks and troughs. We are open 363 days a year. We have had The Secret Life of The Zoo series on Channel 4, which has been very successful. They’re yet to do a finance special on VAT partial exemption, but you never know!</p>

<h2 class="noindent"><b><b>INDUSTRY QUIRKS</b></b></h2><p class="noindent">Changing legislation is an issue. We have some interesting debates around Brexit. It may make people stay home, it may bring us more visitors from overseas. It may pose some challenges in terms of staff. It may have some impact on our ability to move some animals between different countries. A question I often get asked is: “How much do you pay for animals? What’s the value on the balance sheet and how do you depreciate them?” We don’t buy animals. Most of our animals are part of European or worldwide breeding programmes. For each different species there will be a co-ordinator across zoos who will decide where the animals can move to for breeding purposes. So Brexit could increase the amount of regulation we have to consider.</p>
<h2 class="noindent"><b>HOW THE ACA HELPED MY CAREER</b></h2><p class="noindent">It makes you think. I trained as an auditor, which makes you probe and consider possibilities. It gives you a very good technical grounding. It’s been a long time since I’ve had my head in the books but if someone brings me a proposal I can still do it. It also gives you a feel for when things don’t look right. Starting at PwC also gave me exposure to people at board level at an early stage of my career.</p>
<h2 class="noindent"><b>THE HABITS OF AN ACCOUNTANT</b></h2><p class="noindent">We drink a lot of tea. We’re fairly organised. I love a to-do list. We probably have a reputation for being miserable, the ones who say no. I like to think I don’t say no without a good reason. ○</p>
