<p class="dropcap">One smart move open to investors is to choose an investment vehicle whose costs will eat up less of their income. According to data from Numis Securities, the average UK wealth manager charges 1.8% a year. The lower fees offered by some challenger brands could considerably extend the life of a pension pot.</p>
<p>Research by Netwealth shows that an investor aged 65 with a portfolio valued at £650,000 who chose to draw down £35,000 a year should expect to see their money last 24 years. But by selecting a more modern wealth management service, with all-in annual fees of around 0.8%, the money should last for 28 years.</p>
<p>Investors who start earlier could achieve an even longer retirement in comfort. For instance, a saver who invests a £250,000 pot at age 45, goes on to contribute a total of £700 gross a month until age 65 and then retires with an income of £35,000 a year, should expect the money to last 24 years with a traditional wealth manager. By using a more cost-effective, modern investment manager, however, they should secure their income for 40 years – an additional 16 years of income.</p>
<p>For an inexperienced investor, while the difference in annual charges might appear to be relatively small, it’s quite an eye-opener to realise it could provide them with an extra 10 years or more of comfortable retirement.</p>
<p>Challenger investment services, such as Netwealth, are able to keep costs down by combining the services of qualified advisers and experienced investment managers with modern technology. Netwealth dispenses with the extraneous aspects of a traditional service such as wood-panelled rooms, banks of salespeople and golf days, which drive up costs to the detriment of the end investor.</p>
<p>The effect of low charges could be even more powerful if used with other strategies for sustainable saving. An investor could choose to draw down a little less income every year, or to adjust drawdown regularly to reflect the changing value of the pension pot.</p>
<p>Netwealth also recommends that investors ask their wealth manager for the full details on fees – since often the all-in total cost is not fully disclosed – as well as understanding where their money is being invested. This includes looking at how diversified the investments are and ensuring the level of risk is appropriate to an individual’s financial goals.</p>
