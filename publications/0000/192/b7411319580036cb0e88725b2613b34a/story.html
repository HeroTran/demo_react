<p class="noindent"><b>1988:</b> Adam Crozier began his career as a management trainee with Mars UK before working in sales at Telegraph Newspapers. His big break came at Saatchi &amp; Saatchi where, aged 26, he became the youngest board member ever.</p>
<p class="noindent"><b>2000:</b> He joined the FA as CEO where he modernised the institution, increased revenue and brought in a non-English coach. Ruffling too many feathers there, he moved to the Royal Mail in 2003.</p>

<p class="noindent"><b>2010:</b> Rewarded handsomely for modernising (that word again) the Royal Mail, Crozier moved into media. As CEO of ITV he diversified a business reliant on advertising, steering it towards more involvement in making and selling hit shows to other broadcasters and buying independent producers in Britain and overseas.</p>
<p class="noindent"><b>2017:</b> Stepping down this month to pursue a portfolio career, he says ITV is well placed for the digital future.</p>
