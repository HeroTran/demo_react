<p class="dropcap">When Paula Sussex, chief executive of the Charity Commission, spoke at ICAEW’s Annual Dinner in March this year, she praised members for their contribution to the sector (one in five chartered accountants are volunteers) but she also flagged a problem. The public’s trust and confidence in charities has, for various reasons, been significantly shaken recently. Supporting the good governance and stewardship of charities via the role of trustee or treasurer is, she said, “needed now more than ever”.</p>
<p>The public could be reassured, said Sussex, if they were to see higher standards for raising and managing money, a clear explanation from the charity about what it does, and practical examples of what a difference the charity is making to its cause. Step forward Jo Hunter, who applies her financial, commercial and administrative skills to two charities – as co-founder and honorary treasurer of Smart Works and chair of Action for Stammering Children – and speaks articulately about how she dedicates her time to both.</p>
<p>Even though she left the profession a couple of decades ago (to raise her family and do some tax and consultancy work) Hunter says she still has PwC – “a fantastic organisation” – coursing through her veins. She studied economics and social sciences at university (her interest in business inspired by her entrepreneurial father) and joined the Big Four firm in 1982 to gain a professional qualification.</p>
<p>She speaks fondly of her time there – she still has many friends from that early 1980s intake – and can’t emphasise enough how influential it was. “I loved audit, the experience of meeting people and the variety of industries and companies,” she recalls. “It’s stood me in such good stead for everything else I’ve done since: that variety and the discipline of the training, which I think is second to none.”</p>
<p>Asked to pick out the skills she acquired as a novice that she relies upon most now, she chooses the rigour of the training. Corporate governance failings could spell disaster for a charity and the disciplined thinking of a chartered accountant is defence against them. “I’m very keen on following the rules, that part of the training lives with you forever,” she explains. “You might not remember section something-or-other, but you do think, ‘hang on, this is a question I should ask’. You never know all the answers but you know when to ask the questions,” she says. Managing conflicts of interest, making reasonable decisions, ensuring financial controls are effective – all of those are second nature.</p>
<p>The confidence she gained as an eager young accountant wasn’t as long-lasting. She had cut her teeth in the 1980s when “in honesty, it was quite a tough environment for a woman. Very exciting and fun, a bit crazy, but quite male-dominated. A very different place to how it is now.” After quite a few years out of the workplace doing consultancy work, she found she wasn’t as self-assured. “It happens to a lot of women at that stage, I think. As more time went by I thought, ‘I’m never going to be able to go back to a full-time job because I’m out of date’. I just thought, ‘I’m a mother, I can’t do it anymore’.”</p>
<p>Call it serendipity, synchronicity, what you will, Hunter found herself involved in an organisation that helped the type of person she identified with. Dress for Success was an American non-profit set up to help women get back into the workplace by providing professional attire and support (in interviewing skills, for example). It had an affiliate base in London, where a friend of Hunter’s needed some help with a funding application. By the end of the week. “I told her I’d never done a set of charity accounts, and didn’t think I could. But then I thought, if someone’s desperate then I am doing a favour, so I did the accounts, we did the funding application together and we were successful.”</p>
<p>That favour led to Hunter working for Dress for Success on a more permanent basis. Not for the last time during this interview, her recollection of what a difference a charity can make comes emotionally charged. She recalls a client waiting in reception who couldn’t make eye contact and “looked downtrodden and miserable. She went into the dressing room and came back a completely different person. I thought, someone has sprinkled fairy dust over her. She was totally different, she now had confidence and self-esteem to get a job. It was then that I got it, the magic of this place.”</p>
<p>The London affiliate became one of the most successful in the worldwide organisation and, because it wanted to expand its dressing sessions and one-on-one support to women regionally, chair Juliet Hughes-Hallett and treasurer Hunter broke away from the American organisation and rebranded as a UK-based charity. Four years later, with CEO Kate Stephens on board, it now operates in Edinburgh, Manchester, Birmingham, Reading and, of course, London, and has been shortlisted for the Charity Awards 2017.</p>

<span class="hide">"</span></blockquote>
<p>Hunter’s not surprised by how successful Smart Works has become – “it’s a very good business model, volunteer-led with all clothes donated”. It has supported 7,000 women and she is proud of its success rate: “Sixty per cent go on to get the job and 40% of them are lone parents, so these are people who’ve struggled; 25% have been unemployed for more than three years. They’ve been to a lot of interviews but they’re virtually giving up at this point. And then they’re referred to us.”</p>
<p class="dropcap">The magic is conjured by collaboration between the private sector and volunteers (of which there is a waiting list). The former provides the high-quality interview clothes, the latter provide the styling advice and interview training. Hunter says: “The donated clothes are either from City corporates, companies like Barclays or PwC, which run clothing drives for us. Or retailers such as Hobbs or Whistles give us end-of-line stock. I’d say about 40% of our clothes are new but they’re all high quality clothes. The staff that do the dressing are highly-trained volunteers – it’s not just about being a stylist, it’s about having empathy with clients – and then we get HR professionals to do one-to-one interview coaching, which can be tailored to their needs and the job they’re going to.”</p>
<p>You could think of it as an intervention, says Hunter: “It’s a particular moment in their lives, they’ve got a job interview and we give them that helping hand to get over the finishing line. In 90 minutes, really, you can transform somebody’s life. They come to us from prisons, homeless charities, job centres. We ask for a referral so we know they need our service, that they’re ready to get the job.”</p>
<p>And the charity’s direction is unlikely to change, says Hunter. Its success rate is high, and “we have decided we should really concentrate on what we’re good at and not be tempted to deviate from our core service. We’re not going to grow too fast because that’s risky and you can damage your brand or reduce the quality of your service. We’re proud of everything we’ve achieved so it would be terrible to stretch ourselves too thin or open up too quickly in areas that don’t need us.” She adds: “Each UK centre has opened up as an independent charity, so each needs a dynamic chair; board members to drive it through. It’s hard work and you need to have the time, energy and vision. It’s a particular skillset so we’re careful who we work with.”</p>
<p>They’re frugal, too, especially in what is a difficult fundraising climate. “We do need to generate money, we have to pay the rent and the salaries. But we have no other costs, we’re a very lean machine in that respect,” she says with her PwC hat on. “While it’s a simple model when it’s working well, to start it up is hard work. And success is never straightforward to replicate. There are issues we might not even have thought about.”</p>
<p>But don’t get her wrong, it’s not a complete world of pain. In fact, she says, she and Hughes-Hallett agreed on the importance of enjoying their work. “Juliet was brought in [to Dress for Success] by the same friend. I used to go in on a Tuesday to do my treasury work and she was there dressing, so we formed a connection. When she became chair we kind of ran it together, we’re yin and yang. She has fantastic energy and ideas, a background in fashion [she worked at Vogue] and is outward-going, and I’m there with my radar thinking, what are the risks? But she has always said, ‘every day has got to be fun’. And it has been. I do this on a voluntary basis because I want to give back but also it’s nice to have fun while you’re doing it.”</p>
<p>Hunter is equally passionate about Action for Stammering Children (ASC), which on the face of it is a completely different kettle of fish to Smart Works, but actually has a similar goal: to help give confidence back. Our interview takes place at the Michael Palin Centre for Stammering Children, to which the actor gave his name following his role in A Fish Called Wanda, where he portrayed the memorable, stammering Ken (Palin’s father also suffered from stammering all his life). As Hunter recalls, ASC was looking for a treasurer in her mould. Her, basically. But she simply couldn’t see how she had time to fit them in. “I met some of the therapists anyway and they showed me a video of Michael Palin talking about the children and handed me the tissue box. Streaming with tears I said: ‘OK, I’ll help you’. I was interviewed, I got the treasury job and I just fell in love with it.”</p>
<p>It’s not difficult to see why the tears and why the love. The charity provides specialist assessments and therapy for stammering children, and it also funds the training of speech and language therapists and research. As a parent, Hunter knows how difficult it can be to raise a child. But to raise a child where stammering, a severe communication disability that frequently becomes a focus for teasing and bullying, is involved, is even more so. “I was treasurer for six years, I think, and when the chair retired I was asked to take it over. I’m the only one on the board that doesn’t have a direct connection with stammering, but I’m so passionate about it now. I absolutely love this charity.”</p>
<p class="dropcap">Although it has a stellar group of trustees and supporters (as well as Palin, The King’s Speech star Colin Firth and Ed Balls are also vice presidents), the charity still struggles with fundraising and Hunter falls back on her training often.</p>
<p>“Fundraising is a massive challenge,” she says, “and we’re more reliant on trusts and foundations here. It’s tough. It’s a niche condition, it’s relatively low incidence (about 150,000 children) but has such a high impact. Getting that message across is harder [than Smart Works] so we’ve got a bigger job in that respect. But I enjoy the challenge and I’ve enjoyed moving from the treasurer to the chair role, although I had to let go of my spreadsheets.”</p>
<p>Busy as she is, I wonder whether she has considered following in her father’s footsteps and starting her own business – she has the contacts, the wisdom. “That’s a good question. If anything, I’d start up my own charity. I don’t think I’d go back into the business world now. The people you meet in the charity sector are inspirational; so many are doing things in their free time. Everyone’s working hard and I love that. This is more rewarding.”</p>
<p>She’s equally effusive about the ACA, and feels she wouldn’t be doing something she loves so much without it. “I’m so grateful for it; it’s enabled me to do something that I’m passionate about and I can give something back and it’s useful. I married an accountant, he’s still at PwC, and I’m going to have an accountant for a son (he’s training at Deloitte). I think it’s a fabulous career,” she says.</p>
<p>On our way out of the Michael Palin Centre, we pass a therapist helping a young child. I catch Hunter’s eye and quickly say my goodbyes. I haven’t got any tissues, you see.</p>
