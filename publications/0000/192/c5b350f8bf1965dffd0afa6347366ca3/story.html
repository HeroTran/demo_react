<p class="noindent"><b>BANK REGULATORY RATIOS</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Following extensive consultation with banks, auditors and regulators, ICAEW has published its long-awaited framework for assuring bank regulatory ratios, the crucial regulatory metrics used to measure the stability of financial institutions. Bank Regulatory Ratios: ICAEW Assurance Framework is applicable to all regulatory ratios, including capital, liquidity and leverage, and is intended to deliver confidence in the key measures of resilience. It is also applicable to other businesses facing prudential regulation, such as investment firms, and can be applied worldwide.</p>
<p>The framework sets out a number of overarching principles for providing robust assurance while allowing flexibility to apply it to most risk types whether operational, credit or liquidity risk.</p>

<p class="noindent"><b>AUDITORS AND PRELIMINARY ANNOUNCEMENTS</b></p>
<p class="noindent">The Financial Reporting Council (FRC) has issued a discussion paper about the use and value of preliminary announcements in the UK and the role of the auditor in relation to them, as part of the revision of its current auditor guidance.</p>
<p>Preliminary results are usually based on audited information, although a minority of companies do publish preliminaries based on unaudited information. Some listed entities have been moving towards the simultaneous publication of annual results in “preliminary” form alongside the statutory financial statements.</p>
<p>The FRC has discovered through its stakeholder engagement that there appears to be “limited understanding” of the auditor’s current role when agreeing to the publication of preliminaries. As a result, it has identified a range of options to provide greater clarity. One proposed option requires audits to be complete and the auditor’s report on the underpinning statutory financial statements to be signed before preliminary results can be released. The FRC is keen to hear from respondents with suggestions of other innovative ideas or emerging practice.</p>
<p>Deadline for comments is 23 June 2017.</p>

<p class="noindent"><b>CHARITY AUDITORS' AND EXAMINERS' GUIDANCE</b></p>
<p class="noindent">The three charity regulators (England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland) have come up with revised joint guidance for auditors and independent examiners on reporting matters of material significance. They have added two new areas of reporting to the list of matters of material significance. The first covers when an auditor has concerns about a charity’s accounts and issues a modified audit opinion report or qualified independent examiner’s report. The second covers when an auditor has concerns that conflicts of interest or related party transactions have not been properly managed or declared.</p>
<p>The three have also removed one matter from the list, which had led to auditors and independent examiners telling the regulators when they had simply ceased to hold office. When there are reportable matters involved in their resignation, this is covered by an alternative matter.</p>
<p>Commenting on the revised guidance, Nigel Davies, head of accountancy services at the Charity Commission for England and Wales, said that it has become clear that not all auditors and examiners had been reporting matters to the regulators. “We hope that by providing an updated list auditors and examiners may be clearer in their duties. We urge auditors and examiners to read this updated list of matters which has been informed by our regulatory work to report and continue to report these serious issues to the regulators.”</p>

<p class="noindent"><b>IAASB UPDATES FINANCIAL ESTIMATES AUDITS</b></p>
<p class="noindent">The International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB) wants to implement significant changes that would require auditors – in particular, auditors of financial institutions – to “sharpen their focus” on risks of material misstatements arising from accounting estimates.</p>
<p>Among the proposed changes are: enhanced requirements for risk assessment procedures to include specific factors, such as complexity, judgment and estimation uncertainty, that are related to accounting estimates; a more detailed expectation for the auditor’s response to identified risks, including augmenting the auditor’s application of professional scepticism; and, critically, applicable regardless of the size and sector of the business or audit firm.</p>
<p>The deadline for comments on Auditing Accounting Estimates and Related Disclosures is 1 August 2017.</p>

<p class="noindent"><b>PEOPLE WITH SIGNIFICANT CONTROL RULES CHANGE</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Changes to the anti-money laundering rules, designed to increase the transparency of who owns and controls companies in the UK, come into operation from 26 June. They will affect the information companies need to provide about people with significant control (PSC).</p>
<p>The changes include a new requirement to inform Companies House whenever there is a change in PSC (companies will have 14 days to update their register and another 14 to send the information to Companies House) and a tightening of the rules relating to companies that are currently exempt from requirements to hold information about their PSC.</p>
<p>Also, from 24 July, both active Scottish limited partnerships and general Scottish partnerships where all the partners are corporate bodies will have to register PSC information with Companies House. They will be able to apply for a restriction so that the information is not published on the public register. Currently the only bodies entitled to access this information are specified public authorities, but the new AML legislation will extend the list to credit and financial institutions because they carry out customer due diligence.</p>

<p class="noindent"><b>GOVERNMENT GOLD PLATES AML LEGISLATION</b></p>
<p class="noindent">ICAEW has accused the Treasury of gold plating the draft regulations implementing the EU Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Directive into UK law. This is particularly so when it comes to client due diligence. It says that rather than taking a balanced, risk-based approach, firms will be required to find out and verify a large amount of information about corporate clients event though much of it will be of questionable usefulness.</p>
<p>It points to the requirement, under draft regulation 28(3), for firms to get hold of the company’s memorandum of association. This, it says, is likely to prove onerous, not to mention useless in preventing or detecting money laundering since many articles of association will be largely identical as they are based on the model articles in company legislation. It also thinks the wording of the regulation could be interpreted to mean firms are required to verify the identity of not just the board of a client but senior management as well.</p>
<p>ICAEW also takes the Treasury to task over the requirement for companies to respond to due diligence requests within two working days. This is gold plating, it says, that is entirely unreasonable and puts all UK companies, as well as firms, at a major competitive disadvantage compared to their overseas peers. “If an obligated entity has difficulty obtaining client due diligence information then that informs a risk-based judgement on continuation of the relationship.”</p>
<p>Some of the regulations go way beyond the directive: for instance, the directive requires information on beneficial ownership to be held by trustees and submitted to a central register. But the regulations “significantly” widen the information required.</p>
<p>ICAEW describes regulation 44 as a “disproportionate measure with a questionable purpose. It is unclear what providing details of legal, financial, tax or other advisers has to do with fighting money laundering and terrorist financing. ‘Other advice’ could presumably cover an extremely broad range of commercial services. Additionally, 44(4)(c) requires accounts and valuation of assets. It is unclear what is meant by valuation nor is there any consideration for the fact that many trusts don’t prepare accounts.”</p>
<p>Other issues include the definition of a politically exposed person, which is wider than the directive’s, a general lack of clarity, the government approach to all non-casino gambling businesses as low risk, the cost to ICAEW members of the Disclosure and Barring Service checks and the overly tight implementation timetable.</p>

<p class="noindent"><b>CRIMINAL FINANCES ACT 2017</b></p>
<p class="noindent">The Criminal Finances Act 2017 will give law enforcement agencies and partners more powers to recover the proceeds of crime, tackle money laundering, tax evasion and corruption, and combat the financing of terrorism.</p>
<p>Its provisions introduce unexplained wealth orders, which will be used to require those suspected of serious crime or corruption to explain the sources of their wealth, and criminal charges against companies for failing to prevent their staff from facilitating tax evasion. They enable the seizure and forfeiture of proceeds of crime and terrorist money stored in bank accounts and certain personal or moveable items such as precious metals and stones and works of art.</p>
<p>The Act also provides legal protections for the sharing of information between regulated companies and extends the time period granted to law enforcement agencies to investigate suspicious transactions. It extends disclosure orders to cover money laundering and terrorist finance investigations, and it extends the existing civil recovery regime in the Proceeds of Crime Act to allow for the recovery of the proceeds of gross human rights abuses or violations overseas.</p>

<p class="noindent"><b>NEW FORMS OF BUSINESS</b></p>
<p class="noindent">A new paper from ICAEW considers the development of different legal forms of business over the centuries and asks whether or not the existing approach, both domestically and internationally, is sustainable.</p>
<p>In doing so, Future Enterprise: Assessing Forms of Business considers social and technological developments , including blockchain, and how these might make new approaches possible. “For instance,” it suggests, “we might permit individuals to benefit from limited liability without the need to incorporate a limited liability company – something the Office of Tax Simplification, in its small company taxation review of March 2016, advised the UK government to consider.”</p>
<p>The paper also outlines some of the key issues that would need to be considered if the new approaches were taken forward.</p>

<p class="noindent"><b>AML SUPERVISORY REGIME - ICAEW COMMENTS</b></p>
<p class="noindent">The government’s proposals for an anti-money laundering (AML) oversight regime, combined with deregulation of the gambling sector, raise serious questions about its appreciation of where the greatest risks lie in the UK’s fight against money laundering and terrorist financing and the direction it has taken in addressing both, ICAEW says.</p>
<p>In a hard-hitting response to the Treasury’s call for further information on the supervisory regime, it warns that the proposals for an AML oversight body to bring consistency in supervision across sectors will fail because it does not include oversight of all the supervisors across the accountancy sector, let alone multiple sectors. In fact, it puts greater distance between private and public sector supervisors than exists now.</p>
<p>The response points out, as an example, that one of the most significant issues for the accountancy sector is the supervision  of individuals and firms that are not members of the prescribed accountancy bodies, who are theoretically regulated by HMRC. “Over the past 10 years, HMRC has struggled to meet the well-established requirements of an effective supervisor, in accordance with FATF (Financial Action Task Force) recommendations. So when a significant number of high-risk ASPs (accountancy service providers), supervised by a constitutionally hobbled supervisor, are excluded from the proposed oversight programme, this merely exacerbates the existing risks and inconsistencies in the current supervisory regime.”</p>
<p>ICAEW also accuses the Treasury of failing to provide an evidence base to justify the purpose and design of the new oversight body, and not providing information as to its costs beyond requiring professional bodies and their membership to fund it.</p>

<p class="noindent"><b>PUBLIC INTEREST, CONFLICTS AND FEES GUIDANCE</b></p>
<p class="noindent">ICAEW has issued three guidance notes designed to help ICAEW members apply those parts of the Ethics Code relating to members’ duties to the public interest, identifying and addressing conflicts of interest, and setting the basis of determining fees. The guidance is in response to questions that arose in the FRC’s disciplinary proceedings against Deloitte in the MG Rover case.</p>
<p>Essentially, the note on the public interest makes it clear that the principal public interest duty rests at the level of the profession itself, and that individual members discharge that duty by following the requirements of the Ethics Code in spirit as well as the letter.</p>
<p>The note on conflicts of interest states that the Code does not ban members from undertaking engagements where different client interests conflict, provided that certain safeguards are applied and informed consent obtained. However, it warns that on some occasions, the threats to objectivity due to a conflict of interests may be of such significance that adequate safeguards cannot be established.</p>
<p>The third note confirms that the Code does not require the amount of a fee to be justified as it is a commercial matter and discusses the key requirements that form the basis of charging fees so that no threat to objectivity arises.</p>

<h2 class="ezoeAlignleft text-left"><b>REPORTING</b></h2><p> </p>
<p class="noindent"><b>GUIDANCE ON DISTRIBUTABLE PROFITS</b></p>
<p class="noindent">ICAEW and ICAS have published new joint guidance (Tech 02/17BL) on realised and distributable profits under the 2006 Companies Act. This is based on TECH02/10, Guidance on the Determination of Realised Profits and Losses in the Context of Distributions under the Companies Act 2006, but takes into account a number of changes since its publication, in particular the introduction of FRS 102.</p>
<p>The application of new or revised standards may lead to changes in the timing and amount of profit recognised. Recent changes to accounting standards do not raise any fundamentally new issues in relation to realised and distributable profits. The guidance represents generally accepted practice at 31 December 2016 in relation to the meaning of realised profit. Both accountancy bodies warn that, while many of the revisions represent principles that were generally accepted prior to this date, “the revisions introduced now should not be used to question the lawfulness of distributions made at an earlier date”.</p>
<p>“Balances on reserves,” they say, “will need to be re-examined in the light of the technical release and the position should be re-assessed before a distribution is made.” They go on to say that additional guidance about the definition of a distribution is based on legal advice. “Therefore, it is possible that some transactions previously entered into were distributions at the time and would have been unlawful in the absence of adequate distributable reserves. For example, this might apply to some intragroup loans on off market terms.”</p>

<p class="noindent"><b>CORPORATE REPORTING IN THE 21ST CENTURY</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Research by ICAEW into the future of corporate reporting has concluded that the conditions for radical change exist but a number of major issues stand in the way. What is needed, it says, is collective agreement among stakeholders on a way forward once and for all if the pace of change is to be accelerated, and broadly in one direction.</p>
<p>In Change &amp; Continuity in Corporate Reporting: a Progress Report, ICAEW found that there is widespread agreement among stakeholders that the quality of narrative and non-financial disclosures in the “front half” of the annual report has improved significantly in the UK in recent years, especially when it comes to the business model, strategy, non-financial key performance indicators and drivers of long-term wealth creation. However, despite much debate about the impact of data analysis on the future of corporate reporting and audit, there has been little progress in developing technology as a corporate reporting tool.</p>
<p>The report concentrated on the “front half” of the report, rather than the quality of the financial statements. However, it made an exception for what is regarded as the “Achilles’ heel” of financial reporting, the accounting and reporting of intangible assets. Attempts to tackle this problem have failed in the past and there is a lack of enthusiasm among standard-setters to try again. Nevertheless, there is appetite among investors for improved measurement. “Few intangibles meet the criteria for recognition on company balance sheets, except in the context of the acquisition of a business, and it was argued that this weakens the extent to which financial reporting can provide a clear picture of a company’s resources to investors and other users of financial reports.” This will only get worse as more businesses are driven by internally generated intangible assets that cannot be recognised in the financial statements.</p>
<p>The interim report is based on a series of Financial Reporting Faculty thought leadership roundtables and meetings. It is not intended as a blueprint for change but  to further the debate about the future of corporate reporting. It will be followed up by another paper in 2018, which will take account of comments on this paper and related outputs and activities.</p>

<p>The changes are in response to comments the standard-setter received about accounting for prepayment options. They are intended to improve the usefulness of information required by the standard about these financial assets.</p>
<p>The implementation date for these changes is the same as the effective date for IFRS 9 – for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018.</p>

<p class="noindent">The International Public Sector Accounting Standards Board is consulting about financial reporting for heritage in the public sector, with a view to reducing the variety of financial reporting practices for heritage items. These are items that are intended to be held indefinitely and preserved for the benefit of present and future generations because of their rarity and or significance.</p>
<p>The consultation paper proposes that heritage items’ special characteristics do not prevent them from being assets for the purposes of financial reporting. In many cases, it says, a monetary value can by assigned and the items should be recognised in the statement of financial position if they meet the recognition criteria in the conceptual framework.</p>

<p class="noindent"><b>FRC TELLS INVESTORS WHAT TO LOOK OUT FOR IN 2017</b></p>
<p class="noindent">FRC chief executive Stephen Haddrill has written to institutional investors ahead of the 2017 shareholder meeting season advising them on what recent developments to look out for in listed companies’ annual reports and accounts. He is also keen to encourage them to engage with companies both “to provide a steer on what information they believe is relevant and to challenge where reporting falls short of expectations”.</p>
<p>Among the areas Haddrill highlights in the letter are alternative performance measures (APMs), which are used to report performance. He points out that this will be the first year the APM guidelines from the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) apply to annual reports, and investors should expect to see disclosures in the strategic report that give a clear and complete understanding of the APMs presented, how they are calculated and why they are useful.</p>
<p>Where relevant, a reconciliation to amounts present in the financial statements should be given.</p>
<p>Companies should also be using the strategic report to explain clearly why they have selected their particular period of assessment for their viability statement, what qualifications and assumptions were made and how the underlying analysis was performed.</p>
<p>The strategic report should make clear the impact of Brexit on the company’s business in the short term. “As the economic and political effects are developed and become more certain in the medium to longer term, we would expect boards to provide increasingly company specific disclosures with, ultimately, quantification of the effects.”</p>
<p>Haddrill says there is room for improvement in the disclosure of accounting policies, particularly in relation to revenue recognition, while companies should be providing information on progress towards implementation of IFRS 15, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, IFRS 9, Financial Instruments, and IFRS 16, Leases.</p>

<h2><b>TAX</b></h2><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="noindent"><b>MTD DROPPED FROM FINANCE ACT</b></p>
<p class="noindent">The government dropped several measures from the Finance Bill in the run-up to the General Election. They included the plans for Making Tax Digital (MTD), changes to corporate loss relief and interest deductibility, as well as VAT related to fulfilment houses and penalties for enablers of defeated tax avoidance schemes. The rest of the Finance Bill was rushed through the House of Commons after four hours of debate.</p>
<p>Anita Monteith, tax manager at ICAEW, said the decision to drop the MTD plans was a “sensible” move. It came less than one week after ICAEW, the Federation of Small Businesses and ACCA joined forces to call for all MTD clauses in the Finance Bill to be removed. “Making Tax Digital plans remain controversial and need more scrutiny by those who will be affected, and most importantly proper parliamentary debate – a clear roadmap as to how MTD will work in practice is needed,” she added. “These seminal clauses and schedule can be reintroduced after the election which will allow more time for proper scrutiny.”</p>
<p>Monteith urged the government to prioritise addressing the detailed questions that have been raised about how MTD will work in practice.</p>
<p>The clauses are likely to return in another Finance Bill following the election.</p>
<p> </p>
<p class="noindent"><b>ICAEW BRIEFING ON DIGITAL RECORD-KEEPING</b></p>
<p class="noindent">As part of ICAEW’s continued efforts to work with government, and before it took MTD out of the Finance Act, the Tax Faculty put together a briefing for MPs on digital reporting and record-keeping for income tax, expressing its concerns about the lack of detail and asking for as many taxpayers as possible to be removed from the scope of self-assessment.</p>
<p>“Although the proposals for MTD have been discussed widely for some time,” the briefing said, “we are still waiting for many of the detailed requirements. For example, it is not clear how MTD will work alongside the existing self-assessment system, how the exemptions will work, what details need to be reported, how amendments will be made, penalties levied and how appeals will operate.”</p>
<p>The faculty also said that it had become clear that most of the legislation for MTD was going to be delegated to secondary legislation and then further to directions. Yet government was expecting both the tax professions and parliament to scrutinise legislation without sight of the complete package.</p>
<p>Since the government remains committed to the digitalisation of the tax system, the faculty suggests that further work should be done to complete the legislative package before bringing it back. “We remain of the opinion that it is a mistake to rush this fundamental change to the administration of UK tax and that removing the mandation requirement would allow IT systems to be built and properly tested, so that businesses could then opt in as it made business sense for them to do so.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p class="noindent"><b>MEPS CLOSE MULTINATIONALS' TAX LOOPHOLES</b></p>
<p class="noindent">The European Parliament has voted overwhelmingly to close loopholes that in the past have been exploited by some multinationals to avoid paying tax. The MEPs amended the EU’s anti-tax avoidance directive to prevent multinationals taking advantage of mismatches between EU and third countries’ tax rules to reduce their tax bills.</p>
<p>“These arrangements are frequently used by the largest companies with the sole purpose of reducing corporate taxation,” said rapporteur Olle Ludvigsson. “We have seen it in both the Apple case and in the McDonald’s case. It is about time these corporations paid their fair share of taxes.”</p>
<p>The amendments now go to the Council of Ministers for final approval. If it gives the go ahead, then corporations established in two jurisdictions (inside and outside the EU) for example, may no longer be able to have the same expenditure deducted from tax in both jurisdictions.</p>
<p>The MEPs are also seeking to end to the practice of having a payment recognised as tax deductible in one jurisdiction but not recognised as taxable income in the other.</p>
