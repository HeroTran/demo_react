<p class="dropcap">Efficient tax collection protects diligent taxpayers from paying taxes on behalf of those who avoid them, while promoting fair competition. In recent years, however, the principle of “paying taxes where profits are made” has failed. Large multinationals have taken advantage of differences in tax systems allowing them to shift profits legally (or less so), erode taxable base and minimise total tax bills. In many cases governments helped them reach a “close-to-zero” effective tax rate.</p>
<p>The tax revenue from company profit is only 10% of total tax revenue, whereas 24% of total tax revenue comes from citizens (OECD average). This plays a significant role in efforts to reduce those taxes with the most negative effect on economic activity, such as tax on wages.</p>
<p>The world’s most developed countries asked the OECD for a solution. The result – BEPS (Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) – was presented in 2015 and should soon be implemented.</p>
<p>Tax policy is a matter of state sovereignty, so coordinated effort in this area is difficult. Yet, despite challenges, the EU has made progress.</p>
<p>Among the achievements is the OECD BEPS-based Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive (ATAD) and the ATAD II, addressing hybrid mismatches with third countries. The new country-by-country reporting rules (CBCR) for large companies promoted transparency, and may soon become public. International cooperation gained momentum through OECD’s automatic exchange of financial information (AEOI), some countries entered AEOI in 2017 and more will follow next year. I consider this rather successful.</p>
<p>The biggest challenges are yet to come. The EU’s proposals for consolidating its Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base (CCCTB) are being negotiated by the EU member states’ finance ministers. The reform of the EU VAT regime expected in the autumn will (if approved) end carousel frauds that significantly contribute to the EU VAT gap of nearly €160bn.</p>
<p>I hope that in the light of recent developments, the member states come to realise the need for such overhaul. The problem with BEPS is clearly a cross-border issue, and joint effort and solutions are the only way towards improvement.</p>
<p>The Czech Republic saw its tax system as an issue of national sovereignty, but realised recently the need to cooperate across the EU. This puts the country on an equal footing with larger member states, helping to tackle cross-border corporate tax issues and also to voice the concerns of smaller open economies.</p>
<p>The CCCTB project can help the economy as it can significantly reduce the cost of tax compliance as well as make taxes fairer and easier to collect.</p>
<p>The Czech Republic also wants to introduce a temporary pilot project that would help minimise VAT carousel frauds before the permanent EU VAT regime is established (no sooner than 2020). Supported by Austria, it called on the Commission to introduce a proposal for temporary derogation that would allow certain member states to introduce a generalised reverse charge mechanism (GRCM).</p>
<p>I appreciate the determination to fight tax fraud, but I am concerned about the frequent changes to the rules for VAT collection before the long-term EU regime is introduced.</p>
<p>Studies show the introduction of a GRCM in a single member state would push carousel fraud out of the Czech Republic to other member states who are trade partners. </p>
<p>The introduction of a GRCM would lead to other types of fraud that are  much harder to tackle. Introducing  another temporary system would put a large bureaucratic burden on Czech businesses, forcing them to maintain parallel domestic VAT regimes (as the GRCM only applies above a certain threshold per invoice).</p>
<p>Czech authorities have a powerful tool to hand that can significantly reduce risk of VAT fraud – information on transactions subject to VAT that is well-tracked in the Czech Republic. Effective and efficient use of data seems to be a better solution.</p>
<p>It seems that EU cooperation in tax matters is still a new area and a trial and error approach is sometimes inevitable. Let us hope that the ultimate outcome will serve a purpose and lead to an EU with fair, transparent tax policies supporting fair market competition, efficient tax collection and healthy public finances.</p>
