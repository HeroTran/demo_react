<td valign="top">  <p class="dropcap">This is a place for taking photos and showing off,” says Xiao Xue, 30, sipping a Starbucks coffee in a branch of the US mega-chain in central Beijing.</p><p>“I think that when Starbucks first entered China they meant to mould the brand into one for proper office workers,” she continues, as a group of young girls sitting around a nearby table giggle and fiddle with their smartphones. “But somehow it’s become a place for young people taking selfies.”</p><p>Starbucks currently has around 2,500 outlets in China – that’s a lot of selfies with mugs of Americano being taken each day. The flood is set to intensify, with the firm announcing last November that it will double the number of venues it has in the country within the next five years, as part of its global plan to open 12,000 further stores in total. The company is expecting a 10% hike in global profit as a result of all the new openings.</p><p>“This is the early chapter of our China growth right now,” Belinda Wong, chief executive of Starbucks’ operations in China, told the South China Morning Post. “We have barely even scratched the surface. There is plenty of space to fill in first and second-tier cities where we have already opened – Beijing, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Shanghai.”</p><p>The Hong Kong-based newspaper called the aggressive expansion plan a “big bet” in China, which is traditionally the land of tea rather than hazelnut lattes. But the steady rise of Starbucks’ popularity in the country since launching there in 1999 suggests that the move is hardly a gamble.</p><p>“In China everything moves fast – it’s difficult for some western companies to understand how quickly and decisively things happen,” says Benji Lamb of the Shanghai-based Gentlemen Marketing Agency. “The scale of investment might seem crazy, but it’s common practice here.”</p><h3>Branding and promotion</h3><p>Indeed, Starbucks’ recent Chinese expansion – it opened 500 new stores in the country in 2015 – has already made China the firm’s top market outside the US. Rivals such as British chain Costa Coffee have followed suit – Costa plans to open 900 more stores in China, bringing its total to around 1,400 by 2020.</p><p>The rise in demand can partly be explained by the rapid modernisation of business culture in China’s largest cities over the past decade. “With urbanisation, the faster pace of life has made coffee more important in consumers’ lives,” says Summer Chen, an analyst at Mintel who wrote the market research company’s recent China coffee industry report. “Tea, on the other hand, is mostly consumed for nourishing, relaxation, or thirst-quenching. We found that the top reason for Chinese consumers to drink coffee was to boost energy.”</p><p>The dominating factor that has made Starbucks such a strong market leader in the coffee shop sector (in 2013, even before its expansion got hyper-aggressive, Euromonitor International said it had a 31.5% share), though, is its marketing strategy, including its branding of the coffee itself and its promotion on social media.</p><p>In the US Starbucks is presented as solid, fun, one-on-every-corner, drink-one-a-day coffee for people within a relatively wide income range. In China it is marketed as a premium product, retailing at prices around 20% higher than those in the US.</p><h3>Place to show off</h3><p>A three-storey Starbucks venue in Sanlitun Village, one of Beijing’s most fashionable and high-end shopping areas, is almost always jam-packed during opening hours.</p><p>“It’s a place for people who have a bit of extra money to spend,” says a 28-year-old banker who gives her name as Katyusha as she enjoys her drink. “It’s a place to show off publicly.”</p><p>“It’s seen as upmarket, even though in reality it’s not – the beans aren’t better [than those used in the US],” says Lamb. “It’s just a case of pricing and branding. People go to Starbucks because of the ‘face’ of it, because of the brand.”</p><p>There does indeed seem to be feverish Chinese appetite for Starbucks as a brand, beyond the contents of their big “Beijing” mugs that have pictures of the Great Wall of China on them. It’s common to see customers buying piles of Starbucks tat at the Beijing branches – keyrings seem particularly popular – and knockoff versions abound. Many shops in the capital stock cheap mugs bearing blurry versions of the iconic green logo.</p><p>“It’s considered a luxury product,” says Fangting Sun, a team leader at Euromonitor International who analyses the Chinese coffee chain industry. “The younger generations here love to follow the trends in the luxury industry. Starbucks got popular [early after its 1999 launch in China], then with rising disposable incomes a habit was cultivated.”</p><p>Starbucks’ social media-led marketing has been central to this habit-building. Beyond the endless Starbucks selfies being shared on WeChat, China’s enormously popular messaging app, the company recently launched a gifting service on the app that allows users to pay for a drink for a friend, who can redeem it in store.</p><p>Starbucks also now accepts payment for normal transactions through WeChat and has launched quirky functions such as one that suggests a style of drink to buy, sent along with a song, when a user tells Starbucks what mood they are in via an app. The latter is a measure that could turn off many cynical consumers in the West, but has only bolstered Starbucks’ brand power in China.</p><h3>Premium and desirable</h3><p>“The concept of marketing is newer here,” says Lamb. “There’s no actual direct translation to Chinese from English of the word ‘marketing’. Things such as the WeChat mood function would come across as gimmicky in the West but here, as a tailored, personalised thing, it was really effective. The Chinese weren’t sceptical about it.”</p><p>Similarly, in the West Starbucks, for all its success, is often seen as the ultimate symbol of capitalism – the company’s name almost a buzzword for soulless corporate America. In China this kind of backlash just hasn’t happened.</p><p>Here, although a rise in the number of boutique coffee shops suggests there is also an increasing taste for less mainstream palates, the middle classes overwhelmingly seem to regard capitalism as something positive and aspirational.</p><p>It comes as little surprise then that Starbucks is set to hit overdrive on its premium branding efforts by launching a series of ‘roasteries’. These are higher-end branches designed to be trendy meeting places, a bit more swish than its standard coffee shops.</p><p>Wong has described the forthcoming Shanghai branch, which promises an “immersive, all-sensory experience” as a “second Disneyland in Shanghai. It’s going to attract not only people in Shanghai, but also a lot of tourists in China.”</p><p>This all makes sense to Chen, as does Starbucks’ general plan to double up the number of outlets in China within five years. Although Wong has mentioned tier-one and two cities as Starbucks’ likely main targets, the potential beyond the biggest urban hubs is enormous.</p><h3>Craving cool stuff</h3><p>“China’s coffee house market is far from saturated,” says Chen. In a report on the industry released last December, her firm Mintel found that 35% of coffee consumers in tier two and three cities in China were heavy users of coffee houses, compared to 53% for tier one cities such as Beijing and Shanghai.</p><p>“This gap shows great room for expansion in the use of coffee houses in lower tier cities,” says Chen. “In fact, consumers from lower-tier cities crave trendy coffee house brands. They’ve been informed of new cool stuff happening in the bigger cities and are eager to experience it for themselves. In August 2016, when Starbucks opened its first store in Deyang, a tier-three city, consumers lined up from 6am.”</p><p>Starbucks’ China expansion, and that of the coffee house market it leads, is looking less like a bet and more like a chocolate chip cookie slam dunk.  </p>
