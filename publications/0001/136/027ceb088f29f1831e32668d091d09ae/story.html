  </td><td valign="top">  <p class="dropcap">Singapore ushered in the year of the Rooster with a big bang. It aired Kung Fu Fighter, Hidden Sugar, a 90-second video on the evils of sugar in New Year goodies. Just two days after it was posted on the gov.sg’s Facebook page it had garnered one million views and over 17,000 shares.</p><p>The festive season of Chinese New Year is known for heavy consumption of sweets such as pineapple tarts and bakwa (salty-sweet dried meat). This educational campaign is part of the Singapore government’s war on diabetes, which affects 440,000 Singaporeans.</p><p>In the US, kale and avocado on toast have become iconic foods for a growing population committed to healthy eating. Clean eating, Paleo, low sugar, low carb, vegan and gluten free are just a few of the buzzwords among the Western health community. While these words may not roll easily off their tongues, more Asians are also making healthier food choices.</p><p> </p><h3><b>Growing awareness</b></h3><p>Healthy eating in Asia is no longer a niche market limited to high-earning, gym-going urban professionals in Hong Kong and Singapore. “It started with this group, but it is now expanding and growing,” says Clara Ming Pi FCSI. The rise in diabetes and obesity is a real concern now in Asia. This was the focus of Pi’s plenary presentation at last year’s joint conference in Kuala Lumpur for the Malaysian Dietetics’ Association (MDA) and American Overseas Dietetic Association (AODA). She believes more countries will benefit from educational campaigns like the initiative from the Singapore government, positively affecting the health of people as well as the planet.</p><p>Restaurants and food manufacturers in Asia have started focusing on creating healthier food options. In 2013, Euromonitor Research observed how Asia leads as the fastest-growing market for health and wellness packaged goods and beverages, namely in China, Indonesia, Vietnam, Thailand, and India. Nielsen’s 2014 global report on snacking attributes the growing worldwide demand for healthy food partly to factors like rising affluence in developing countries. The 2015 Euromarket International cites China and India among the fastest growing market for biscuits and snack bars, including breakfast muesli and granola bars.</p><p>In China, organic food is gaining interest among the rising middle class, without interventions from the government. More Chinese families are seeing the benefit of investing a portion of their increasing incomes on better food choices rather than luxury goods.</p><p> </p><h3><b>Changing traditions</b></h3><p>Mintel observed a 17% increase in food and drink launches with functional claims in Southeast Asia between 2011 and 2014, indicating importance of health and wellness in making food choices. Seeing the growth potential in high nutrition in Asia, trend forecaster Stefan Hajkowicz is pushing New Zealand to increase exports to the region. In China where many are wary of tainted food products, New Zealand already has a great reputation for dairy products. It won’t be a stretch expanding to other healthy food products.</p><p>In Singapore, McDonald’s launched a vegetarian burger made of green peas, carrots, green beans, red peppers and potatoes last August, making it a permanent item on their menu. One QSR concept quickly growing in the region is Salad Stop! It began in Singapore in 2009 as a revolutionary movement towards health and wellbeing. Today, it prides itself on being the first and largest healthy food chain in Asia operating in Singapore, Manila, Jakarta and Tokyo. Catering to the local palate, the salads are inspired by flavours such as Oh Crab Lah! – a nod to Singapore’s chili crab – and Jai Ho! – with free-range tandoori chicken and Indian spices. With a freshness commitment of 72 hours from earth to bowl, ingredients are sourced from local partners.</p><p>“Whether people are going vegan for animal welfare, health or environmental reasons there’s no doubt there’s a surge in vegan foods popping up in restaurants all over Asia,” says Jason Barker, vice president of PETA Asia. “Our recently released list of the top 10 vegan-friendly cities in Asia proves there is a huge demand for plant-based foods across the continent and businesses are catching on. From vegan isaw (chicken intestines) at Greenery Kitchen in Manila to all-vegan bakeries such as Veganerie in Bangkok and Vegan Heaven in Taipei, businesses are finding new, cruelty-free, healthy ways to re-create traditional favourites without using meat or dairy products.” Barker reports large crowds at all-vegan festivals in Hong Kong, Taipei, Bali, Bangkok, Ho Chi Minh City, Singapore, Tokyo, and the Philippines. There’s even an all-vegan supermarket in Taiwan, as well as a meat-free supermarket in Hong Kong.</p><p> </p><h3><b>Local options</b></h3><p>Although Asians are gradually becoming more mindful of cruelty to animals, Barker believes many shift to a plant-based diet for health reasons. “Plant foods contain no cholesterol, whereas meat, eggs and dairy products contain large amounts of cholesterol and saturated fat,” he explains. “Approximately 90% of Asians are lactose-intolerant, meaning that their bodies cannot break down the sugar in milk, which can result in symptoms such as acne, cramps, bloating and diarrhoea.”</p><p>There are many ways for manufacturers and restaurants to cater to Asia’s growing health food market. Pi sees an opportunity in producing and delivering healthy food to schools, office buildings and facilities. In Hong Kong, this has already taken off. The healthy food delivery scene is a growing business with at least 15 companies creating and delivering customised meal plans for professionals.</p><p>As more Asians embrace a healthier diet, they need not consume imported kale from the US or quinoa from South America. Pi emphasises the importance of using local healthy ingredients, “It’s not only cheaper and fresher, but reduces the carbon footprint of food.”  </p>
