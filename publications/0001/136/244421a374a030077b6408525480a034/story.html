<td valign="top">  <p class="dropcap">Exuding an infectious joie de vivre, Vehbi Varlik describes some of his interests. “I participate in a variety of activities – as much as my time allows. Swimming is a pleasure for me. I ski during the winter, I go to football matches frequently and I get a massage whenever I have the opportunity.”</p><p>Varlik’s greatest passion by far, however, is his work. “I love working. I am happy spending time and energy at work.” Being born in Kosovo (then part of Yugoslavia), followed by a move to Bursa, Turkey, at the age of six presented its fair share of adversity, but also, as Varlik explains, cultivated a belief in the value of perseverance. “I have worked night and day in order to realise my dreams. I had no other chance of success as my childhood was difficult. My then partner and I gained our reputation in Bursa and neighbouring cities with our work and faith and, gradually, expanded over to Anatolia”.</p><p>Born in 1951, Varlik began his foodservice career in 1971, balancing his mechanical engineering studies with a job in kitchen provision. Varlik’s career trajectory reflects his high-level aspirations. He started as a draughtsman before founding his first business in 1977 and setting up Inoksan three years later. He has been there ever since, serving variously as advisory board member, president and chairman.</p><p>The list of people Varlik admires reinforces the centrality of aspiration to his work ethic. In addition to Turkish businessmen such as Ishak Alaton, Üzeyir Garih and Sarik Tara, his heroes include friend and Ali Group chairman Luciano Berti, Goldman Sachs CEO and chairman Lloyd Blankfein and US business magnate Bill Gates. Success, Varlik explains, is the uniting theme. “I have always read books and biographies of successful business people. I still continue to watch people around me and above me,” he says.</p><h3><b>Hunger for success</b></h3><p>When Varlik founded Inoksan in 1980 with his business partner, Coskun Irfan, the pair placed this hunger for success at the heart of their new company by prioritising innovation from the outset. “We kept on working, always aiming for the best and never giving up. The right strategy, innovative R&amp;D, proper marketing and investment in technology are the most essential elements of our success story. Since the very first day we have placed great emphasis on innovation and technology when manufacturing kitchen equipment. We continue growing, striving to be the best in all we do, without compromising that entrepreneurial spirit.”</p><p>It’s a philosophy that has yielded impressive results. Varlik’s claim of having “marked down some considerable successes in our industry” is a modest take on a stunning entrepreneurial journey. Inoksan is now a truly global company, exporting 35% of its products to 80 countries across five continents. All of this is done from the firm’s vast 20,000 sq m (24,000 sq yd) industrial home in Bursa. In addition to “countless projects” in its Turkish base, Inoksan boasts an impressive list of international clients, including Google’s Brazil HQ, Hilton Baku, Abu Dhabi National Oil Company HQ, Sheraton Jumeirah Beach Hotel in Dubai, the Baku Olympic Stadium, InterContinental Dubai Marina, Radisson Tbilisi and Taj Hotel Yeshwantpur, India.</p><p>“We started with our dream,” says Varlik, “and today we’re one of the leading industry names specialising in commercial kitchens in our country. We have succeeded in making a name for ourselves in the global market as well and it makes us proud.”</p><p>Inoksan’s growth as a company echoes Varlik’s own life story: an ascent to success from humble beginnings, guided by a belief in perseverance as the key to success.</p><p>No stranger to hardship after a tough upbringing, Varlik recalls that the challenges of his youth were mirrored in the prejudice Inoksan faced during its early forays into the corporate world. “The fact we were offering ‘Turkish products’ meant we were not welcomed easily. Turkey’s image was undermined by exports from some of its more unprofessional companies. Foreigners tended to perceive Turkish products as low quality. They expected us to offer special prices before considering us.”</p><p>Over time this prejudice abated, thanks to a combination of Turkey’s strengthened global standing and the perseverance of Varlik and his colleagues. “We attended many exhibitions and travelled the globe. Turgut Ozal, prime minister of Turkey from 1983, started the movement to open Turkey up to the world and our country’s image gradually improved. Political support means Turkey is now much better known globally, especially in the manufacturing industry. Confidence in Turkish companies and our products has increased considerably – Turkey is a respectable country in the world of business.”</p><p>The auspicious business climate provided just the right conditions for Inoksan’s tremendous growth. It is now a seven-company-strong group, with regional offices in six major cities and almost 40 authorised dealers across Turkey – not to mention 80 sales points abroad. Varlik explains the firm’s overarching strategy has been crucial in facilitating this rapid expansion. “Inoksan’s marketing function has provided stability over the years, helped by specialist management staff and employee teams. We aim to be in constant interaction with our target consumer group on an online and offline basis through advertising, participation in events and exhibitions, sponsorships and other campaigns.”</p><h3><b>Ambitious company growth</b></h3><p>Following Coskun Irfan’s departure from the company in 2013, Varlik’s role in establishing this strategy was enhanced as he took on his former partner’s 40% stake in the business. “We were in partnership for 33 years,” Varlik says. “But Mr Coskun also had other companies he established years ago and he wanted to manage those companies – that’s why we took the decision in parallel.”</p><p>Such a change in the company’s structure marked a significant shift for Inoksan after three decades of joint ownership, but Varlik has big plans. The 35% export figure is just the beginning: “it is our goal to raise that to 50% by 2023. We want to focus on the global arena and enhance our worldwide recognition.”</p><p>As Varlik explains, this means focusing on the best opportunities for growth. “We want to make an impact in Azerbaijan just like we made here in Turkey. We’re also targeting the Middle East, and plan to have a more efficient role in the US, where we have had activities for a while.”</p><p>These are bold ambitions for an already well-established company. Does Inoksan have the tools for success? Varlik answers with a firm ‘yes’. “One thing should be clearly stated here, Inoksan will become a global trademark by growing stronger – undertaking unique projects in addition to innovative products being created by Turkish engineers, pushing up standards worldwide. Each product coming out of Turkey under the Inoksan brand is very assertive in competition.”</p><p>It’s not hard to see Varlik’s underlying philosophy at play as he describes his plans for the future. “What most successful people have in common is hard work. This is a never-ending process, from which you always learn,” he says.</p><p>Inoksan is perhaps best known for its prolific inventiveness. The figures speak for themselves; the company has six patents, patents utility models and 22 design registrations – its product range is a list of innovations that have marked upheavals in foodservice efficiency.</p><p>“Innovative and unique products of our trademark include combi steamers manufactured to meet international standards and promote good health. They offer cost advantages thanks to savings from energy consumption,” says Varlik. “Standardisation of hygiene and safety systems helps our cooking equipment stand out. Our doner kebab machines are ergonomically designed, meeting hygiene conditions and offering increased functions for quality cooking. We have also made considerable technological progress in our warewashers in recent years.”</p><p>And there’s more to come. “I believe our new generation of combi steamers, which we plan to launch this year, will make an impact on the global arena,” he says.</p><p>Innovative manufacturing is combined with Inoksan’s company ethic, balancing original products with a strong emphasis on customer service. “I can say without doubt that we offer unconditional and full support during post-sales and post-project stages. All this makes us proud to describe ourselves as a leading company in the industry.”</p><h3><b>Customer service</b></h3><p>After-sales service, practically a business all of its own at Inoksan, is a particularly gratifying aspect of the company’s operations for Varlik. In addition to the firm’s 400 service staff, introducing “the first professional call centre in the industry” in 2015 was a landmark moment. “The distance between us and our customers is just 12 seconds,” he says.</p><p>The changes Varlik has overseen, and his ambitions for the future, show this is a company continuing to grow. But with this growth comes new challenges. It’s hard to see how Inoksan can maintain the dynamism underpinning its past successes while juggling the growing bureaucratic demands associated with being an established company. Is the prospect of losing this dynamism a worry?</p><p>Not for Varlik. A company structure based on delegation and trust is designed to insulate Inoksan from the threat of new challenges, with the board of directors nurturing the “free discretion” of their juniors to ensure macro-strategies are implemented effectively. “When you assign such responsibility and freedom to your operational units you don’t lose flexibility and pace no matter how much you grow,” he says.</p><p>This flexibility is indispensable in the broader context of the foodservice industry, which has changed so much since Inoksan’s founding in 1980. Varlik puts technological development at the heart of this change, precipitating new product profiles, altering the technology base of manufacturing and revolutionising the concept of the foodservice industry itself.</p><p>Nevertheless, the firm’s philosophy has remained the same: prioritising innovation to reach new heights. Inoksan continues to devote 2% of yearly turnover to R&amp;D, a policy that has allowed it to remain ahead of the curve in an industry characterised by rapid evolution. “Concepts of innovation, R&amp;D and technology are the keys to our long-term success,” says Varlik. This has meant heavy investment in keeping production and management staff up to speed as well as a keen eye on the latest technological developments.</p><p>Changes in the company, industry evolution and ambitious plans for growth mean Varlik is busier than ever before. “I was the operational leader for many years,” he explains. “Now, I have adapted and am getting used to strategic leading.” Straddling operations and strategy in Inoksan’s vast empire means each day is packed with a range of tasks; reports to read, meetings with general managers and attending wider industry events are just some of Varlik’s daily chores.</p><p>However, a burgeoning foodservice industry means Varlik’s all-seeing role is increasingly vital. When Inoksan first started, the company’s global prestige was damaged by Turkey’s weak reputation for foodservice. Now it is a foodservice hub, becoming more vibrant all the time. This creates new opportunities, but also unprecedented challenges as local competitors gain ground on their established forebears. “I think our industry has matured to a certain extent,” reflects Varlik. “Turkey has gained superiority in the commercial kitchen market compared to other countries in the region. Now we are chasing Spain and have even reached a level where we can compete with them.”</p><h3><b>Increased competition</b></h3><p>The political and economical climate presents challenges of a different kind to firms pursuing growth. This climate is particularly volatile in the Middle East; Varlik still sees the region as ripe for “considerable business” but concedes that stagnant oil prices could create “serious economic problems in the next two to three years”.</p><p>As ever, Varlik’s plan is to persevere. The Middle East may be his home region, but he is upbeat about opportunities further afield, which he predicts will become more significant than ever, both for Inoksan and the whole industry. “US and Asian markets will be important for us over the next five years, and we have serious activities in Africa that I believe will yield outcomes for us and our industry. Also, despite the economic crisis, our sales in Europe have continued to rise.”</p><p>Varlik is optimistic that, given the wealth of options, Inoksan can localise in critical markets to attain a position like the one it has established in Turkey. He points out that foodservice consultants have a vital role to play in this, particularly for innovative companies such as Inoksan. “Consultants have become the driving force for the development of our industry. Their expectations and guidance in the design of our kitchens, the quality of the devices used and technical specifications encourage the whole industry to do better.”</p><p>In everything – the hard work he has already put in, enthusiasm about his industry and his positivity about the future – Varlik’s passion shines through. The end result is a serious player in global foodservice who captures his overarching outlook on life through the medium of his favourite pastime of all: tennis. “It’s a sport I can’t give up,” says Varlik. “The net across the court shows everyone their boundaries. You never know where the ball will go, so always have to be ready with a forehand and backhand. Service, on the other hand, represents ‘all in good time’ to me – everything is effective when used at the right time and in the right order. Then you have volleys and slices – moves representing the importance of specific skills.”</p><p>One thing is for sure: as far as innovative and ambitious foodservice goes, it’s game, set and match to Inoksan and Vehbi Varlik.</p>
