  </td><td valign="top">  <h3><b>What is good food?</b></h3><p>There is no good food, only a good diet. I believe that almost every food can be part of a healthy balanced diet. Often society wants to label things as good or bad, clean or unclean, healthy or unhealthy. The truth is we can consume most foods in a healthy way if we get them in the right balance and proportions. So I want to push the fact that there are good diets rather than good food.</p><p> </p><h3>You must have seen a huge change in people’s attitude to healthy food?</h3><p>If I think back to 10 years ago I’d go to events where a company such as Alpro would be promoting plant-based eating, but I’d be thinking, “this is not going to take off”. A decade later we have come so far. I think the adoption of healthy habits by celebrities and the people the younger generation follow, combined with social media, has been a massive factor.</p><p> </p><h3>What are the drivers behind this change?</h3><p>The amount of media attention that nutrition gets is interesting. We are so interested in food and we all have to eat. You can choose whether to go out, smoke or drink, but you can’t choose whether to eat. So people have a vested interest in food and nutrition and that drives the media interest in any new research and reports that come out. People have more interest but they are also confused because they hear conflicting reports all the time.</p><p> </p><h3>What role do operators have in helping people make the right choices?</h3><p>So much of people’s diet is consumed in the fast casual sector when they are out and about. It has an influence on the nutrition you get; how much fat you have eaten, how much fiber you get. Chefs and the menu designers have a huge influence on what people eat and I think it is important they make sure they support our health.</p><p> </p><h3>Does the industry have a responsibility to give people these healthy offerings?</h3><p>Responsibility is one of those questions in the media: should it be a regulatory issue, is the health of the nation the industry’s responsibility because they are serving the food or is it our personal responsibility? The reality is our collective national health is the responsibility of all of us. It is up to the individual to make sure they are educated and they are choosing healthy options, but they can’t make those choices unless healthy options are on offer.</p><p> </p><h3>What makes an ideal menu?</h3><p>It’s not too long, it has enough variety to suit all parties, it has choices so people can either have more indulgent options or they can take a more healthy, balanced option. Finally it needs to be at the right price. </p>
