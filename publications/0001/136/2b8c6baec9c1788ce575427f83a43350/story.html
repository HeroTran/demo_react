<td valign="top">  <p class="dropcap">I didn’t have any goals when I was young; no princess goals or anything. I didn’t know what I wanted to be when I grew up. I still don’t know what I want to be when I grow up,” laughs Christine Guyott.</p><p>We meet in Orlando, Florida, during the NAFEM 2017 Show on the day she is due to be honoured with FER magazine’s prestigious Industry Service Award. Princess goals notwithstanding, Guyott, a hugely respected consultant in the healthcare sector in particular and a principal of Rippe Associates, has certainly made a lasting impression on the industry.</p><p>Guyott grew up in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Her first hospitality experience was when her parents owned a bar in the north of the state. “They didn’t have a lot of foodservice, but it was a fun place to grow up,” she says.</p><p>Having attended school in Minneapolis, the expectation for Guyott and her peers was “to move away and go to a good college.” She ended up in Pepperdine University in California. “In high school I took Spanish for five years, adding Japanese for the last two years. I really liked languages and I wanted to travel. I thought I was going to be an international business person,” she smiles.</p><h3>The easy science</h3><p>As a freshman, in order to receive grant money Guyott worked on campus in the housing department. “I had to register before everyone else in school, and somebody said: “Take Nutrition – it’s the easy science.” So I did and I fell in love with it. My professors were fabulous. It was a small programme; our classes were four or five people. It was a great learning experience,” she says.</p><p>One of the reasons Guyott believes she broke into consulting at the age of 27 was due to one of her college professors having a relationship with Clevenger Nutritional Services, the management advisory service (MAS) arm of Clevenger Associates in California. In her senior year at college Guyott went to work at Clevenger in their office on Ocean Avenue in Santa Monica. It was a formative experience Guyott describes as “the coolest thing.”</p><p>At the end of her studies the next step for Guyott was to become a registered dietician, which required an internship. “I applied to all the California internships, which were the hardest to get into. In my first year I didn’t get a match, so Clevenger had me stay on there for a year. So I worked with them pulling cut sheets, selecting equipment and writing specs. We had some fabulous projects. One of them was a design project for the University of California, designing nutritional lab kitchens. I was able to help pick out materials. It was a lot of fun.”</p><p>A year later Guyott was matched into the Mayo Clinic internship programme at St Mary’s campus in Rochester, Minnesota. “It was probably one of the best internships on offer. I even got a stipend, which is unheard of. I lived in the hospital for a year. It was amazing,” she says.</p><p>Call it fate, or pure luck, but Guyott had inadvertently stumbled across a foodservice sector that would ultimately prove to shape and inspire her more than any other. “My big passion is healthcare,” she says. “Mayo was a huge influence. You see all these incredible healing experiences and world-renowned doctors. It’s overwhelming and it just takes you in.”</p><p>Guyott soon found the healthcare sector appealed to her methodical way of working, but ultimately she found the day-to-day role of nutritional support dietician “too repetitive” to consider it as a career. “I got very frustrated. Every day was exactly the same. It wasn’t something I could have done long term,” she says.</p><h3>Customer focus</h3><p>Guyott sat her dietician’s registration exam, moving back to Minneapolis-St Paul and working for nine months at Women Infants and Children’s (WIC) Program, a community initiative distributing vouchers for underprivileged mothers. By now though, she was looking for a career position. She started working for the foodservice distributor Sysco Minnesota in a healthcare sales specialist job.</p><p>“The role just looked right up my alley,” she says. “We weren’t directly responsible for sales, but we got to help the sales people. A lot of them came from the restaurant industry, so they didn’t know how to speak the healthcare language. So we helped them.”</p><p>While Guyott had felt frustrated working on the clinical side of healthcare, on the commercial side she felt very much appreciated. “We would come up with menus, teach classes, do ‘in-services’ for their staff and teach them about food safety or portioning. Every day was different. It was challenging and interesting.”</p><p>Guyott admits she has been an introvert from a young age. “I was so shy when I was growing up that I couldn’t answer the phone. I couldn’t speak to people. This has improved, but even at the FCSI Symposium this week I wanted to ask a question, so I raised my hand and my heart just went crazy,” she laughs.</p><p>The Sysco role, however, proved to be pivotal in sparking an interest in how to communicate effectively with customers. “At Sysco it was about just talking to people. I wasn’t trying to sell them anything – I was just helping them. A lot of the time customers were in small nursing homes in the middle of North Dakota. They loved visitors and appreciated the help, so I think it’s what fostered my interest in wanting to work with customers. That’s the part of my job that I love today.”</p><p>In 1991 one of Guyott’s clients at Sysco told her the Minnesota-based consultancy Rippe Associates were hiring. “She said there was a lot of travel but that I might be interested in it. And so here I was, with Bob [Rippe, the firm’s founder] and Terry [Pellegrino FCSI, principal] in an interview and I’m back into a consulting firm. There was only one in my tri-state area. I just think it was what I was supposed to be. How odd that you have consulting experience at college, which is a one in a million shot, right? And then you end up working for 20-odd years for a consulting firm,” she says.</p><p>Guyott began working with Pellegrino on K-12, schools, university and corrections projects as an operations consultant. This role was a combination of design and MAS, she suggests. “We went to the meetings with the principal and would be the communication person with the foodservice directors. We’d be the prime communicator on meeting records and would write specifications and meet with all the manufacturers to hear about their equipment. I enjoyed it straightaway,” she says.</p><p>“I can’t remember the first two years, it was just overwhelming,” she says. “I was on a couple of projects with Bob from a healthcare standpoint and after several years he would introduce me as the COO of the healthcare team. So I began working with Bob and then pretty much solely on healthcare after that, which felt comfortable to me.”</p><h3>The best of health</h3><p>Rippe instilled confidence in Guyott, which she thrived on. “He did nothing but support me and tell people how useful I was. I think it helped a lot when it came to the transition of his retirement. People were already thinking of me as Bob’s right hand person,” she says.</p><p>Pellegrino, meanwhile proved to be a mentor in another significant way, taking the time to teach Guyott how to draw project designs. “It was on Terry’s team that I would draw schools. Because schools are straightforward, laying those out was a good starting point. She was just really gracious. She didn’t tell you it sucked,” she laughs.</p><p>Allying the methodical, problem-solving element of project management work, which Guyott feels “fits that side of my dietician brain” with the creative aspect of design provides “a perfect blend” in her career, she says: “It takes a long time to learn how to be a consultant. And it’s hard to be the expert in the room until you have the experience behind you. I started when I was 28, I just listened and tried to observe as much as I could. I was scared to death because there was no formal training, so I worked and worked.”</p><p>Approximately 80% of Guyott’s work is now healthcare oriented, from a long-standing project with Stanford Hospitals and Clinics to smaller North Pine critical access hospital in Minnesota. The rest of her work is mainly K-12 projects. Under Guyott’s management, Rippe Associates are working on 30 or so projects at any one time. “All different levels – some are design, some are feasibility studies. Some are in construction administration, which doesn’t take as much of my time,” she says.</p><h3>Talent and passion</h3><p>Guyott believes one of the biggest challenges the industry faces is developing its talent pools, both on the operator and the design side. As someone who helped reinvigorate FCSI’s Council for Emerging Consultants (formerly ICON) Committee, which attracts and mentors younger consultants, she believes passionately that FCSI has an important role to play in this regard for the future of the profession.“I think it elevates us as professionals. When you have a professional organisation that holds its members to standards, it makes everybody else rise up,” she says.</p><p>“Our biggest competitors are dealers, and what do we have to offer that a dealer doesn’t? We are fee based and we aren’t selling equipment, so it can be a tough sell,” she continues. “When somebody can get design drawings for free versus paying, you have to educate. I often find myself saying to architects: ‘Would you want your client to hire the furniture salesperson to lay out your building? No. Do you want the equipment sales guy to lay out the kitchen? No’.”</p><p>Guyott’s passion for seeking constant improvement in the industry she loves remains undimmed – a princess goal if ever there was one. “My dad always says, ‘people don’t care about how much you know unless they know how much you care’,” she smiles.</p>
