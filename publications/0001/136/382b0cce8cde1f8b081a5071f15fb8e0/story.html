<td valign="top">  <p class="dropcap">Watching Chan Hon Meng clean a nearby table, I can’t help but wonder how many Michelin-starred chefs bus tables in their restaurants. But despite having achieved a distinction coveted by chefs worldwide, this diminutive man, fondly known as Hawker Chan, is clearing up. His was one of the first two Michelin stars ever awarded to hawkers, Singapore’s name for food stalls. The tables are in his newly opened second location, but it hasn’t eased the legendary line-ups for his Liao Fan Hong Kong Soya Sauce Chicken Rice and Noodle – his version of Hainanese barbecued chicken served on rice or noodles. </p><p>In more than 40 years of food writing, rarely have meals in Michelin Guide restaurants come my way. But here in Singapore, I had four opportunities over the course of just one week. And Hawker Chan’s cost less than US$3.</p><p>This tiny city-state has always been all about food. While Singaporeans will happily shell out $75 for a meal in one of the city’s star-studded restaurants, they also regularly patronise the more than 6,000 hawkers found all over the city, many gathered in one of the many “hawker centres” such as Lau Pa Sat (see main picture), which includes an outdoor night market with flaming barbecue stations. Here, for just a few dollars, one can feast handsomely from a host of different, mainly Asian cuisines.</p><h3>Peranakan influence</h3><p>Malay and Chinese have been the strongest influences on both customs and food. Indeed, a historic blend of these has created a unique Singapore culture, Peranakan, which is enjoying a new zenith these days. The decor of the new Indigo Hotel (IHG Hotels), located in the Peranakan neighbourhood of Joo Chiat, features this culture’s distinctive pastel colours and vibrant tiles throughout. Housed within the former Joo Chiat police station at the front of the hotel, Indigo’s restaurant, Baba Chews, also serves traditional Peranakan dishes.</p><p>Indeed, restaurants are springing up all over Singapore, serving Peranakan delicacies such as rendang (a slow-simmered spicy beef or chicken dish), kueh (small cakes and sweets often made with coconut and palm sugar), and laksa (a spicy coconut soup with noodles, fish and meat which reputedly takes many hours to prepare, and for which the recipes are generally closely guarded family secrets).</p><p>“I grew up eating rice, curries and sambals (chili sauces). But as a chef, I started cooking French cuisine,” says chef Malcolm Lee of Candlenut, the first Michelin starred Peranakan restaurant. “It didn’t feel right, here in my heart. I don’t feel any connection to coq au vin. I felt something was out of balance.”</p><p>Over the past seven years Candlenut (named for a local nut used in Peranakan cuisine) has evolved from elegant, plated dishes to what Lee calls the “essence of Peranakan food”.</p><p>“I returned to the rustic recipes of my grandmother, he explains. “Traditionally, we fry spices with lots of oil. Candlenut’s versions are refined to give you the mouth feel, but not so much fat.” His rendang is made with lean Wagyu beef flavoured with serundeng (spicy, fried, grated coconut) and turmeric leaf.</p><h3>Passion for food</h3><p>It’s probably not surprising that restaurants such as Baba Chews and Candlenut are thriving. When it comes to dining two distinct threads define the restaurant scene in this tiny country. The first is the Singaporean love of their historical roots and pride in the food that has evolved from these. So Peranakan cuisine, using authentic, local ingredients, is on the up. In fact, 328 Katong Laksa, a corner eatery that specialises in its eponymous soup, was awarded a Bib Gourmand by Michelin. But this is balanced against a second thread. Singaporeans are adventurous diners, interested in other cuisines and in experimenting with new foods. This has seen the opening of restaurants serving what has been dubbed Mod Sin (modern Singaporean) by its creator, Willin Low.</p><p>Lawyer turned chef, Low is the brains behind the definitive Mod Sin restaurant, Wild Rocket, and several sister eateries – Relish, Wild Oats and most recently, Po. He explains that his food grew out of his homesickness while studying law in England. He would cook the foods of home, using ingredients he could find and improvising when necessary. The result was a hit with friends who urged him to don a chef’s hat. After seven years practicing law, he did.</p><p>“Singaporeans are so passionate about food. At first we were terrified people would say: ‘What have you done with Singapore food?’” laughs Low. His creations are undoubtedly unique. For example, one of his early dishes still on the menu is pasta tossed with a pesto made from candlenuts and laksa leaf. (This local herb, which is often called Vietnamese mint in Europe, is usually used only in laksa here.) Instead of cheese, he tops the dish with dried shrimp, another traditional ingredient. On his newest menu, laksa leaf provides the flavour for a salad served with savoury ice cream dressing (pictured below right).</p><p>But don’t call Mod Sin a fusion cuisine. “Fusion is confusion,” Low says, emphasising the first syllable. “You just have to remember that food is not limited by geography today. I like to borrow ingredients from everywhere.”</p><p>Nonetheless, he insists, his food is true to its roots, “In this age of globalisation, I think it’s important to celebrate why your country is unique. If everyone wants to make cupcakes, then no one will remember how to make the kueh that my grandmother used to make.” On the menu at Wild Rocket you’ll find banana kueh in a typically Willin Low pairing with pineapple sorbet and salted caramel.</p><p>This chef might have found a perfect formula for piquing the interest of a place that the Michelin Guide has dubbed “the dining capital of Asia”. After all, chefs from around the world have come to Singapore to flex their culinary biceps including superstars like Daniel Boulud, Gordon Ramsay, Wolfgang Puck, Mario Batali, Jamie Oliver, Luke Mangan and more.</p><p>Beyond Asian, stellar chefs are serving European cuisines in Singapore’s finest hotels. UK chef Kirk Westaway serves fine French cuisine at Jaan at The Stamford (Swissôtel). At Brasserie Les Saveurs, the signature restaurant of The St. Regis Singapore, Canadian chef Thomas Cruise creates contemporary European fare. The Fullerton’s Lighthouse restaurant, overlooking the marina, specialises in dishes from Campania, Sardinia and Sicily prepared by chef Carlo Marengoni. And superstar chef, Joël Robuchon just added five more stars to his collection for his two restaurants at Resorts World Sentosa.</p><h3>Time for tea</h3><p>At Raffles Grill (pictured above), the oldest Western restaurant in Singapore, located in its oldest hotel, chef Pierre Burgade offers diners French cuisine with a modern twist. His special degustation menu is a masterpiece of small plates, each perfectly crafted in a marriage of colour and flavour. Burgade has to please discriminating palates. For more than 100 years, Raffles Hotel has played host to the world’s glitterati and most of its royalty. During British colonial times, this was the place to go for a Singapore Sling at the Long Bar, for an elegant dinner or for afternoon tea.</p><p>Faithful to British tradition, you’ll still find a complete afternoon tea served in the Tiffin Room at Raffles. Indeed, this decadent indulgence is served all over Singapore. You’ll even find a charming afternoon tea at Marks &amp; Spencer’s café on Orchard Street in the heart of the chic shopping district.</p><p>Whether one chooses fine restaurants or hawkers, the government’s food inspection programme ensures that the food meets high standards. Everyone serving food displays an inspection card with their rating from A to D. Both A and B are acceptable. In fact, we enjoyed an outstanding plate of Hong Kong Noodles (called Singapore Noodles everywhere else in the world) at a B-graded no-name hawker for $3. Could Singapore break even more new ground with Michelin? Could a no-name eatery earn Michelin honours? </p>
