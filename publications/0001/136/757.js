Starbucks, notably, has huge expansion plans, reports Jamie Fullerton","body":"<table class=\"default\" cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\">\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">  <p class=\"dropcap\">This is a place for taking photos and showing off,” says Xiao Xue, 30, sipping a Starbucks coffee in a branch of the US mega-chain in central Beijing.</p><p> “I think that when Starbucks first entered China they meant to mould the brand into one for proper office workers,” she continues, as a group of young girls sitting around a nearby table giggle and fiddle with their smartphones. “But somehow it’s become a place for young people taking selfies.”</p><p>Starbucks currently has around 2,500 outlets in China – that’s a lot of selfies with mugs of Americano being taken each day. The flood is set to intensify, with the firm announcing last November that it will double the number of venues it has in the country within the next five years, as part of its global plan to open 12,000 further stores in total. The company is expecting a 10% hike in global profit as a result of all the new openings.</p><p>“This is the early chapter of our China growth right now,” Belinda Wong, chief executive of Starbucks’ operations in China, told the South China Morning Post. “We have barely even scratched the surface. There is plenty of space to fill in first and second-tier cities where we have already opened – Beijing, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Shanghai.”</p><p>The Hong Kong-based newspaper called the aggressive expansion plan a “big bet” in China, which is traditionally the land of tea rather than hazelnut lattes. But the steady rise of Starbucks’ popularity in the country since launching there in 1999 suggests that the move is hardly a gamble.</p><p>“In China everything moves fast – it’s difficult for some western companies to understand how quickly and decisively things happen,” says Benji Lamb of the Shanghai-based Gentlemen Marketing Agency. “The scale of investment might seem crazy, but it’s common practice here.”</p><h3>Branding and promotion</h3><p>Indeed, Starbucks’ recent Chinese expansion – it opened 500 new stores in the country in 2015 – has already made China the firm’s top market outside the US. Rivals such as British chain Costa Coffee have followed suit – Costa plans to open 900 more stores in China, bringing its total to around 1,400 by 2020.</p><p>The rise in demand can partly be explained by the rapid modernisation of business culture in China’s largest cities over the past decade. “With urbanisation, the faster pace of life has made coffee more important in consumers’ lives,” says Summer Chen, an analyst at Mintel who wrote the market research company’s recent China coffee industry report. “Tea, on the other hand, is mostly consumed for nourishing, relaxation, or thirst-quenching. We found that the top reason for Chinese consumers to drink coffee was to boost energy.”</p><p>The dominating factor that has made Starbucks such a strong market leader in the coffee shop sector (in 2013, even before its expansion got hyper-aggressive, Euromonitor International said it had a 31.5% share), though, is its marketing strategy, including its branding of the coffee itself and its promotion on social media.</p><p>In the US Starbucks is presented as solid, fun, one-on-every-corner, drink-one-a-day coffee for people within a relatively wide income range. In China it is marketed as a premium product, retailing at prices around 20% higher than those in the US.</p><h3>Place to show off</h3><p>A three-storey Starbucks venue in Sanlitun Village, one of Beijing’s most fashionable and high-end shopping areas, is almost always jam-packed during opening hours.</p><p>“It’s a place for people who have a bit of extra money to spend,” says a 28-year-old banker who gives her name as Katyusha as she enjoys her drink. “It’s a place to show off publicly.”</p><p>“It’s seen as upmarket, even though in reality it’s not – the beans aren’t better [than those used in the US],” says Lamb. “It’s just a case of pricing and branding. People go to Starbucks because of the ‘face’ of it, because of the brand.”</p><p>There does indeed seem to be feverish Chinese appetite for Starbucks as a brand, beyond the contents of their big “Beijing” mugs that have pictures of the Great Wall of China on them. It’s common to see customers buying piles of Starbucks tat at the Beijing branches – keyrings seem particularly popular – and knockoff versions abound. Many shops in the capital stock cheap mugs bearing blurry versions of the iconic green logo.</p><p>“It’s considered a luxury product,” says Fangting Sun, a team leader at Euromonitor International who analyses the Chinese coffee chain industry. “The younger generations here love to follow the trends in the luxury industry. Starbucks got popular [early after its 1999 launch in China], then with rising disposable incomes a habit was cultivated.”</p><p>Starbucks’ social media-led marketing has been central to this habit-building. Beyond the endless Starbucks selfies being shared on WeChat, China’s enormously popular messaging app, the company recently launched a gifting service on the app that allows users to pay for a drink for a friend, who can redeem it in store.</p><p>Starbucks also now accepts payment for normal transactions through WeChat and has launched quirky functions such as one that suggests a style of drink to buy, sent along with a song, when a user tells Starbucks what mood they are in via an app. The latter is a measure that could turn off many cynical consumers in the West, but has only bolstered Starbucks’ brand power in China.</p><h3>Premium and desirable</h3><p>“The concept of marketing is newer here,” says Lamb. “There’s no actual direct translation to Chinese from English of the word ‘marketing’. Things such as the WeChat mood function would come across as gimmicky in the West but here, as a tailored, personalised thing, it was really effective. The Chinese weren’t sceptical about it.”</p><p>Similarly, in the West Starbucks, for all its success, is often seen as the ultimate symbol of capitalism – the company’s name almost a buzzword for soulless corporate America. In China this kind of backlash just hasn’t happened.</p><p>Here, although a rise in the number of boutique coffee shops suggests there is also an increasing taste for less mainstream palates, the middle classes overwhelmingly seem to regard capitalism as something positive and aspirational.</p><p>It comes as little surprise then that Starbucks is set to hit overdrive on its premium branding efforts by launching a series of ‘roasteries’. These are higher-end branches designed to be trendy meeting places, a bit more swish than its standard coffee shops.</p><p>Wong has described the forthcoming Shanghai branch, which promises an “immersive, all-sensory experience” as a “second Disneyland in Shanghai. It’s going to attract not only people in Shanghai, but also a lot of tourists in China.”</p><p>This all makes sense to Chen, as does Starbucks’ general plan to double up the number of outlets in China within five years. Although Wong has mentioned tier-one and two cities as Starbucks’ likely main targets, the potential beyond the biggest urban hubs is enormous.</p><h3>Craving cool stuff</h3><p>“China’s coffee house market is far from saturated,” says Chen. In a report on the industry released last December, her firm Mintel found that 35% of coffee consumers in tier two and three cities in China were heavy users of coffee houses, compared to 53% for tier one cities such as Beijing and Shanghai.</p><p>“This gap shows great room for expansion in the use of coffee houses in lower tier cities,” says Chen. “In fact, consumers from lower-tier cities crave trendy coffee house brands. They’ve been informed of new cool stuff happening in the bigger cities and are eager to experience it for themselves. In August 2016, when Starbucks opened its first store in Deyang, a tier-three city, consumers lined up from 6am.”</p><p>Starbucks’ China expansion, and that of the coffee house market it leads, is looking less like a bet and more like a chocolate chip cookie slam dunk.  </p>\n  </td><td valign=\"top\">  <p> </p>\n  </td>\n</tr>\n\n</table>\n","layout":{"landscape":{"id":"am-dp1-layout7","link":"story-landscape-layout4.html"},"portrait":{"id":"am-dp1-layout8","link":"story-portrait-layout4.html"}},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":"","link_source":"","image":[{"id":"2078e82b4be155061dbe16f3f8a5b354","name":"Briefing_coffee","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://fcsi-live.audiencemedia.com/var/fcsi/storage/images/media2/images/briefing_coffee3/45995-1-eng-GB/briefing_coffee_story_img_size_768x0.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"768","height":"707","is_default":true},{"id":"2078e82b4be155061dbe16f3f8a5b354","name":"Briefing_coffee","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://fcsi-live.audiencemedia.com/var/fcsi/storage/images/media2/images/briefing_coffee3/45995-1-eng-GB/briefing_coffee_story_img_size_1024x0.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"1024","height":"943","is_default":false}],"url_alias":"http://fcsi-live.audiencemedia.com","type":"story","order":"0","folio_number":"","folio_numbers":"","pdf_page_index":"0","thumbnail":"http://fcsi-live.audiencemedia.com/var/fcsi/storage/images/media2/images/briefing_coffee3/45995-1-eng-GB/briefing_coffee_tablet_story_thumbnail.jpg","color":"B12B46","real_id":"6395","main_section_id":"757","ads":[]},{"id":"f0cd0b6bb3be2d24222749a28d75a7a7","title":"The Asian health kick","sub_title":"","author":[{"id":"0","name":"Tina Paw","email":"tina.paw@progressivecp.com","is_default":false}],"tag":"","strap_line":"Healthy eating","intro":"All across Asia people are embracing healthy eating habits, turning to low-fat, low-sugar, plant-based and organic options. Maida Pineda reports on the foodservice response","body":"<table class=\"default\" cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\">\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">  <p class=\"dropcap\">Singapore ushered in the year of the Rooster with a big bang. It aired Kung Fu Fighter, Hidden Sugar, a 90-second video on the evils of sugar in New Year goodies. Just two days after it was posted on the gov.sg’s Facebook page it had garnered one million views and over 17,000 shares.</p><p>The festive season of Chinese New Year is known for heavy consumption of sweets such as pineapple tarts and bakwa (salty-sweet dried meat). This educational campaign is part of the Singapore government’s war on diabetes, which affects 440,000 Singaporeans.</p><p>In the US, kale and avocado on toast have become iconic foods for a growing population committed to healthy eating. Clean eating, Paleo, low sugar, low carb, vegan and gluten free are just a few of the buzzwords among the Western health community. While these words may not roll easily off their tongues, more Asians are also making healthier food choices.</p><h3>Growing awareness</h3><p>Healthy eating in Asia is no longer a niche market limited to high-earning, gym-going urban professionals in Hong Kong and Singapore. “It started with this group, but it is now expanding and growing,” says Clara Ming Pi FCSI. The rise in diabetes and obesity is a real concern now in Asia. This was the focus of Pi’s plenary presentation at last year’s joint conference in Kuala Lumpur for the Malaysian Dietetics’ Association (MDA) and American Overseas Dietetic Association (AODA). She believes more countries will benefit from educational campaigns like the initiative from the Singapore government, positively affecting the health of people as well as the planet.</p><p>Restaurants and food manufacturers in Asia have started focusing on creating healthier food options. In 2013, Euromonitor Research observed how Asia leads as the fastest-growing market for health and wellness packaged goods and beverages, namely in China, Indonesia, Vietnam, Thailand, and India. Nielsen’s 2014 global report on snacking attributes the growing worldwide demand for healthy food partly to factors like rising affluence in developing countries. The 2015 Euromarket International cites China and India among the fastest growing market for biscuits and snack bars, including breakfast muesli and granola bars.</p><p>In China, organic food is gaining interest among the rising middle class, without interventions from the government. More Chinese families are seeing the benefit of investing a portion of their increasing incomes on better food choices rather than luxury goods.</p><h3>Changing traditions</h3><p>Mintel observed a 17% increase in food and drink launches with functional claims in Southeast Asia between 2011 and 2014, indicating importance of health and wellness in making food choices. Seeing the growth potential in high nutrition in Asia, trend forecaster Stefan Hajkowicz is pushing New Zealand to increase exports to the region. In China where many are wary of tainted food products, New Zealand already has a great reputation for dairy products. It won’t be a stretch expanding to other healthy food products.</p><p>In Singapore, McDonald’s launched a vegetarian burger made of green peas, carrots, green beans, red peppers and potatoes last August, making it a permanent item on their menu. One QSR concept quickly growing in the region is Salad Stop! It began in Singapore in 2009 as a revolutionary movement towards health and wellbeing. Today, it prides itself on being the first and largest healthy food chain in Asia operating in Singapore, Manila, Jakarta and Tokyo. Catering to the local palate, the salads are inspired by flavours such as Oh Crab Lah! – a nod to Singapore’s chili crab – and Jai Ho! – with free-range tandoori chicken and Indian spices. With a freshness commitment of 72 hours from earth to bowl, ingredients are sourced from local partners.</p><p>“Whether people are going vegan for animal welfare, health or environmental reasons there’s no doubt there’s a surge in vegan foods popping up in restaurants all over Asia,” says Jason Barker, vice president of PETA Asia. “Our recently released list of the top 10 vegan-friendly cities in Asia proves there is a huge demand for plant-based foods across the continent and businesses are catching on. From vegan isaw (chicken intestines) at Greenery Kitchen in Manila to all-vegan bakeries such as Veganerie in Bangkok and Vegan Heaven in Taipei, businesses are finding new, cruelty-free, healthy ways to re-create traditional favourites without using meat or dairy products.” Barker reports large crowds at all-vegan festivals in Hong Kong, Taipei, Bali, Bangkok, Ho Chi Minh City, Singapore, Tokyo, and the Philippines. There’s even an all-vegan supermarket in Taiwan, as well as a meat-free supermarket in Hong Kong.</p><h3>Local options</h3><p>Although Asians are gradually becoming more mindful of cruelty to animals, Barker believes many shift to a plant-based diet for health reasons. “Plant foods contain no cholesterol, whereas meat, eggs and dairy products contain large amounts of cholesterol and saturated fat,” he explains. “Approximately 90% of Asians are lactose-intolerant, meaning that their bodies cannot break down the sugar in milk, which can result in symptoms such as acne, cramps, bloating and diarrhoea.”</p><p>There are many ways for manufacturers and restaurants to cater to Asia’s growing health food market. Pi sees an opportunity in producing and delivering healthy food to schools, office buildings and facilities. In Hong Kong, this has already taken off. The healthy food delivery scene is a growing business with at least 15 companies creating and delivering customised meal plans for professionals.</p><p>As more Asians embrace a healthier diet, they need not consume imported kale from the US or quinoa from South America. Pi emphasises the importance of using local healthy ingredients, “It’s not only cheaper and fresher, but reduces the carbon footprint of food.”  </p>\n  </td><td valign=\"top\">  <p> </p>\n  </td>\n</tr>\n\n</table>\n","layout":{"landscape":{"id":"am-dp1-layout7","link":"story-landscape-layout4.html"},"portrait":{"id":"am-dp1-layout8","link":"story-portrait-layout4.html"}},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":"","link_source":"","image":[{"id":"1514fa7e638704efc003bbdf833e047b","name":"Briefing_Healthy2","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://fcsi-live.audiencemedia.com/var/fcsi/storage/images/media2/images/briefing_healthy23/45794-1-eng-GB/briefing_healthy2_story_img_size_768x0.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"768","height":"707","is_default":true},{"id":"1514fa7e638704efc003bbdf833e047b","name":"Briefing_Healthy2","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://fcsi-live.audiencemedia.com/var/fcsi/storage/images/media2/images/briefing_healthy23/45794-1-eng-GB/briefing_healthy2_story_img_size_1024x0.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"1024","height":"943","is_default":false}],"url_alias":"http://fcsi-live.audiencemedia.com","type":"story","order":"1","folio_number":"","folio_numbers":"","pdf_page_index":"0","thumbnail":"http://fcsi-live.audiencemedia.com/var/fcsi/storage/images/media2/images/briefing_healthy23/45794-1-eng-GB/briefing_healthy2_tablet_story_thumbnail.jpg","color":"B12B46","real_id":"6312","main_section_id":"757","ads":[]},{"id":"b7e2d19aec57285ac470ac39ec5e7ebf","title":"Taking care","sub_title":"","author":[{"id":"0","name":"Tina Paw","email":"tina.paw@progressivecp.com","is_default":false}],"tag":"","strap_line":"The FCSI interview","intro":"Christine Guyott FCSI RD recently received Foodservice Equipment Reports’ Industry Service Award. She tells Michael Jones about her career","body":"<table class=\"default\" cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\">\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">  <p class=\"dropcap\">I didn’t have any goals when I was young; no princess goals or anything. I didn’t know what I wanted to be when I grew up. I still don’t know what I want to be when I grow up,” laughs Christine Guyott.</p><p>We meet in Orlando, Florida, during the NAFEM 2017 Show on the day she is due to be honoured with FER magazine’s prestigious Industry Service Award. Princess goals notwithstanding, Guyott, a hugely respected consultant in the healthcare sector in particular and a principal of Rippe Associates, has certainly made a lasting impression on the industry.</p><p>Guyott grew up in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Her first hospitality experience was when her parents owned a bar in the north of the state. “They didn’t have a lot of foodservice, but it was a fun place to grow up,” she says.</p><p>Having attended school in Minneapolis, the expectation for Guyott and her peers was “to move away and go to a good college.” She ended up in Pepperdine University in California. “In high school I took Spanish for five years, adding Japanese for the last two years. I really liked languages and I wanted to travel. I thought I was going to be an international business person,” she smiles.</p><h3>The easy science</h3><p>As a freshman, in order to receive grant money Guyott worked on campus in the housing department. “I had to register before everyone else in school, and somebody said: “Take Nutrition – it’s the easy science.” So I did and I fell in love with it. My professors were fabulous. It was a small programme; our classes were four or five people. It was a great learning experience,” she says.</p><p>One of the reasons Guyott believes she broke into consulting at the age of 27 was due to one of her college professors having a relationship with Clevenger Nutritional Services, the management advisory service (MAS) arm of Clevenger Associates in California. In her senior year at college Guyott went to work at Clevenger in their office on Ocean Avenue in Santa Monica. It was a formative experience Guyott describes as “the coolest thing.”</p><p>At the end of her studies the next step for Guyott was to become a registered dietician, which required an internship. “I applied to all the California internships, which were the hardest to get into. In my first year I didn’t get a match, so Clevenger had me stay on there for a year. So I worked with them pulling cut sheets, selecting equipment and writing specs. We had some fabulous projects. One of them was a design project for the University of California, designing nutritional lab kitchens. I was able to help pick out materials. It was a lot of fun.”</p><p>A year later Guyott was matched into the Mayo Clinic internship programme at St Mary’s campus in Rochester, Minnesota. “It was probably one of the best internships on offer. I even got a stipend, which is unheard of. I lived in the hospital for a year. It was amazing,” she says.</p><p>Call it fate, or pure luck, but Guyott had inadvertently stumbled across a foodservice sector that would ultimately prove to shape and inspire her more than any other. “My big passion is healthcare,” she says. “Mayo was a huge influence. You see all these incredible healing experiences and world-renowned doctors. It’s overwhelming and it just takes you in.”</p><p>Guyott soon found the healthcare sector appealed to her methodical way of working, but ultimately she found the day-to-day role of nutritional support dietician “too repetitive” to consider it as a career. “I got very frustrated. Every day was exactly the same. It wasn’t something I could have done long term,” she says.</p><h3>Customer focus</h3><p>Guyott sat her dietician’s registration exam, moving back to Minneapolis-St Paul and working for nine months at Women Infants and Children’s (WIC) Program, a community initiative distributing vouchers for underprivileged mothers. By now though, she was looking for a career position. She started working for the foodservice distributor Sysco Minnesota in a healthcare sales specialist job.</p><p>“The role just looked right up my alley,” she says. “We weren’t directly responsible for sales, but we got to help the sales people. A lot of them came from the restaurant industry, so they didn’t know how to speak the healthcare language. So we helped them.”</p><p>While Guyott had felt frustrated working on the clinical side of healthcare, on the commercial side she felt very much appreciated. “We would come up with menus, teach classes, do ‘in-services’ for their staff and teach them about food safety or portioning. Every day was different. It was challenging and interesting.”</p><p>Guyott admits she has been an introvert from a young age. “I was so shy when I was growing up that I couldn’t answer the phone. I couldn’t speak to people. This has improved, but even at the FCSI Symposium this week I wanted to ask a question, so I raised my hand and my heart just went crazy,” she laughs.</p><p>The Sysco role, however, proved to be pivotal in sparking an interest in how to communicate effectively with customers. “At Sysco it was about just talking to people. I wasn’t trying to sell them anything – I was just helping them. A lot of the time customers were in small nursing homes in the middle of North Dakota. They loved visitors and appreciated the help, so I think it’s what fostered my interest in wanting to work with customers. That’s the part of my job that I love today.”</p><p>In 1991 one of Guyott’s clients at Sysco told her the Minnesota-based consultancy Rippe Associates were hiring. “She said there was a lot of travel but that I might be interested in it. And so here I was, with Bob [Rippe, the firm’s founder] and Terry [Pellegrino FCSI, principal] in an interview and I’m back into a consulting firm. There was only one in my tri-state area. I just think it was what I was supposed to be. How odd that you have consulting experience at college, which is a one in a million shot, right? And then you end up working for 20-odd years for a consulting firm,” she says.</p><p>Guyott began working with Pellegrino on K-12, schools, university and corrections projects as an operations consultant. This role was a combination of design and MAS, she suggests. “We went to the meetings with the principal and would be the communication person with the foodservice directors. We’d be the prime communicator on meeting records and would write specifications and meet with all the manufacturers to hear about their equipment. I enjoyed it straightaway,” she says.</p><p>“I can’t remember the first two years, it was just overwhelming,” she says. “I was on a couple of projects with Bob from a healthcare standpoint and after several years he would introduce me as the COO of the healthcare team. So I began working with Bob and then pretty much solely on healthcare after that, which felt comfortable to me.”</p><h3>The best of health</h3><p>Rippe instilled confidence in Guyott, which she thrived on. “He did nothing but support me and tell people how useful I was. I think it helped a lot when it came to the transition of his retirement. People were already thinking of me as Bob’s right hand person,” she says.</p><p>Pellegrino, meanwhile proved to be a mentor in another significant way, taking the time to teach Guyott how to draw project designs. “It was on Terry’s team that I would draw schools. Because schools are straightforward, laying those out was a good starting point. She was just really gracious. She didn’t tell you it sucked,” she laughs.</p><p>Allying the methodical, problem-solving element of project management work, which Guyott feels “fits that side of my dietician brain” with the creative aspect of design provides “a perfect blend” in her career, she says: “It takes a long time to learn how to be a consultant. And it’s hard to be the expert in the room until you have the experience behind you. I started when I was 28, I just listened and tried to observe as much as I could. I was scared to death because there was no formal training, so I worked and worked.”</p><p>Approximately 80% of Guyott’s work is now healthcare oriented, from a long-standing project with Stanford Hospitals and Clinics to smaller North Pine critical access hospital in Minnesota. The rest of her work is mainly K-12 projects. Under Guyott’s management, Rippe Associates are working on 30 or so projects at any one time. “All different levels – some are design, some are feasibility studies. Some are in construction administration, which doesn’t take as much of my time,” she says.</p><h3>Talent and passion</h3><p>Guyott believes one of the biggest challenges the industry faces is developing its talent pools, both on the operator and the design side. As someone who helped reinvigorate FCSI’s Council for Emerging Consultants (formerly ICON) Committee, which attracts and mentors younger consultants, she believes passionately that FCSI has an important role to play in this regard for the future of the profession.“I think it elevates us as professionals. When you have a professional organisation that holds its members to standards, it makes everybody else rise up,” she says.</p><p>“Our biggest competitors are dealers, and what do we have to offer that a dealer doesn’t? We are fee based and we aren’t selling equipment, so it can be a tough sell,” she continues. “When somebody can get design drawings for free versus paying, you have to educate. I often find myself saying to architects: ‘Would you want your client to hire the furniture salesperson to lay out your building? No. Do you want the equipment sales guy to lay out the kitchen? No’.”</p><p>Guyott’s passion for seeking constant improvement in the industry she loves remains undimmed – a princess goal if ever there was one. “My dad always says, ‘people don’t care about how much you know unless they know how much you care’,” she smiles.</p>\n  </td><td valign=\"top\">  <p> </p><blockquote class=\"right\" ><span class=\"hide\">\"</span><p>“He [Bob Rippe] did nothing but support me and tell people how useful I was.
