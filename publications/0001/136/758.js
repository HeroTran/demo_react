Meaning that almost half a year has passed.</p><p>As per my Q1 letter, I´m happy to say that things are looking much better every day in FCSI world. Our primary concern this year was the Asia Pacific Division. After the hard work of the APD board and new incoming members taking over the direction of the Division, it looks like we will soon have a new and reinforced structure to develop APD business. This of course is very pleasing to everyone and as it should have always been.</p><p>APD is full of activities this year with trade shows in New Delhi, Shanghai, Hong Kong, Beijing, Chengdu, Mumbai and Sydney. I hope several of you can be part of the shows in which our Society is putting forth a big effort.</p><p>At the beginning of April all eyes were on the FCSI EAME 2017 Conference, which was held in one of the most beautiful cities in the world – Vienna, Austria. Many members turned up to participate and enjoy the fantastic music that the city offers as well as the famous Sacher Torte. The conference planning committee in EAME Division prepared a wonderful programme of events.</p><p>In May a highly respected panel of professionals, including several FCSI members will be introducing the ACE Awards at the HOFEX Show in Hong Kong. This year I plan to attend every show, especially in the APD Division, to try to meet as many members as I can.</p><p>As always if there is something I need to do to make your FCSI membership more valuable please do not hesitate to contact me at william@fcsi.org or our executive director Nick Vaccaro at nick@fcsi.org. We will do all we possibly can to help you out.</p><p>Please never forget that FCSI is all about sharing knowledge, supporting the members and inspiring the industry</p><p> </p>\n<div class=\"object-left\">\t\t\n    \n                <div class=\"imageleft\">\n    \n    \n                                                                                                                                    \n\n                                <img src=\"/var/fcsi/storage/images/media2/images/bill-taunton8/42370-1-eng-GB/bill-taunton_web640.png\" width=\"640\"  alt=\"BILL TAUNTON\" title=\"BILL TAUNTON\" />\n                                    \n    \n            </div>\n    \n    </div><p> </p><p> </p><aside class=\" author\">\n\t<p> </p><p class=\"highlight\"><b>WILLIAM TAUNTON FCSI</b></p><p class=\"highlight\">President, FCSI Worldwide</p><p class=\"highlight\">william@fcsi.org</p><p> </p>\n</aside>\n  </td><td valign=\"top\">  <h2><b>FROM THE REGIONAL CHAIR</b></h2><p><b>2017 continues to be a challenging year for FCSI Asia Pacific.</b> The FCSI APD Board has made every effort to increase member participation and involvement across all APD activities with a view to establishing a more sustainable operating model.</p><p>Member response to requests for board nominations and committee involvement, and participation in a member feedback survey was below expectation. However, on a positive note there is strong support for a China/Asia Chapter and interest in reinvigorating the ANZC Chapter.</p><p>The majority of APD members have indicated a preference for integration with EAME and discussions have been held with input from the Worldwide Board, EAME and TAD. The existing APD Board are now in the process of drafting a recommendation, which will be presented to members at the APD AGM to be held in Hong Kong on 8 May at HOFEX 2017.</p><p>The process will be in compliance with the APD bylaws and with the APD affiliation agreement with FCSI Worldwide Board and APD members will be given the opportunity to vote. It is likely that a new operating model would come into effect for 2018.</p><p>APD enjoyed significant success at the recent Hotelex Shanghai show with more than 200 attendees at the public education forum showcasing APD China members. UBM, the organiser for multiple HOTELEX trade shows, recently acquired Allworld, the organiser for HOFEX Hong Kong and FHA Singapore. APD is proud to be a collaborative partner with UBM to expand the public education forums and equipment awards to bring benefits for our membership and HOFEX Hong Kong (8-11 May 2017) will feature an FCSI APD judging panel for the 2017 ACE (Asian Catering Equipment) award.</p><p>These small, but incremental, steps continue to promote the FCSI brand in the foodservice industry.</p><p>We share, we support, we inspire.</p><p> </p><p> </p><aside class=\" author\">\n\t<p> </p><p> </p>\n<div class=\"object-center\">\t\t\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                    \n\n                                <img src=\"/var/fcsi/storage/images/media2/images/clara-pi-watercolour-final5/43331-1-eng-GB/clara-pi-watercolour-final_web720.png\" width=\"720\"  alt=\"Clara Pi watercolour FINAL\" title=\"Clara Pi watercolour FINAL\" />\n                                    \n    \n    \n    </div><p> </p><p class=\"highlight\"><b>CLARA MING PI FCSI</b></p><p class=\"highlight\">Interim chair</p><p class=\"highlight\">Asia Pacific Division</p><p class=\"highlight\">FCSI Worldwide board director &amp;
