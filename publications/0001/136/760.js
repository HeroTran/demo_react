Once famous for chestnuts, rice and fragrant matsutake mushrooms, the area is now more closely associated with another crop: lettuce. Inside the company’s two giant warehouses, factory workers in sterile white suits monitor the conditions in a sealed growing zone, where trays of the leafy vegetable are stacked in columns stretching four stories high.</p><p>Spread is Japan’s largest plant factory, a 3,000 sq m indoor-farming facility that turns out 21,000 heads of lettuce a day. Later this year, the company plans to open a second plant equipped with robot technology that will more than double its daily production.</p><p>Also known as vertical farms, plant factories like Spread use LED lighting and hydroponics to cultivate crops in highly controlled environments – without sunlight, soil, or pesticides. Hydroponic systems use pumps and filters to circulate a nutrient-dense solution around the roots of each plant, replacing the need for dirt and fertilisers.</p><p>In Japan, indoor agriculture has been on the rise ever since 2011, when the earthquake, tsunami and ensuing nuclear disaster that ravaged the northeastern region of Tohoku sparked concerns over food safety. According to data from the Japan Plant Factory association, the number of vertical farms operating in Japan has swelled from 34 in 2009 to 210 in 2016, and the idea is catching on across Asia, in countries such as China, Singapore, and Vietnam.</p><h3>Indoor farm incentives</h3><p>Though it sounds like a futuristic dream, the concept of soil-free farming goes back to 1940, when William Frederick Gericke, a professor at the University of California at Berkeley, published the first book about hydroponic agriculture, Complete Guide to Soilless Gardening, which he hoped would lead to world peace.</p><p>After the Second World War, the technology was introduced in Japan and used to grow around 1.5 million kg of fresh produce to alleviate shortages. The Japanese began experimenting with closed-environment growing systems in the 1950s. The scarcity of arable land, combined with a shift toward industrialisation, spurred scientists to find new ways to feed Japan’s rapidly expanding population. By the 1970s, electronics giant Hitachi, became the world’s first company to start test runs with modern plant factory technology.</p><p>In recent years, Japan’s agriculture industry has faced even greater problems, as the average age of farmers – estimated at 67 in 2016 – continues to creep up. Climate change and an increase in extreme weather events – such as the severe drought that ruined crops last year – have intensified instability, making the farming business even less attractive to the younger generation of workers. In 2008, the Japanese government launched a campaign to promote indoor agriculture. According to a report by investment firm Newbean Capital, more than half of the country’s indoor farms have received either loans or subsidies.</p><p>Spread was an early beneficiary of government support. However, when the company started operating in 2008 it struggled, finally achieving profitability in 2013. “When our products first appeared in supermarkets, plant-factory-grown vegetables weren’t yet recognised by many. Our sales staff had a hard time selling them to retail stores,” says factory manager Naohiro Oiwa, who oversees the Kameoka plant.</p><p>Spread’s representatives took pains to explain the production process, highlighting the factory’s ultra-hygienic conditions and the quality of their crops. Gradually, attitudes have shifted as more vertical farmers have entered the sector: “Now, there are more competing companies and many different retailers selling the products. There are even supermarkets with special sections devoted to plant-factory-grown vegetables,” Oiwa notes. Spread sells its four varieties of lettuce to 2,200 supermarkets across Japan, as well as directly to some restaurants and in-flight caterers.</p><h3>Complex technology</h3><p>At the new facility, artificial intelligence will automate tasks such as raising seedlings – a move that will cut labour costs by 50% and boost profitability. Spread also aims to lower energy consumption by 30% and reduce water use to a minimum. But while today’s plant factories have become much more efficient, limitations remain. Most of Japan’s plant factories grow only leafy green vegetables; other types of produce require more light and different maintenance systems to create conditions suited to each crop. Such changes require time to develop and major investment.</p><p>Mebiol, an agri-tech startup located outside Tokyo, has devised an exciting, low-cost alternative to the plant factory model. Dubbed film farming or dry farming, the system features a thin polymer membrane made of hydrogel – a material typically used in products such as disposable diapers – perforated with nano-sized pores. The technology is complex, but the idea is simple: plants absorb water and nutrients through the film’s tiny holes, which are too small for viruses, bacteria and other microbes to penetrate. The membrane’s powerful filtration properties eliminate the need for the expensive machinery that keeps water circulating in hydroponic systems, and less water is required to operate the farms. “Much of the water in hydroponic farms is lost, but we have near-zero water waste,” says Dr Yuichi Mori, the polymer physicist who invented the film farming technique.</p><p>Dry farms can be established anywhere – on city rooftops, in the desert, and even on top of contaminated land. The method is being used to grow intensely sweet tomatoes, peppers and melons in 150 locations around Japan and one in China, as well as on a farm in the middle of the desert in the UAE. Mebiol will export its technology to Europe and other countries in the Middle East later this year. A restaurant in Germany, for example, plans to implement the system on site to offer fresh vegetables harvested to order.</p><p>“I believe this technology can increase food security and make the world a better place,” Mori says. William Frederick Gericke expressed the same sentiment nearly 80 years ago. Utopia still remains a distant vision, but farming advances may help bring us one step closer.  </p>\n  </td><td valign=\"top\">  <blockquote class=\"right\" ><span class=\"hide\">\"</span><p>“There are supermarkets with special sections devoted to plant-factory-grown vegetables”</p><span class=\"hide\">\"</span></blockquote>\n\n  </td>\n</tr>\n\n</table>\n","layout":{"landscape":{"id":"am-dp1-layout1","link":"story-landscape-layout1.html"},"portrait":{"id":"am-dp1-layout2","link":"story-portrait-layout1.html"}},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":"","link_source":"","image":[{"id":"3ba02802372a2347a417fecb378bfeae","name":"transparant","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://fcsi-live.audiencemedia.com/var/fcsi/storage/images/media2/images/transparant52/42456-1-eng-GB/transparant_story_img_size_107x0.png","portrait":true,"width":"243","height":"107","is_default":true},{"id":"3ba02802372a2347a417fecb378bfeae","name":"transparant","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://fcsi-live.audiencemedia.com/var/fcsi/storage/images/media2/images/transparant52/42456-1-eng-GB/transparant_story_img_size_197x0.png","portrait":false,"width":"447","height":"197","is_default":false}],"related_objects":{"image":[{"id":"06a22f7b3f3ac524fd60a70d0fd22c60","name":"Lead","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://fcsi-live.audiencemedia.com/var/fcsi/storage/images/media2/images/lead9/45682-1-eng-GB/lead_story_img_size_107x0.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"116","height":"107"},{"id":"06a22f7b3f3ac524fd60a70d0fd22c60","name":"Lead","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://fcsi-live.audiencemedia.com/var/fcsi/storage/images/media2/images/lead9/45682-1-eng-GB/lead_story_img_size_197x0.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"214","height":"197"}]},"url_alias":"http://fcsi-live.audiencemedia.com","type":"story","order":"5","folio_number":"","folio_numbers":"","pdf_page_index":"0","thumbnail":"http://fcsi-live.audiencemedia.com/var/fcsi/storage/images/media2/images/transparant52/42456-1-eng-GB/transparant_tablet_story_thumbnail.png","color":"A8A89F","real_id":"6318","main_section_id":"760","ads":[]},{"id":"ae80bb6ad79d4d2f20598caefd2a1a56","title":"“I like using the power of networking”","sub_title":"In my view","author":[{"id":"0","name":"Tina Paw","email":"tina.paw@progressivecp.com","is_default":false}],"tag":"","strap_line":"In my view","intro":"FCSI associate Kathleen M.

A lot of the time we chefs take not just solace, but pride, in that fact. Our reputation is one of a bunch of fighters. Individuals you would want next to you in the trenches. A brigade of “work hard, play harder” types. Our industry runs on a fuel of macho posturing and bravado. We try to out-do each other with tales of the hours we work, how little sleep we get, the cuts and burns we have sustained. We exist in a perpetual purgatory that is out of sync with the normal world – where everyone else lives, works, sleeps and eats.</p><p>This limbo is appealing for a while. It attracts non-conformists and outliers – pirates is a neat description. We take comfort in our differences and accept shortcomings in others, providing they can work hard. Perhaps we were no good at school. Maybe we dislike the boxes we found ourselves in. In any case, a lot of us find acceptance in a kitchen.</p><p>Sustaining this level of intensity can lead to some dark places. I’ve endured dark times, both personally and vicariously: a junior sommelier who turned up for work high on ketamine; a waitress whose wild mood swings and occasionally violent behaviour were eventually explained by marking the bottle of vodka behind the bar; an assistant manager who emerged from the bathroom twice a night far more talkative than he had been three minutes before and another whose fondness for alcohol had caused him to kill someone, when driving his car, two years previously.</p><p>I’ve heard tales of high-end kitchens where tough Saturday nights are completed thanks to lines being chopped out in the pastry kitchen and a multi-starred, world-renowned chef whose PA would wipe his nose before a dining room stroll.</p><p>With a pervading atmosphere of pressure and, regrettably often, bullying, it’s no wonder such self-medication occurs. With late nights, early mornings and long hours it’s a miracle we don’t hear of more tales such as that of Bernard Loiseau who committed suicide in 2003 or Benoit Violier who killed himself just last year.</p><p>At the top end the pressures can be greater. You may not have to worry about being publicly reprimanded by your sous chef, but the financial pressures of maintaining a good reputation on razor-thin margins are considerable. I know how easy it is to flirt with mental health difficulties. At its worst, driving to work would make me feel physically sick, my heart racing and breathing shallow. Checking the bank account needed time and courage. I developed hives and skin problems – dormant allergies thriving during a time of emotional weakness. At work I had to maintain a veneer, but at home it cracked. Sleep, when it came, was blessed relief, but it was superficial and pitted with lurid dreams. I needed to work more to increase turnover, but the more I worked the less effective I became. The cycle was brutal and relentless. Depression is not merely being at your lowest ebb, it’s being unable to see a way out.</p><p>A break came at the right time. We closed down for three weeks and I confirmed a decision I’d made a year before. It was time to move on. And in six months time I’m closing my restaurant and will do so with pride and grace. Suppliers and staff will be paid and I can walk away knowing I did my very best.</p><p>Others aren’t so fortunate. Addiction, depression and bullying are rife and the industry has to embrace change to survive. We’ve taken baby steps but there are far greater strides that need to be made.</p>\n  </td>\n</tr>\n\n</table>\n","layout":{"landscape":{"id":"am-dp1-layout1b","link":"story-landscape-layout1b.html"},"portrait":{"id":"am-dp1-layout2b","link":"story-portrait-layout1b.html"}},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":"","link_source":"","image":[{"id":"3453afcb86f18fa5ec66e7e174dae3dd","name":"transparant","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://fcsi-live.audiencemedia.com/var/fcsi/storage/images/media2/images/transparant54/42518-1-eng-GB/transparant_story_img_size_107x0.png","portrait":true,"width":"243","height":"107","is_default":true},{"id":"3453afcb86f18fa5ec66e7e174dae3dd","name":"transparant","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://fcsi-live.audiencemedia.com/var/fcsi/storage/images/media2/images/transparant54/42518-1-eng-GB/transparant_story_img_size_197x0.png","portrait":false,"width":"447","height":"197","is_default":false}],"related_objects":{"image":[{"id":"ea98deb6ed1f1e367339b47cce43bc3b","name":"secret chef","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://fcsi-live.audiencemedia.com/var/fcsi/storage/images/media2/images/secret-chef3/45689-1-eng-GB/secret-chef_web250.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"250","height":"230"},{"id":"ea98deb6ed1f1e367339b47cce43bc3b","name":"secret chef","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://fcsi-live.audiencemedia.com/var/fcsi/storage/images/media2/images/secret-chef3/45689-1-eng-GB/secret-chef_web250.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"250","height":"230"}]},"url_alias":"http://fcsi-live.audiencemedia.com","type":"story","order":"7","folio_number":"","folio_numbers":"","pdf_page_index":"0","thumbnail":"http://fcsi-live.audiencemedia.com/var/fcsi/storage/images/media2/images/transparant54/42518-1-eng-GB/transparant_tablet_story_thumbnail.png","color":"A8A89F","real_id":"6322","main_section_id":"760","ads":[]}],"type":null,"ads":[]}}
