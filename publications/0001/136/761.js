Now, his sights are set higher still","body":"<table class=\"default\" cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\">\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">  <p class=\"dropcap\">Exuding an infectious joie de vivre, Vehbi Varlik describes some of his interests. “I participate in a variety of activities – as much as my time allows. Swimming is a pleasure for me. I ski during the winter, I go to football matches frequently and I get a massage whenever I have the opportunity.”</p><p>Varlik’s greatest passion by far, however, is his work. “I love working. I am happy spending time and energy at work.” Being born in Kosovo (then part of Yugoslavia), followed by a move to Bursa, Turkey, at the age of six presented its fair share of adversity, but also, as Varlik explains, cultivated a belief in the value of perseverance. “I have worked night and day in order to realise my dreams. I had no other chance of success as my childhood was difficult. My then partner and I gained our reputation in Bursa and neighbouring cities with our work and faith and, gradually, expanded over to Anatolia”.</p><p>Born in 1951, Varlik began his foodservice career in 1971, balancing his mechanical engineering studies with a job in kitchen provision. Varlik’s career trajectory reflects his high-level aspirations. He started as a draughtsman before founding his first business in 1977 and setting up Inoksan three years later. He has been there ever since, serving variously as advisory board member, president and chairman.</p><p>The list of people Varlik admires reinforces the centrality of aspiration to his work ethic. In addition to Turkish businessmen such as Ishak Alaton, Üzeyir Garih and Sarik Tara, his heroes include friend and Ali Group chairman Luciano Berti, Goldman Sachs CEO and chairman Lloyd Blankfein and US business magnate Bill Gates. Success, Varlik explains, is the uniting theme. “I have always read books and biographies of successful business people. I still continue to watch people around me and above me,” he says.</p><h3><b>Hunger for success</b></h3><p>When Varlik founded Inoksan in 1980 with his business partner, Coskun Irfan, the pair placed this hunger for success at the heart of their new company by prioritising innovation from the outset. “We kept on working, always aiming for the best and never giving up. The right strategy, innovative R&amp;D, proper marketing and investment in technology are the most essential elements of our success story. Since the very first day we have placed great emphasis on innovation and technology when manufacturing kitchen equipment. We continue growing, striving to be the best in all we do, without compromising that entrepreneurial spirit.”</p><p>It’s a philosophy that has yielded impressive results. Varlik’s claim of having “marked down some considerable successes in our industry” is a modest take on a stunning entrepreneurial journey. Inoksan is now a truly global company, exporting 35% of its products to 80 countries across five continents. All of this is done from the firm’s vast 20,000 sq m (24,000 sq yd) industrial home in Bursa. In addition to “countless projects” in its Turkish base, Inoksan boasts an impressive list of international clients, including Google’s Brazil HQ, Hilton Baku, Abu Dhabi National Oil Company HQ, Sheraton Jumeirah Beach Hotel in Dubai, the Baku Olympic Stadium, InterContinental Dubai Marina, Radisson Tbilisi and Taj Hotel Yeshwantpur, India.</p><p>“We started with our dream,” says Varlik, “and today we’re one of the leading industry names specialising in commercial kitchens in our country. We have succeeded in making a name for ourselves in the global market as well and it makes us proud.”</p><p>Inoksan’s growth as a company echoes Varlik’s own life story: an ascent to success from humble beginnings, guided by a belief in perseverance as the key to success.</p><p>No stranger to hardship after a tough upbringing, Varlik recalls that the challenges of his youth were mirrored in the prejudice Inoksan faced during its early forays into the corporate world. “The fact we were offering ‘Turkish products’ meant we were not welcomed easily. Turkey’s image was undermined by exports from some of its more unprofessional companies. Foreigners tended to perceive Turkish products as low quality. They expected us to offer special prices before considering us.”</p><p>Over time this prejudice abated, thanks to a combination of Turkey’s strengthened global standing and the perseverance of Varlik and his colleagues. “We attended many exhibitions and travelled the globe. Turgut Ozal, prime minister of Turkey from 1983, started the movement to open Turkey up to the world and our country’s image gradually improved. Political support means Turkey is now much better known globally, especially in the manufacturing industry. Confidence in Turkish companies and our products has increased considerably – Turkey is a respectable country in the world of business.”</p><p>The auspicious business climate provided just the right conditions for Inoksan’s tremendous growth. It is now a seven-company-strong group, with regional offices in six major cities and almost 40 authorised dealers across Turkey – not to mention 80 sales points abroad. Varlik explains the firm’s overarching strategy has been crucial in facilitating this rapid expansion. “Inoksan’s marketing function has provided stability over the years, helped by specialist management staff and employee teams. We aim to be in constant interaction with our target consumer group on an online and offline basis through advertising, participation in events and exhibitions, sponsorships and other campaigns.”</p><h3><b>Ambitious company growth</b></h3><p>Following Coskun Irfan’s departure from the company in 2013, Varlik’s role in establishing this strategy was enhanced as he took on his former partner’s 40% stake in the business. “We were in partnership for 33 years,” Varlik says. “But Mr Coskun also had other companies he established years ago and he wanted to manage those companies – that’s why we took the decision in parallel.”</p><p>Such a change in the company’s structure marked a significant shift for Inoksan after three decades of joint ownership, but Varlik has big plans. The 35% export figure is just the beginning: “it is our goal to raise that to 50% by 2023. We want to focus on the global arena and enhance our worldwide recognition.”</p><p>As Varlik explains, this means focusing on the best opportunities for growth. “We want to make an impact in Azerbaijan just like we made here in Turkey. We’re also targeting the Middle East, and plan to have a more efficient role in the US, where we have had activities for a while.”</p><p>These are bold ambitions for an already well-established company. Does Inoksan have the tools for success? Varlik answers with a firm ‘yes’. “One thing should be clearly stated here, Inoksan will become a global trademark by growing stronger – undertaking unique projects in addition to innovative products being created by Turkish engineers, pushing up standards worldwide. Each product coming out of Turkey under the Inoksan brand is very assertive in competition.”</p><p>It’s not hard to see Varlik’s underlying philosophy at play as he describes his plans for the future. “What most successful people have in common is hard work. This is a never-ending process, from which you always learn,” he says.</p><p>Inoksan is perhaps best known for its prolific inventiveness. The figures speak for themselves; the company has six patents, patents utility models and 22 design registrations – its product range is a list of innovations that have marked upheavals in foodservice efficiency.</p><p>“Innovative and unique products of our trademark include combi steamers manufactured to meet international standards and promote good health. They offer cost advantages thanks to savings from energy consumption,” says Varlik. “Standardisation of hygiene and safety systems helps our cooking equipment stand out. Our doner kebab machines are ergonomically designed, meeting hygiene conditions and offering increased functions for quality cooking. We have also made considerable technological progress in our warewashers in recent years.”</p><p>And there’s more to come. “I believe our new generation of combi steamers, which we plan to launch this year, will make an impact on the global arena,” he says.</p><p>Innovative manufacturing is combined with Inoksan’s company ethic, balancing original products with a strong emphasis on customer service. “I can say without doubt that we offer unconditional and full support during post-sales and post-project stages. All this makes us proud to describe ourselves as a leading company in the industry.”</p><h3><b>Customer service</b></h3><p>After-sales service, practically a business all of its own at Inoksan, is a particularly gratifying aspect of the company’s operations for Varlik. In addition to the firm’s 400 service staff, introducing “the first professional call centre in the industry” in 2015 was a landmark moment. “The distance between us and our customers is just 12 seconds,” he says.</p><p>The changes Varlik has overseen, and his ambitions for the future, show this is a company continuing to grow. But with this growth comes new challenges. It’s hard to see how Inoksan can maintain the dynamism underpinning its past successes while juggling the growing bureaucratic demands associated with being an established company. Is the prospect of losing this dynamism a worry?</p><p>Not for Varlik. A company structure based on delegation and trust is designed to insulate Inoksan from the threat of new challenges, with the board of directors nurturing the “free discretion” of their juniors to ensure macro-strategies are implemented effectively. “When you assign such responsibility and freedom to your operational units you don’t lose flexibility and pace no matter how much you grow,” he says.</p><p>This flexibility is indispensable in the broader context of the foodservice industry, which has changed so much since Inoksan’s founding in 1980. Varlik puts technological development at the heart of this change, precipitating new product profiles, altering the technology base of manufacturing and revolutionising the concept of the foodservice industry itself.</p><p>Nevertheless, the firm’s philosophy has remained the same: prioritising innovation to reach new heights. Inoksan continues to devote 2% of yearly turnover to R&amp;D, a policy that has allowed it to remain ahead of the curve in an industry characterised by rapid evolution. “Concepts of innovation, R&amp;D and technology are the keys to our long-term success,” says Varlik. This has meant heavy investment in keeping production and management staff up to speed as well as a keen eye on the latest technological developments.</p><p>Changes in the company, industry evolution and ambitious plans for growth mean Varlik is busier than ever before. “I was the operational leader for many years,” he explains. “Now, I have adapted and am getting used to strategic leading.” Straddling operations and strategy in Inoksan’s vast empire means each day is packed with a range of tasks; reports to read, meetings with general managers and attending wider industry events are just some of Varlik’s daily chores.</p><p>However, a burgeoning foodservice industry means Varlik’s all-seeing role is increasingly vital. When Inoksan first started, the company’s global prestige was damaged by Turkey’s weak reputation for foodservice. Now it is a foodservice hub, becoming more vibrant all the time. This creates new opportunities, but also unprecedented challenges as local competitors gain ground on their established forebears. “I think our industry has matured to a certain extent,” reflects Varlik. “Turkey has gained superiority in the commercial kitchen market compared to other countries in the region. Now we are chasing Spain and have even reached a level where we can compete with them.”</p><h3><b>Increased competition</b></h3><p>The political and economical climate presents challenges of a different kind to firms pursuing growth. This climate is particularly volatile in the Middle East; Varlik still sees the region as ripe for “considerable business” but concedes that stagnant oil prices could create “serious economic problems in the next two to three years”.</p><p>As ever, Varlik’s plan is to persevere. The Middle East may be his home region, but he is upbeat about opportunities further afield, which he predicts will become more significant than ever, both for Inoksan and the whole industry. “US and Asian markets will be important for us over the next five years, and we have serious activities in Africa that I believe will yield outcomes for us and our industry. Also, despite the economic crisis, our sales in Europe have continued to rise.”</p><p>Varlik is optimistic that, given the wealth of options, Inoksan can localise in critical markets to attain a position like the one it has established in Turkey. He points out that foodservice consultants have a vital role to play in this, particularly for innovative companies such as Inoksan. “Consultants have become the driving force for the development of our industry. Their expectations and guidance in the design of our kitchens, the quality of the devices used and technical specifications encourage the whole industry to do better.”</p><p>In everything – the hard work he has already put in, enthusiasm about his industry and his positivity about the future – Varlik’s passion shines through. The end result is a serious player in global foodservice who captures his overarching outlook on life through the medium of his favourite pastime of all: tennis. “It’s a sport I can’t give up,” says Varlik. “The net across the court shows everyone their boundaries. You never know where the ball will go, so always have to be ready with a forehand and backhand. Service, on the other hand, represents ‘all in good time’ to me – everything is effective when used at the right time and in the right order. Then you have volleys and slices – moves representing the importance of specific skills.”</p><p>One thing is for sure: as far as innovative and ambitious foodservice goes, it’s game, set and match to Inoksan and Vehbi Varlik.</p>\n<div class=\"object-right factbox\">\n<table bgcolor=\"#eeeeee\">\n<tr>\n    <td>\n    <div class=\"text\"><h3>Values in practice</h3><p>Vehbi Varlik is enthusiastic about the potential of company values to provide a basis for success when they strike a balance between ambition and responsibility.

She tells Michael Jones about her career","body":"<table class=\"default\" cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\">\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">  <p class=\"dropcap\">I didn’t have any goals when I was young; no princess goals or anything. I didn’t know what I wanted to be when I grew up. I still don’t know what I want to be when I grow up,” laughs Christine Guyott.</p><p>We meet in Orlando, Florida, during the NAFEM 2017 Show on the day she is due to be honoured with FER magazine’s prestigious Industry Service Award. Princess goals notwithstanding, Guyott, a hugely respected consultant in the healthcare sector in particular and a principal of Rippe Associates, has certainly made a lasting impression on the industry.</p><p>Guyott grew up in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Her first hospitality experience was when her parents owned a bar in the north of the state. “They didn’t have a lot of foodservice, but it was a fun place to grow up,” she says.</p><p>Having attended school in Minneapolis, the expectation for Guyott and her peers was “to move away and go to a good college.” She ended up in Pepperdine University in California. “In high school I took Spanish for five years, adding Japanese for the last two years. I really liked languages and I wanted to travel. I thought I was going to be an international business person,” she smiles.</p><h3>The easy science</h3><p>As a freshman, in order to receive grant money Guyott worked on campus in the housing department. “I had to register before everyone else in school, and somebody said: “Take Nutrition – it’s the easy science.” So I did and I fell in love with it. My professors were fabulous. It was a small programme; our classes were four or five people. It was a great learning experience,” she says.</p><p>One of the reasons Guyott believes she broke into consulting at the age of 27 was due to one of her college professors having a relationship with Clevenger Nutritional Services, the management advisory service (MAS) arm of Clevenger Associates in California. In her senior year at college Guyott went to work at Clevenger in their office on Ocean Avenue in Santa Monica. It was a formative experience Guyott describes as “the coolest thing.”</p><p>At the end of her studies the next step for Guyott was to become a registered dietician, which required an internship. “I applied to all the California internships, which were the hardest to get into. In my first year I didn’t get a match, so Clevenger had me stay on there for a year. So I worked with them pulling cut sheets, selecting equipment and writing specs. We had some fabulous projects. One of them was a design project for the University of California, designing nutritional lab kitchens. I was able to help pick out materials. It was a lot of fun.”</p><p>A year later Guyott was matched into the Mayo Clinic internship programme at St Mary’s campus in Rochester, Minnesota. “It was probably one of the best internships on offer. I even got a stipend, which is unheard of. I lived in the hospital for a year. It was amazing,” she says.</p><p>Call it fate, or pure luck, but Guyott had inadvertently stumbled across a foodservice sector that would ultimately prove to shape and inspire her more than any other. “My big passion is healthcare,” she says. “Mayo was a huge influence. You see all these incredible healing experiences and world-renowned doctors. It’s overwhelming and it just takes you in.”</p><p>Guyott soon found the healthcare sector appealed to her methodical way of working, but ultimately she found the day-to-day role of nutritional support dietician “too repetitive” to consider it as a career. “I got very frustrated. Every day was exactly the same. It wasn’t something I could have done long term,” she says.</p><h3>Customer focus</h3><p>Guyott sat her dietician’s registration exam, moving back to Minneapolis-St Paul and working for nine months at Women Infants and Children’s (WIC) Program, a community initiative distributing vouchers for underprivileged mothers. By now though, she was looking for a career position. She started working for the foodservice distributor Sysco Minnesota in a healthcare sales specialist job.</p><p>“The role just looked right up my alley,” she says. “We weren’t directly responsible for sales, but we got to help the sales people. A lot of them came from the restaurant industry, so they didn’t know how to speak the healthcare language. So we helped them.”</p><p>While Guyott had felt frustrated working on the clinical side of healthcare, on the commercial side she felt very much appreciated. “We would come up with menus, teach classes, do ‘in-services’ for their staff and teach them about food safety or portioning. Every day was different. It was challenging and interesting.”</p><p>Guyott admits she has been an introvert from a young age. “I was so shy when I was growing up that I couldn’t answer the phone. I couldn’t speak to people. This has improved, but even at the FCSI Symposium this week I wanted to ask a question, so I raised my hand and my heart just went crazy,” she laughs.</p><p>The Sysco role, however, proved to be pivotal in sparking an interest in how to communicate effectively with customers. “At Sysco it was about just talking to people. I wasn’t trying to sell them anything – I was just helping them. A lot of the time customers were in small nursing homes in the middle of North Dakota. They loved visitors and appreciated the help, so I think it’s what fostered my interest in wanting to work with customers. That’s the part of my job that I love today.”</p><p>In 1991 one of Guyott’s clients at Sysco told her the Minnesota-based consultancy Rippe Associates were hiring. “She said there was a lot of travel but that I might be interested in it. And so here I was, with Bob [Rippe, the firm’s founder] and Terry [Pellegrino FCSI, principal] in an interview and I’m back into a consulting firm. There was only one in my tri-state area. I just think it was what I was supposed to be. How odd that you have consulting experience at college, which is a one in a million shot, right? And then you end up working for 20-odd years for a consulting firm,” she says.</p><p>Guyott began working with Pellegrino on K-12, schools, university and corrections projects as an operations consultant. This role was a combination of design and MAS, she suggests. “We went to the meetings with the principal and would be the communication person with the foodservice directors. We’d be the prime communicator on meeting records and would write specifications and meet with all the manufacturers to hear about their equipment. I enjoyed it straightaway,” she says.</p><p>“I can’t remember the first two years, it was just overwhelming,” she says. “I was on a couple of projects with Bob from a healthcare standpoint and after several years he would introduce me as the COO of the healthcare team. So I began working with Bob and then pretty much solely on healthcare after that, which felt comfortable to me.”</p><h3>The best of health</h3><p>Rippe instilled confidence in Guyott, which she thrived on. “He did nothing but support me and tell people how useful I was. I think it helped a lot when it came to the transition of his retirement. People were already thinking of me as Bob’s right hand person,” she says.</p><p>Pellegrino, meanwhile proved to be a mentor in another significant way, taking the time to teach Guyott how to draw project designs. “It was on Terry’s team that I would draw schools. Because schools are straightforward, laying those out was a good starting point. She was just really gracious. She didn’t tell you it sucked,” she laughs.</p><p>Allying the methodical, problem-solving element of project management work, which Guyott feels “fits that side of my dietician brain” with the creative aspect of design provides “a perfect blend” in her career, she says: “It takes a long time to learn how to be a consultant. And it’s hard to be the expert in the room until you have the experience behind you. I started when I was 28, I just listened and tried to observe as much as I could. I was scared to death because there was no formal training, so I worked and worked.”</p><p>Approximately 80% of Guyott’s work is now healthcare oriented, from a long-standing project with Stanford Hospitals and Clinics to smaller North Pine critical access hospital in Minnesota. The rest of her work is mainly K-12 projects. Under Guyott’s management, Rippe Associates are working on 30 or so projects at any one time. “All different levels – some are design, some are feasibility studies. Some are in construction administration, which doesn’t take as much of my time,” she says.</p><h3>Talent and passion</h3><p>Guyott believes one of the biggest challenges the industry faces is developing its talent pools, both on the operator and the design side. As someone who helped reinvigorate FCSI’s Council for Emerging Consultants (formerly ICON) Committee, which attracts and mentors younger consultants, she believes passionately that FCSI has an important role to play in this regard for the future of the profession.“I think it elevates us as professionals. When you have a professional organisation that holds its members to standards, it makes everybody else rise up,” she says.</p><p>“Our biggest competitors are dealers, and what do we have to offer that a dealer doesn’t? We are fee based and we aren’t selling equipment, so it can be a tough sell,” she continues. “When somebody can get design drawings for free versus paying, you have to educate. I often find myself saying to architects: ‘Would you want your client to hire the furniture salesperson to lay out your building? No. Do you want the equipment sales guy to lay out the kitchen? No’.”</p><p>Guyott’s passion for seeking constant improvement in the industry she loves remains undimmed – a princess goal if ever there was one. “My dad always says, ‘people don’t care about how much you know unless they know how much you care’,” she smiles.</p>\n  </td><td valign=\"top\">  <blockquote class=\"right\" ><span class=\"hide\">\"</span><p>“He [Bob Rippe] did nothing but support me and tell people how useful I was.

Starbucks, notably, has huge expansion plans, reports Jamie Fullerton","body":"<table class=\"default\" cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\">\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">  <p class=\"dropcap\">This is a place for taking photos and showing off,” says Xiao Xue, 30, sipping a Starbucks coffee in a branch of the US mega-chain in central Beijing.</p><p>“I think that when Starbucks first entered China they meant to mould the brand into one for proper office workers,” she continues, as a group of young girls sitting around a nearby table giggle and fiddle with their smartphones. “But somehow it’s become a place for young people taking selfies.”</p><p>Starbucks currently has around 2,500 outlets in China – that’s a lot of selfies with mugs of Americano being taken each day. The flood is set to intensify, with the firm announcing last November that it will double the number of venues it has in the country within the next five years, as part of its global plan to open 12,000 further stores in total. The company is expecting a 10% hike in global profit as a result of all the new openings.</p><p>“This is the early chapter of our China growth right now,” Belinda Wong, chief executive of Starbucks’ operations in China, told the South China Morning Post. “We have barely even scratched the surface. There is plenty of space to fill in first and second-tier cities where we have already opened – Beijing, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Shanghai.”</p><p>The Hong Kong-based newspaper called the aggressive expansion plan a “big bet” in China, which is traditionally the land of tea rather than hazelnut lattes. But the steady rise of Starbucks’ popularity in the country since launching there in 1999 suggests that the move is hardly a gamble.</p><p>“In China everything moves fast – it’s difficult for some western companies to understand how quickly and decisively things happen,” says Benji Lamb of the Shanghai-based Gentlemen Marketing Agency. “The scale of investment might seem crazy, but it’s common practice here.”</p><h3>Branding and promotion</h3><p>Indeed, Starbucks’ recent Chinese expansion – it opened 500 new stores in the country in 2015 – has already made China the firm’s top market outside the US. Rivals such as British chain Costa Coffee have followed suit – Costa plans to open 900 more stores in China, bringing its total to around 1,400 by 2020.</p><p>The rise in demand can partly be explained by the rapid modernisation of business culture in China’s largest cities over the past decade. “With urbanisation, the faster pace of life has made coffee more important in consumers’ lives,” says Summer Chen, an analyst at Mintel who wrote the market research company’s recent China coffee industry report. “Tea, on the other hand, is mostly consumed for nourishing, relaxation, or thirst-quenching. We found that the top reason for Chinese consumers to drink coffee was to boost energy.”</p><p>The dominating factor that has made Starbucks such a strong market leader in the coffee shop sector (in 2013, even before its expansion got hyper-aggressive, Euromonitor International said it had a 31.5% share), though, is its marketing strategy, including its branding of the coffee itself and its promotion on social media.</p><p>In the US Starbucks is presented as solid, fun, one-on-every-corner, drink-one-a-day coffee for people within a relatively wide income range. In China it is marketed as a premium product, retailing at prices around 20% higher than those in the US.</p><h3>Place to show off</h3><p>A three-storey Starbucks venue in Sanlitun Village, one of Beijing’s most fashionable and high-end shopping areas, is almost always jam-packed during opening hours.</p><p>“It’s a place for people who have a bit of extra money to spend,” says a 28-year-old banker who gives her name as Katyusha as she enjoys her drink. “It’s a place to show off publicly.”</p><p>“It’s seen as upmarket, even though in reality it’s not – the beans aren’t better [than those used in the US],” says Lamb. “It’s just a case of pricing and branding. People go to Starbucks because of the ‘face’ of it, because of the brand.”</p><p>There does indeed seem to be feverish Chinese appetite for Starbucks as a brand, beyond the contents of their big “Beijing” mugs that have pictures of the Great Wall of China on them. It’s common to see customers buying piles of Starbucks tat at the Beijing branches – keyrings seem particularly popular – and knockoff versions abound. Many shops in the capital stock cheap mugs bearing blurry versions of the iconic green logo.</p><p>“It’s considered a luxury product,” says Fangting Sun, a team leader at Euromonitor International who analyses the Chinese coffee chain industry. “The younger generations here love to follow the trends in the luxury industry. Starbucks got popular [early after its 1999 launch in China], then with rising disposable incomes a habit was cultivated.”</p><p>Starbucks’ social media-led marketing has been central to this habit-building. Beyond the endless Starbucks selfies being shared on WeChat, China’s enormously popular messaging app, the company recently launched a gifting service on the app that allows users to pay for a drink for a friend, who can redeem it in store.</p><p>Starbucks also now accepts payment for normal transactions through WeChat and has launched quirky functions such as one that suggests a style of drink to buy, sent along with a song, when a user tells Starbucks what mood they are in via an app. The latter is a measure that could turn off many cynical consumers in the West, but has only bolstered Starbucks’ brand power in China.</p><h3>Premium and desirable</h3><p>“The concept of marketing is newer here,” says Lamb. “There’s no actual direct translation to Chinese from English of the word ‘marketing’. Things such as the WeChat mood function would come across as gimmicky in the West but here, as a tailored, personalised thing, it was really effective. The Chinese weren’t sceptical about it.”</p><p>Similarly, in the West Starbucks, for all its success, is often seen as the ultimate symbol of capitalism – the company’s name almost a buzzword for soulless corporate America. In China this kind of backlash just hasn’t happened.</p><p>Here, although a rise in the number of boutique coffee shops suggests there is also an increasing taste for less mainstream palates, the middle classes overwhelmingly seem to regard capitalism as something positive and aspirational.</p><p>It comes as little surprise then that Starbucks is set to hit overdrive on its premium branding efforts by launching a series of ‘roasteries’. These are higher-end branches designed to be trendy meeting places, a bit more swish than its standard coffee shops.</p><p>Wong has described the forthcoming Shanghai branch, which promises an “immersive, all-sensory experience” as a “second Disneyland in Shanghai. It’s going to attract not only people in Shanghai, but also a lot of tourists in China.”</p><p>This all makes sense to Chen, as does Starbucks’ general plan to double up the number of outlets in China within five years. Although Wong has mentioned tier-one and two cities as Starbucks’ likely main targets, the potential beyond the biggest urban hubs is enormous.</p><h3>Craving cool stuff</h3><p>“China’s coffee house market is far from saturated,” says Chen. In a report on the industry released last December, her firm Mintel found that 35% of coffee consumers in tier two and three cities in China were heavy users of coffee houses, compared to 53% for tier one cities such as Beijing and Shanghai.</p><p>“This gap shows great room for expansion in the use of coffee houses in lower tier cities,” says Chen. “In fact, consumers from lower-tier cities crave trendy coffee house brands. They’ve been informed of new cool stuff happening in the bigger cities and are eager to experience it for themselves. In August 2016, when Starbucks opened its first store in Deyang, a tier-three city, consumers lined up from 6am.”</p><p>Starbucks’ China expansion, and that of the coffee house market it leads, is looking less like a bet and more like a chocolate chip cookie slam dunk.  </p>\n  </td><td valign=\"top\">  <blockquote class=\"right\" ><span class=\"hide\">\"</span><p>“With urbanisation, the faster pace of life has made coffee more important in consumers’ lives”</p><span class=\"hide\">\"</span></blockquote>\n\n  </td>\n</tr>\n\n</table>\n","layout":{"landscape":{"id":"am-dp1-layout13","link":"story-landscape-layout6.html"},"portrait":{"id":"am-dp1-layout14","link":"story-portrait-layout6.html"}},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":"","link_source":"","image":[{"id":"36fb8c3cfaa0ab48d1041affe2406a90","name":"Briefing_coffee","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://fcsi-live.audiencemedia.com/var/fcsi/storage/images/media2/images/briefing_coffee/45738-1-eng-GB/briefing_coffee_story_img_size_768x0.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"768","height":"707","is_default":true},{"id":"36fb8c3cfaa0ab48d1041affe2406a90","name":"Briefing_coffee","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://fcsi-live.audiencemedia.com/var/fcsi/storage/images/media2/images/briefing_coffee/45738-1-eng-GB/briefing_coffee_story_img_size_1024x0.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"1024","height":"943","is_default":false}],"url_alias":"http://fcsi-live.audiencemedia.com","type":"story","order":"10","folio_number":"","folio_numbers":"","pdf_page_index":"0","thumbnail":"http://fcsi-live.audiencemedia.com/var/fcsi/storage/images/media2/images/briefing_coffee/45738-1-eng-GB/briefing_coffee_tablet_story_thumbnail.jpg","color":"6894BC","real_id":"6328","main_section_id":"761","ads":[]},{"id":"9a17be0c0eadedfa9353dee02aa8a408","title":"Sophisticated simplicity","sub_title":"","author":[{"id":"0","name":"Tina Paw","email":"tina.paw@progressivecp.com","is_default":false}],"tag":"","strap_line":"Innovation: warewashing","intro":"Operators want a warewasher to be reliable and easy to use, but they also want to take advantage of advances in technology","body":"<p class=\"dropcap\">Noma, a four-time winner of the world’s best restaurant, recently made headlines again when it made its long-serving kitchen porter Ali Sonko a partner and co-owner at Noma. The move was a timely reminder that warewashing is an integral part of any commercial kitchen.</p><p>The ideal warewashing machine is highly cost-effective, simple to operate and durable enough to last for many years. In short, it should be installed and forgotten so that operators can focus on value-added elements of their business. The key drivers of the technology – efficiency, simplicity of operation, reliability and ease of cleaning and maintenance – do not change over time. The technology, however, is constantly evolving.</p><p>“End users want cost-efficiency above all else. Hospitals and hotels are driving the need for innovation in that area and sometimes manufacturers seem to struggle with it. Clients also want to minimise the amount of labour involved in warewashing, so they want simple and more cost-effective equipment. Simplicity is important because usually it is the newest member of staff that is given a Cadillac of a machine to operate,” remarks consultant Ed Bernard FCSI, vice president of consultancy Cini-Little International.</p><p>“Other functional areas get more priority but warewashing is important because you can’t have soiled dishes. As consultants we have to drive forward the message about not only efficiency, but also food safety,” he adds.</p><p>Equipment manufacturers recognise the need to add novel technologies to address the changing needs of end users, with energy efficiency being very much at the top of the agenda.</p><p>“There is a continual evolution of the equipment but on one hand operators want a tool that is reliable, simple and durable. On the other hand we are seeing a desire in the US for lower water consumption, especially on the coasts but even in places like Florida. It is driven by both a focus on sustainability and a need to consider resource availability in places where there might be a drought. Energy costs are a focus, too, which is why our machines have been designed to save thousands of gallons of water each year and our proprietary drainwater recovery system is helping to save energy by reducing the need to heat water,” says Tim Peters, product manager at Hobart Corporation (ITW).</p><p>“People want the equipment to work, so they can forget it until it is time to swap it out after many years. That is why we focus not only on innovative features such as the drainwater system, but also on the quality of our components and the quality of manufacturing to make our machines more robust and durable,” he adds.</p><p> </p><h3><b>Savings through smart thinking</b></h3><p>As well as Hobart, other manufacturers are leading the way in innovation. Meiko, for example, makes machines for small kitchens that start at 2ft (60cm) in length and go up to 98ft (30 metres) for large-scale catering facilities. It has built a reputation as an innovative solution provider over the last 90 years.</p><p>“The conditions customers present to us have become very specific and differ from case to case. By listening carefully to them, foodservice consultants and dealers, we are offering solutions that fit their individual requirements. In 2009, we launched the M-iQ series and, so far, our competitors have not been able to match it. M-iQ is a platform concept that encompasses a range of conveyer widths and heights to provide optimal use of space. We have improved cleaning power by 30% and cut running costs by around 30% too,” notes Meiko Group CEO Stefan Scheringer.</p><p>“In the past, nobody really cared about water or energy consumption. For the German market, we began to alter the technical details of our machines as early as 1972 with a clear goal of reducing running costs and minimising the use of precious resources. In the last couple of years we have seen a change of mind in many countries concerning the saving of water, energy and detergents, but we also see another trend: user-friendliness.”</p><p>Meiko’s innovations include an intelligent booster heater to raise water temperature quickly so that plates in the first few washes are properly sanitised. The M-iQ range has GreenEye technology that divides a washer’s rack into lanes so that sanitising rinse water only goes to those lanes on which there are plates. The M-iClean undercounter glasswasher has an illuminated handle with a simple colour code: blue when idle, green when in operation and red when there is an issue that needs to be checked, plus an illuminated interior to reduce the risk of breakages in dark bar areas.</p><p>“Cost efficiency is a high priority. A big issue facing customers in the US is one that our friends in Europe have dealt with for longer – that is higher utility rates,” explains Mike Pavlovic, senior systems planner at Meiko in the US.</p><p>“A few years ago a rack conveyor dishwasher would use around 300 gallons of water per hour, now that has come down to below 100 gallons. Water may be cheap, but it needs to be heated for the final rinse, and then kept at a stable temperature for use as wash water – all of which consumes energy. Detergent and rinse agent are also added. If you use less water, then you pay less for all other utilities. Nevertheless, you do reach a point where you can’t reduce the amount of water needed to sanitise plates, so then you have to look at other things such as recycling heat to save energy. You can use exhaust air or drain water as a source of heat, and if you can keep the water cleaner using filtration systems then you save on detergent,” says Pavlovic.</p><h3>Pure and simple</h3><p>Winterhalter is another manufacturer that has devised a new approach to warewashing through listening carefully to its customers. It launched its Next Level Solutions in November 2016, which comprises Connected Wash and Pay Per Wash. In an increasingly networked world, Connected Wash integrates the new generation of the UC series into a network to enable the analysis and evaluation of operating data to optimise the cleaning process.</p><p>“We connect our undercounter machines to the Internet of Things so that an operator can monitor what a machine – or a number of machines – is doing at any point in time,” says Paul Crowley, marketing development manager at Winterhalter. “We have invested a lot in making our machines more intelligent. They record the consumption levels of water, energy and chemicals. This information can be shared so an engineer can look at a machine’s history if there is a fault, so it can be diagnosed quicker. Through WiFi we can pull the data into a portal so the operator can see it live in real time. So far, we are the only warewashing company to use that technology.”</p><p>This software-driven functionality, which allows transparency of the entire fleet of warewashers an operator owns and opens up the possibility of preventative maintenance, will be rolled out to other Winterhalter equipment this year.</p><p>“Now that they can see the data, operators can also get a view of costs in real time. It is the kind of factual data on which they can base business decisions,” Crowley adds. “Intelligent equipment is a familiar concept for many customers, but only now is it becoming a reality. With Pay Per Wash we are providing the first warewasher you only pay for when you actually use it. This has taken off among smaller operators since it came onto the market in January. Customers get a premium product without the large initial outlay and they can predict the cost each month.”</p><p>Simplicity is also the key driver for UK-based manufacturer Classeq Glass And Dishwashing Systems Ltd, which is owned by Winterhalter.</p><p>“Where we sit in the mid-market segment innovation is a constant theme, but it is not necessarily about new technology,” says Classeq sales director Nick Burridge. “The range we launched in January is the result of 18 months of research into what customers and distributors want and it is not necessarily new features, but instead warewashing made simple. That is why we have made it easier for customers when they are choosing new equipment. We are trying to make everything more user-friendly.</p><p>The new Classeq range has replaced the old electromechanical system with a flat-screen digital interface to provide a simple but intuitive control panel to access new features. “Users can now adjust the water softener to suit the hardness of the water, adjust the chemical dose, test individual components and see more data on usage,” adds Burridge. “This makes it easier for the engineer to service and easier for the end user to obtain valuable information from the machine. We are just bringing existing technology to our target market.”</p><p>The future will see the same themes define the trajectory of product development. Modular systems that adapt to the needs of individual operators may come to the fore. The key, however, will be the continued close relationship between manufacturers and customers to ensure all innovation meets a specific business need.</p><table class=\"default\" cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\">\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">  &nbsp;\n  </td><td valign=\"top\">  <p> </p>\n  </td>\n</tr>\n\n</table>\n","layout":{"landscape":{"id":"am-dp1-layout7","link":"story-landscape-layout4.html"},"portrait":{"id":"am-dp1-layout8","link":"story-portrait-layout4.html"}},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":"","link_source":"","image":[{"id":"f7e033cc6a0130e69698b26ee5617fed","name":"Innovation_warewahsing_main","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://fcsi-live.audiencemedia.com/var/fcsi/storage/images/media2/images/innovation_warewahsing_main5/45964-1-eng-GB/innovation_warewahsing_main_story_img_size_768x0.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"768","height":"707","is_default":true},{"id":"f7e033cc6a0130e69698b26ee5617fed","name":"Innovation_warewahsing_main","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://fcsi-live.audiencemedia.com/var/fcsi/storage/images/media2/images/innovation_warewahsing_main5/45964-1-eng-GB/innovation_warewahsing_main_story_img_size_1024x0.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"1024","height":"943","is_default":false}],"url_alias":"http://fcsi-live.audiencemedia.com","type":"story","order":"11","folio_number":"","folio_numbers":"","pdf_page_index":"0","thumbnail":"http://fcsi-live.audiencemedia.com/var/fcsi/storage/images/media2/images/innovation_warewahsing_main5/45964-1-eng-GB/innovation_warewahsing_main_tablet_story_thumbnail.jpg","color":"6894BC","real_id":"6330","main_section_id":"761","ads":[]}],"type":null,"ads":[]}}
