Liz Campbell takes a look at the food scene in this tiny city-state","body":"<table class=\"default\" cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\">\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">  <p class=\"dropcap\">Watching Chan Hon Meng clean a nearby table, I can’t help but wonder how many Michelin-starred chefs bus tables in their restaurants. But despite having achieved a distinction coveted by chefs worldwide, this diminutive man, fondly known as Hawker Chan, is clearing up. His was one of the first two Michelin stars ever awarded to hawkers, Singapore’s name for food stalls. The tables are in his newly opened second location, but it hasn’t eased the legendary line-ups for his Liao Fan Hong Kong Soya Sauce Chicken Rice and Noodle – his version of Hainanese barbecued chicken served on rice or noodles. </p><p>In more than 40 years of food writing, rarely have meals in Michelin Guide restaurants come my way. But here in Singapore, I had four opportunities over the course of just one week. And Hawker Chan’s cost less than US$3.</p><p>This tiny city-state has always been all about food. While Singaporeans will happily shell out $75 for a meal in one of the city’s star-studded restaurants, they also regularly patronise the more than 6,000 hawkers found all over the city, many gathered in one of the many “hawker centres” such as Lau Pa Sat (see main picture), which includes an outdoor night market with flaming barbecue stations. Here, for just a few dollars, one can feast handsomely from a host of different, mainly Asian cuisines.</p><h3>Peranakan influence</h3><p>Malay and Chinese have been the strongest influences on both customs and food. Indeed, a historic blend of these has created a unique Singapore culture, Peranakan, which is enjoying a new zenith these days. The decor of the new Indigo Hotel (IHG Hotels), located in the Peranakan neighbourhood of Joo Chiat, features this culture’s distinctive pastel colours and vibrant tiles throughout. Housed within the former Joo Chiat police station at the front of the hotel, Indigo’s restaurant, Baba Chews, also serves traditional Peranakan dishes.</p><p>Indeed, restaurants are springing up all over Singapore, serving Peranakan delicacies such as rendang (a slow-simmered spicy beef or chicken dish), kueh (small cakes and sweets often made with coconut and palm sugar), and laksa (a spicy coconut soup with noodles, fish and meat which reputedly takes many hours to prepare, and for which the recipes are generally closely guarded family secrets).</p><p>“I grew up eating rice, curries and sambals (chili sauces). But as a chef, I started cooking French cuisine,” says chef Malcolm Lee of Candlenut, the first Michelin starred Peranakan restaurant. “It didn’t feel right, here in my heart. I don’t feel any connection to coq au vin. I felt something was out of balance.”</p><p>Over the past seven years Candlenut (named for a local nut used in Peranakan cuisine) has evolved from elegant, plated dishes to what Lee calls the “essence of Peranakan food”.</p><p>“I returned to the rustic recipes of my grandmother, he explains. “Traditionally, we fry spices with lots of oil. Candlenut’s versions are refined to give you the mouth feel, but not so much fat.” His rendang is made with lean Wagyu beef flavoured with serundeng (spicy, fried, grated coconut) and turmeric leaf.</p><h3>Passion for food</h3><p>It’s probably not surprising that restaurants such as Baba Chews and Candlenut are thriving. When it comes to dining two distinct threads define the restaurant scene in this tiny country. The first is the Singaporean love of their historical roots and pride in the food that has evolved from these. So Peranakan cuisine, using authentic, local ingredients, is on the up. In fact, 328 Katong Laksa, a corner eatery that specialises in its eponymous soup, was awarded a Bib Gourmand by Michelin. But this is balanced against a second thread. Singaporeans are adventurous diners, interested in other cuisines and in experimenting with new foods. This has seen the opening of restaurants serving what has been dubbed Mod Sin (modern Singaporean) by its creator, Willin Low.</p><p>Lawyer turned chef, Low is the brains behind the definitive Mod Sin restaurant, Wild Rocket, and several sister eateries – Relish, Wild Oats and most recently, Po. He explains that his food grew out of his homesickness while studying law in England. He would cook the foods of home, using ingredients he could find and improvising when necessary. The result was a hit with friends who urged him to don a chef’s hat. After seven years practicing law, he did.</p><p>“Singaporeans are so passionate about food. At first we were terrified people would say: ‘What have you done with Singapore food?’” laughs Low. His creations are undoubtedly unique. For example, one of his early dishes still on the menu is pasta tossed with a pesto made from candlenuts and laksa leaf. (This local herb, which is often called Vietnamese mint in Europe, is usually used only in laksa here.) Instead of cheese, he tops the dish with dried shrimp, another traditional ingredient. On his newest menu, laksa leaf provides the flavour for a salad served with savoury ice cream dressing (pictured below right).</p><p>But don’t call Mod Sin a fusion cuisine. “Fusion is confusion,” Low says, emphasising the first syllable. “You just have to remember that food is not limited by geography today. I like to borrow ingredients from everywhere.”</p><p>Nonetheless, he insists, his food is true to its roots, “In this age of globalisation, I think it’s important to celebrate why your country is unique. If everyone wants to make cupcakes, then no one will remember how to make the kueh that my grandmother used to make.” On the menu at Wild Rocket you’ll find banana kueh in a typically Willin Low pairing with pineapple sorbet and salted caramel.</p><p>This chef might have found a perfect formula for piquing the interest of a place that the Michelin Guide has dubbed “the dining capital of Asia”. After all, chefs from around the world have come to Singapore to flex their culinary biceps including superstars like Daniel Boulud, Gordon Ramsay, Wolfgang Puck, Mario Batali, Jamie Oliver, Luke Mangan and more.</p><p>Beyond Asian, stellar chefs are serving European cuisines in Singapore’s finest hotels. UK chef Kirk Westaway serves fine French cuisine at Jaan at The Stamford (Swissôtel). At Brasserie Les Saveurs, the signature restaurant of The St. Regis Singapore, Canadian chef Thomas Cruise creates contemporary European fare. The Fullerton’s Lighthouse restaurant, overlooking the marina, specialises in dishes from Campania, Sardinia and Sicily prepared by chef Carlo Marengoni. And superstar chef, Joël Robuchon just added five more stars to his collection for his two restaurants at Resorts World Sentosa.</p><h3>Time for tea</h3><p>At Raffles Grill (pictured above), the oldest Western restaurant in Singapore, located in its oldest hotel, chef Pierre Burgade offers diners French cuisine with a modern twist. His special degustation menu is a masterpiece of small plates, each perfectly crafted in a marriage of colour and flavour. Burgade has to please discriminating palates. For more than 100 years, Raffles Hotel has played host to the world’s glitterati and most of its royalty. During British colonial times, this was the place to go for a Singapore Sling at the Long Bar, for an elegant dinner or for afternoon tea.</p><p>Faithful to British tradition, you’ll still find a complete afternoon tea served in the Tiffin Room at Raffles. Indeed, this decadent indulgence is served all over Singapore. You’ll even find a charming afternoon tea at Marks &amp; Spencer’s café on Orchard Street in the heart of the chic shopping district.</p><p>Whether one chooses fine restaurants or hawkers, the government’s food inspection programme ensures that the food meets high standards. Everyone serving food displays an inspection card with their rating from A to D. Both A and B are acceptable. In fact, we enjoyed an outstanding plate of Hong Kong Noodles (called Singapore Noodles everywhere else in the world) at a B-graded no-name hawker for $3. Could Singapore break even more new ground with Michelin? Could a no-name eatery earn Michelin honours? </p>\n  </td><td valign=\"top\">  \n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                    \n\n                                <img src=\"/var/fcsi/storage/images/media2/images/briefing_singapore3/45752-1-eng-GB/briefing_singapore3_web250.jpg\" width=\"250\"  alt=\"Briefing_Singapore3\" title=\"Briefing_Singapore3\" />\n                                    \n    \n    \n    </div>\n  </td>\n</tr>\n\n</table>\n","layout":{"landscape":{"id":"am-dp1-layout3c","link":"story-landscape-layout2c.html"},"portrait":{"id":"am-dp1-layout4c","link":"story-portrait-layout2c.html"}},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":"","link_source":"","image":[{"id":"e8a6c4f8b81127ec109377a250806332","name":"transparant","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://fcsi-live.audiencemedia.com/var/fcsi/storage/images/media2/images/transparant57/43377-1-eng-GB/transparant_story_img_size_107x0.png","portrait":true,"width":"243","height":"107","is_default":true},{"id":"e8a6c4f8b81127ec109377a250806332","name":"transparant","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://fcsi-live.audiencemedia.com/var/fcsi/storage/images/media2/images/transparant57/43377-1-eng-GB/transparant_story_img_size_197x0.png","portrait":false,"width":"447","height":"197","is_default":false}],"related_objects":{"image":[{"id":"8f10620109583b3adf1dbb7753fd95c1","name":"Briefing_Singapore3","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://fcsi-live.audiencemedia.com/var/fcsi/storage/images/media2/images/briefing_singapore3/45752-1-eng-GB/briefing_singapore3_web250.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"250","height":"230"},{"id":"8f10620109583b3adf1dbb7753fd95c1","name":"Briefing_Singapore3","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://fcsi-live.audiencemedia.com/var/fcsi/storage/images/media2/images/briefing_singapore3/45752-1-eng-GB/briefing_singapore3_web250.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"250","height":"230"}]},"url_alias":"http://fcsi-live.audiencemedia.com","type":"story","order":"12","folio_number":"","folio_numbers":"","pdf_page_index":"0","thumbnail":"http://fcsi-live.audiencemedia.com/var/fcsi/storage/images/media2/images/transparant57/43377-1-eng-GB/transparant_tablet_story_thumbnail.png","color":"B12B46","real_id":"6334","main_section_id":"762","ads":[]},{"id":"027ceb088f29f1831e32668d091d09ae","title":"The Asian health kick","sub_title":"","author":[{"id":"0","name":"Tina Paw","email":"tina.paw@progressivecp.com","is_default":false}],"tag":"","strap_line":"Healthy eating","intro":"All across Asia people are embracing healthy eating habits, turning to low-fat, low-sugar, plant-based and organic options.

It aired Kung Fu Fighter, Hidden Sugar, a 90-second video on the evils of sugar in New Year goodies. Just two days after it was posted on the gov.sg’s Facebook page it had garnered one million views and over 17,000 shares.</p><p>The festive season of Chinese New Year is known for heavy consumption of sweets such as pineapple tarts and bakwa (salty-sweet dried meat). This educational campaign is part of the Singapore government’s war on diabetes, which affects 440,000 Singaporeans.</p><p>In the US, kale and avocado on toast have become iconic foods for a growing population committed to healthy eating. Clean eating, Paleo, low sugar, low carb, vegan and gluten free are just a few of the buzzwords among the Western health community. While these words may not roll easily off their tongues, more Asians are also making healthier food choices.</p><p> </p><h3><b>Growing awareness</b></h3><p>Healthy eating in Asia is no longer a niche market limited to high-earning, gym-going urban professionals in Hong Kong and Singapore. “It started with this group, but it is now expanding and growing,” says Clara Ming Pi FCSI. The rise in diabetes and obesity is a real concern now in Asia. This was the focus of Pi’s plenary presentation at last year’s joint conference in Kuala Lumpur for the Malaysian Dietetics’ Association (MDA) and American Overseas Dietetic Association (AODA). She believes more countries will benefit from educational campaigns like the initiative from the Singapore government, positively affecting the health of people as well as the planet.</p><p>Restaurants and food manufacturers in Asia have started focusing on creating healthier food options. In 2013, Euromonitor Research observed how Asia leads as the fastest-growing market for health and wellness packaged goods and beverages, namely in China, Indonesia, Vietnam, Thailand, and India. Nielsen’s 2014 global report on snacking attributes the growing worldwide demand for healthy food partly to factors like rising affluence in developing countries. The 2015 Euromarket International cites China and India among the fastest growing market for biscuits and snack bars, including breakfast muesli and granola bars.</p><p>In China, organic food is gaining interest among the rising middle class, without interventions from the government. More Chinese families are seeing the benefit of investing a portion of their increasing incomes on better food choices rather than luxury goods.</p><p> </p><h3><b>Changing traditions</b></h3><p>Mintel observed a 17% increase in food and drink launches with functional claims in Southeast Asia between 2011 and 2014, indicating importance of health and wellness in making food choices. Seeing the growth potential in high nutrition in Asia, trend forecaster Stefan Hajkowicz is pushing New Zealand to increase exports to the region. In China where many are wary of tainted food products, New Zealand already has a great reputation for dairy products. It won’t be a stretch expanding to other healthy food products.</p><p>In Singapore, McDonald’s launched a vegetarian burger made of green peas, carrots, green beans, red peppers and potatoes last August, making it a permanent item on their menu. One QSR concept quickly growing in the region is Salad Stop! It began in Singapore in 2009 as a revolutionary movement towards health and wellbeing. Today, it prides itself on being the first and largest healthy food chain in Asia operating in Singapore, Manila, Jakarta and Tokyo. Catering to the local palate, the salads are inspired by flavours such as Oh Crab Lah! – a nod to Singapore’s chili crab – and Jai Ho! – with free-range tandoori chicken and Indian spices. With a freshness commitment of 72 hours from earth to bowl, ingredients are sourced from local partners.</p><p>“Whether people are going vegan for animal welfare, health or environmental reasons there’s no doubt there’s a surge in vegan foods popping up in restaurants all over Asia,” says Jason Barker, vice president of PETA Asia. “Our recently released list of the top 10 vegan-friendly cities in Asia proves there is a huge demand for plant-based foods across the continent and businesses are catching on. From vegan isaw (chicken intestines) at Greenery Kitchen in Manila to all-vegan bakeries such as Veganerie in Bangkok and Vegan Heaven in Taipei, businesses are finding new, cruelty-free, healthy ways to re-create traditional favourites without using meat or dairy products.” Barker reports large crowds at all-vegan festivals in Hong Kong, Taipei, Bali, Bangkok, Ho Chi Minh City, Singapore, Tokyo, and the Philippines. There’s even an all-vegan supermarket in Taiwan, as well as a meat-free supermarket in Hong Kong.</p><p> </p><h3><b>Local options</b></h3><p>Although Asians are gradually becoming more mindful of cruelty to animals, Barker believes many shift to a plant-based diet for health reasons. “Plant foods contain no cholesterol, whereas meat, eggs and dairy products contain large amounts of cholesterol and saturated fat,” he explains. “Approximately 90% of Asians are lactose-intolerant, meaning that their bodies cannot break down the sugar in milk, which can result in symptoms such as acne, cramps, bloating and diarrhoea.”</p><p>There are many ways for manufacturers and restaurants to cater to Asia’s growing health food market. Pi sees an opportunity in producing and delivering healthy food to schools, office buildings and facilities. In Hong Kong, this has already taken off. The healthy food delivery scene is a growing business with at least 15 companies creating and delivering customised meal plans for professionals.</p><p>As more Asians embrace a healthier diet, they need not consume imported kale from the US or quinoa from South America. Pi emphasises the importance of using local healthy ingredients, “It’s not only cheaper and fresher, but reduces the carbon footprint of food.”  </p>\n  </td>\n</tr>\n\n</table>\n","layout":{"landscape":{"id":"am-dp1-layout3b","link":"story-landscape-layout2b.html"},"portrait":{"id":"am-dp1-layout4b","link":"story-portrait-layout2b.html"}},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":"","link_source":"","image":[{"id":"b628f64c4cea0a4a9bc9262babd39cc0","name":"transparant","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://fcsi-live.audiencemedia.com/var/fcsi/storage/images/media2/images/transparant58/43414-1-eng-GB/transparant_story_img_size_107x0.png","portrait":true,"width":"243","height":"107","is_default":true},{"id":"b628f64c4cea0a4a9bc9262babd39cc0","name":"transparant","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://fcsi-live.audiencemedia.com/var/fcsi/storage/images/media2/images/transparant58/43414-1-eng-GB/transparant_story_img_size_197x0.png","portrait":false,"width":"447","height":"197","is_default":false}],"related_objects":{"image":[{"id":"048a703699963eb1ff3be43516dc2b00","name":"Briefing_Healthy2","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://fcsi-live.audiencemedia.com/var/fcsi/storage/images/media2/images/briefing_healthy2/45766-1-eng-GB/briefing_healthy2_web720.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"720","height":"663"},{"id":"048a703699963eb1ff3be43516dc2b00","name":"Briefing_Healthy2","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://fcsi-live.audiencemedia.com/var/fcsi/storage/images/media2/images/briefing_healthy2/45766-1-eng-GB/briefing_healthy2_web720.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"720","height":"663"}]},"url_alias":"http://fcsi-live.audiencemedia.com","type":"story","order":"13","folio_number":"","folio_numbers":"","pdf_page_index":"0","thumbnail":"http://fcsi-live.audiencemedia.com/var/fcsi/storage/images/media2/images/transparant58/43414-1-eng-GB/transparant_tablet_story_thumbnail.png","color":"B12B46","real_id":"6336","main_section_id":"762","ads":[]},{"id":"26e941640bc626ab71caca7dca7c31f3","title":"LUCY JONES","sub_title":"Two minutes with…","author":[{"id":"0","name":"Tina Paw","email":"tina.paw@progressivecp.com","is_default":false}],"tag":"","strap_line":"Last bite","intro":"The British dietician and TV presenter speaks to Tina Nielsen about a balanced diet and offering customers healthy choices\r\n","body":"<table class=\"default\" cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\">\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">  <aside class=\" author\">\n\t\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                    \n\n                                <img src=\"/var/fcsi/storage/images/media2/images/last_bite2/45759-1-eng-GB/last_bite_web720.jpg\" width=\"720\"  alt=\"LAST_BITE\" title=\"LAST_BITE\" />\n                                    \n    \n    \n    </div>\n</aside>\n  </td><td valign=\"top\">  <h3><b>What is good food?</b></h3><p>There is no good food, only a good diet. I believe that almost every food can be part of a healthy balanced diet. Often society wants to label things as good or bad, clean or unclean, healthy or unhealthy. The truth is we can consume most foods in a healthy way if we get them in the right balance and proportions. So I want to push the fact that there are good diets rather than good food.</p><p> </p><h3>You must have seen a huge change in people’s attitude to healthy food?</h3><p>If I think back to 10 years ago I’d go to events where a company such as Alpro would be promoting plant-based eating, but I’d be thinking, “this is not going to take off”. A decade later we have come so far. I think the adoption of healthy habits by celebrities and the people the younger generation follow, combined with social media, has been a massive factor.</p><p> </p><h3>What are the drivers behind this change?</h3><p>The amount of media attention that nutrition gets is interesting. We are so interested in food and we all have to eat. You can choose whether to go out, smoke or drink, but you can’t choose whether to eat. So people have a vested interest in food and nutrition and that drives the media interest in any new research and reports that come out. People have more interest but they are also confused because they hear conflicting reports all the time.</p><p> </p><h3>What role do operators have in helping people make the right choices?</h3><p>So much of people’s diet is consumed in the fast casual sector when they are out and about. It has an influence on the nutrition you get; how much fat you have eaten, how much fiber you get. Chefs and the menu designers have a huge influence on what people eat and I think it is important they make sure they support our health.</p><p> </p><h3>Does the industry have a responsibility to give people these healthy offerings?</h3><p>Responsibility is one of those questions in the media: should it be a regulatory issue, is the health of the nation the industry’s responsibility because they are serving the food or is it our personal responsibility? The reality is our collective national health is the responsibility of all of us. It is up to the individual to make sure they are educated and they are choosing healthy options, but they can’t make those choices unless healthy options are on offer.</p><p> </p><h3>What makes an ideal menu?</h3><p>It’s not too long, it has enough variety to suit all parties, it has choices so people can either have more indulgent options or they can take a more healthy, balanced option. Finally it needs to be at the right price. </p>\n  </td>\n</tr>\n\n</table>\n","layout":{"landscape":{"id":"am-dp1-layout3b","link":"story-landscape-layout2b.html"},"portrait":{"id":"am-dp1-layout4b","link":"story-portrait-layout2b.html"}},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":"","link_source":"","image":[{"id":"143f9a1f47a9c1859ebe04757a3f34c9","name":"transparant","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://fcsi-live.audiencemedia.com/var/fcsi/storage/images/media2/images/transparant56/42731-1-eng-GB/transparant_story_img_size_107x0.png","portrait":true,"width":"243","height":"107","is_default":true},{"id":"143f9a1f47a9c1859ebe04757a3f34c9","name":"transparant","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://fcsi-live.audiencemedia.com/var/fcsi/storage/images/media2/images/transparant56/42731-1-eng-GB/transparant_story_img_size_197x0.png","portrait":false,"width":"447","height":"197","is_default":false}],"related_objects":{"image":[{"id":"5c2ea114e107c863cf2f9f38e8d62e99","name":"LAST_BITE","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://fcsi-live.audiencemedia.com/var/fcsi/storage/images/media2/images/last_bite2/45759-1-eng-GB/last_bite_web720.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"720","height":"663"},{"id":"5c2ea114e107c863cf2f9f38e8d62e99","name":"LAST_BITE","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://fcsi-live.audiencemedia.com/var/fcsi/storage/images/media2/images/last_bite2/45759-1-eng-GB/last_bite_web720.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"720","height":"663"}]},"url_alias":"http://fcsi-live.audiencemedia.com","type":"story","order":"14","folio_number":"","folio_numbers":"","pdf_page_index":"0","thumbnail":"http://fcsi-live.audiencemedia.com/var/fcsi/storage/images/media2/images/transparant56/42731-1-eng-GB/transparant_tablet_story_thumbnail.png","color":"B12B46","real_id":"6338","main_section_id":"762","ads":[]}],"type":null,"ads":[]}}
