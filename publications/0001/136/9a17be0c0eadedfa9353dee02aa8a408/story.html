<p class="dropcap">Noma, a four-time winner of the world’s best restaurant, recently made headlines again when it made its long-serving kitchen porter Ali Sonko a partner and co-owner at Noma. The move was a timely reminder that warewashing is an integral part of any commercial kitchen.</p><p>The ideal warewashing machine is highly cost-effective, simple to operate and durable enough to last for many years. In short, it should be installed and forgotten so that operators can focus on value-added elements of their business. The key drivers of the technology – efficiency, simplicity of operation, reliability and ease of cleaning and maintenance – do not change over time. The technology, however, is constantly evolving.</p><p>“End users want cost-efficiency above all else. Hospitals and hotels are driving the need for innovation in that area and sometimes manufacturers seem to struggle with it. Clients also want to minimise the amount of labour involved in warewashing, so they want simple and more cost-effective equipment. Simplicity is important because usually it is the newest member of staff that is given a Cadillac of a machine to operate,” remarks consultant Ed Bernard FCSI, vice president of consultancy Cini-Little International.</p><p>“Other functional areas get more priority but warewashing is important because you can’t have soiled dishes. As consultants we have to drive forward the message about not only efficiency, but also food safety,” he adds.</p><p>Equipment manufacturers recognise the need to add novel technologies to address the changing needs of end users, with energy efficiency being very much at the top of the agenda.</p><p>“There is a continual evolution of the equipment but on one hand operators want a tool that is reliable, simple and durable. On the other hand we are seeing a desire in the US for lower water consumption, especially on the coasts but even in places like Florida. It is driven by both a focus on sustainability and a need to consider resource availability in places where there might be a drought. Energy costs are a focus, too, which is why our machines have been designed to save thousands of gallons of water each year and our proprietary drainwater recovery system is helping to save energy by reducing the need to heat water,” says Tim Peters, product manager at Hobart Corporation (ITW).</p><p>“People want the equipment to work, so they can forget it until it is time to swap it out after many years. That is why we focus not only on innovative features such as the drainwater system, but also on the quality of our components and the quality of manufacturing to make our machines more robust and durable,” he adds.</p><p> </p><h3><b>Savings through smart thinking</b></h3><p>As well as Hobart, other manufacturers are leading the way in innovation. Meiko, for example, makes machines for small kitchens that start at 2ft (60cm) in length and go up to 98ft (30 metres) for large-scale catering facilities. It has built a reputation as an innovative solution provider over the last 90 years.</p><p>“The conditions customers present to us have become very specific and differ from case to case. By listening carefully to them, foodservice consultants and dealers, we are offering solutions that fit their individual requirements. In 2009, we launched the M-iQ series and, so far, our competitors have not been able to match it. M-iQ is a platform concept that encompasses a range of conveyer widths and heights to provide optimal use of space. We have improved cleaning power by 30% and cut running costs by around 30% too,” notes Meiko Group CEO Stefan Scheringer.</p><p>“In the past, nobody really cared about water or energy consumption. For the German market, we began to alter the technical details of our machines as early as 1972 with a clear goal of reducing running costs and minimising the use of precious resources. In the last couple of years we have seen a change of mind in many countries concerning the saving of water, energy and detergents, but we also see another trend: user-friendliness.”</p><p>Meiko’s innovations include an intelligent booster heater to raise water temperature quickly so that plates in the first few washes are properly sanitised. The M-iQ range has GreenEye technology that divides a washer’s rack into lanes so that sanitising rinse water only goes to those lanes on which there are plates. The M-iClean undercounter glasswasher has an illuminated handle with a simple colour code: blue when idle, green when in operation and red when there is an issue that needs to be checked, plus an illuminated interior to reduce the risk of breakages in dark bar areas.</p><p>“Cost efficiency is a high priority. A big issue facing customers in the US is one that our friends in Europe have dealt with for longer – that is higher utility rates,” explains Mike Pavlovic, senior systems planner at Meiko in the US.</p><p>“A few years ago a rack conveyor dishwasher would use around 300 gallons of water per hour, now that has come down to below 100 gallons. Water may be cheap, but it needs to be heated for the final rinse, and then kept at a stable temperature for use as wash water – all of which consumes energy. Detergent and rinse agent are also added. If you use less water, then you pay less for all other utilities. Nevertheless, you do reach a point where you can’t reduce the amount of water needed to sanitise plates, so then you have to look at other things such as recycling heat to save energy. You can use exhaust air or drain water as a source of heat, and if you can keep the water cleaner using filtration systems then you save on detergent,” says Pavlovic.</p><h3>Pure and simple</h3><p>Winterhalter is another manufacturer that has devised a new approach to warewashing through listening carefully to its customers. It launched its Next Level Solutions in November 2016, which comprises Connected Wash and Pay Per Wash. In an increasingly networked world, Connected Wash integrates the new generation of the UC series into a network to enable the analysis and evaluation of operating data to optimise the cleaning process.</p><p>“We connect our undercounter machines to the Internet of Things so that an operator can monitor what a machine – or a number of machines – is doing at any point in time,” says Paul Crowley, marketing development manager at Winterhalter. “We have invested a lot in making our machines more intelligent. They record the consumption levels of water, energy and chemicals. This information can be shared so an engineer can look at a machine’s history if there is a fault, so it can be diagnosed quicker. Through WiFi we can pull the data into a portal so the operator can see it live in real time. So far, we are the only warewashing company to use that technology.”</p><p>This software-driven functionality, which allows transparency of the entire fleet of warewashers an operator owns and opens up the possibility of preventative maintenance, will be rolled out to other Winterhalter equipment this year.</p><p>“Now that they can see the data, operators can also get a view of costs in real time. It is the kind of factual data on which they can base business decisions,” Crowley adds. “Intelligent equipment is a familiar concept for many customers, but only now is it becoming a reality. With Pay Per Wash we are providing the first warewasher you only pay for when you actually use it. This has taken off among smaller operators since it came onto the market in January. Customers get a premium product without the large initial outlay and they can predict the cost each month.”</p><p>Simplicity is also the key driver for UK-based manufacturer Classeq Glass And Dishwashing Systems Ltd, which is owned by Winterhalter.</p><p>“Where we sit in the mid-market segment innovation is a constant theme, but it is not necessarily about new technology,” says Classeq sales director Nick Burridge. “The range we launched in January is the result of 18 months of research into what customers and distributors want and it is not necessarily new features, but instead warewashing made simple. That is why we have made it easier for customers when they are choosing new equipment. We are trying to make everything more user-friendly.</p><p>The new Classeq range has replaced the old electromechanical system with a flat-screen digital interface to provide a simple but intuitive control panel to access new features. “Users can now adjust the water softener to suit the hardness of the water, adjust the chemical dose, test individual components and see more data on usage,” adds Burridge. “This makes it easier for the engineer to service and easier for the end user to obtain valuable information from the machine. We are just bringing existing technology to our target market.”</p><p>The future will see the same themes define the trajectory of product development. Modular systems that adapt to the needs of individual operators may come to the fore. The key, however, will be the continued close relationship between manufacturers and customers to ensure all innovation meets a specific business need.</p><table class="default" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
