  </td><td valign="top">  <h3>What projects are you currently working on?</h3><p>I am responsible for business development for Cini-Little so I am involved in the pursuit of all the project opportunities at our firm. Some of the projects we’re working on include: the Wilshire Grand Center, Los Angeles; Comcast Technology Center, Philadelphia; Yale University Residential Colleges, New Haven; Centre Hospitalier de L’Université de Montréal, Canada; various Four Seasons Hotels; Subaru of America in Camden; and various theme parks worldwide.</p><p> </p><h3>What kind of work do you specialize in?</h3><p>I lead the firm’s marketing efforts, overseeing a team of three marketing professionals and championing client development for the firm’s 15 worldwide offices. I work with our project managers to develop strategic marketing programs, strengthen name recognition and win pursuits to keep our project pipeline active and full.</p><p> </p><h3>What do you enjoy most about your profession?</h3><p>I like working with people and using the power of networking to create opportunities and solve problems. I use various social media platforms to differentiate Cini-Little from the competition. I also enjoy seeing the full life cycle of an opportunity – from the pursuit to the win to the design and finally to the project’s opening. But it doesn’t stop there. The next step is sharing the project’s story with others in the industry and elsewhere.</p><p> </p><h3>What does being an FCSI member mean to you?</h3><p>Through my involvement on the BUILT and now the marketing committee, I hope to be able to educate members on marketing best practices. I have also taken part in two recent FCSI speaking engagements talking about marketing aspects of the business.</p><p> </p><h3>What do you think are the biggest challenges FCSI members are facing?</h3><p>Technology in the industry is ever changing by leaps and bounds and our members need to stay ahead of the curve in order to provide our clients with the most up-to-date information and the best design for their needs. This is important as foodservice consulting is not a licensed profession. FCSI acts as the accreditation for our field, ensuring that standards are met by its members. </p><p> </p><h3>What are your goals for this year?</h3><p>I would like to see more Cini-Little staff go through professional certification so they can become productive members of FCSI as well as the best consultants they can be. My goal for our staff is to continually educate themselves – through mentoring, sharing ideas, participating in association membership programs and heading up committees where you learn from other professionals both in our industry and the ones we serve.</p><p> </p><h3>What achievements in your career/life are you proudest of?</h3><p>I am proud that I am a VP and officer of Cini-Little. I have been a part of the Cini-Little family for 24 years, helping to build the company into a leader in the industry while keeping the core values that have kept us in business for the past 60 years. Our company has transitioned from the four founding owners to a new management group that includes Dick Eisenbarth FCSI, Orlando Espinosa, Diane Dowling and me. I am also a proud mom to four wonderful, mischievous boys; while at the same time a full-time staff member of Cini-Little.</p><p> </p><h3>What are your interests away from the office?</h3><p>I enjoy spending time with my husband and sons. My mantra is never take a day for granted. Life is way too short</p><h3> </h3>
