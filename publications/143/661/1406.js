The result: the World Fame 100. X So what did we learn? That the world—the <i>entire</i> world, not just our neck of it—makes fame go around. Just ask an MLB or NHL player, none of whom made the cut, or Chinese table tennis player Ma Long, who did (No. 71). Or ask any of the 38 soccer players, who outnumbered all U.S. athletes on the list. Love the NFL? The world scoffs. Not only does top NFLer Tom Brady rank a mere 21st, there are more Brazilians here than football players. X Oh, and the last thing we learned: If you’re single-name famous (like Ronaldo, Federer or Serena), you’re probably so famous that we wrote a whole story on you too.

It is late summer 2016 at Valdebebas, Real Madrid’s state-of-the-art HQ northeast of Spain’s capital, and it is hot outside. In the foreground, dominating the skyline, stand the four skyscrapers constructed a decade ago on the site of Madrid’s old training ground. Easily the tallest buildings in the country, they are nicknamed for the original <i>galácticos</i>, the most glamorous collection of footballers ever brought together in a single side: Luis Figo, Ronaldo Nazario, David Beckham and Zidane.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_143/storage/images/media2/images/espnus170612_article_036_01_02/4520510-1-eng-US/espnus170612_article_036_01_022.jpg\" width=\"1400\" height=\"929\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"espnus170612_article_036_01_02\" title=\"espnus170612_article_036_01_02\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>With 369 goals, Ronaldo is the all-time leading scorer across the top five European leagues.</b></p>\n <span class=\"credit\">\nPOWER SPORT IMAGES/GETTY IMAGES</span></figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>All of them played for Madrid in the 2000s; now one of them, unexpectedly, is coach. Zidane: World Cup winner, European champion, Champions League winner with Real Madrid and holder of the Ballon d’Or, the coveted prize for the world’s best player. One of the all-time greats.</p>\n<p>In January 2016, Zidane had taken over a team of malcontent superstars with a conservative style of play and a disappointing third-place standing in La Liga. Five months later, Zidane’s squad won the Champions League. Now, as he looks out over the skyline on this August day, Zidane has two obvious goals: repeat in the Champions League and reclaim the La Liga crown from Leo Messi’s Barcelona. But first he has to do the completely unexpected by changing the way this generation’s greatest galáctico, Cristiano Ronaldo, approaches the game.</p>\n<p>In a few days, Ronaldo will miss the season’s start, recovering from a knee injury sustained just minutes into the Euro 2016 final. At 31, he has seemingly reached the pinnacle of an astonishing career—international success. Yet, facing his footballing mortality, his best season had also been one of his worst. He has much to celebrate, European champion for club and country, but also issues to address. His future, especially. Whether he has much of one.</p>\n<p>Zidane seeks him out. <i>If you listen to me,</i> the coach says softly, <i>you’ll reach the end of the season in better shape than ever before—and you’ll prolong your career.</i></p>\n<p>Ronaldo listens.</p>\n<p><b>WHEN ZIDANE TALKS,</b> people pay attention. Maybe it’s precisely because he doesn’t say much. That’s his personality, although get him alone and he is surprisingly engaging. His status as one of the true greats of the modern game doesn’t hurt either. Very, very few people have played at the level of Madrid’s players, can talk to them as equals. Zidane can.</p>\n<p>Real Madrid is not just Ronaldo; this is an absurdly talented squad, every player an international, six of them appearing in our World Fame 100. Men who needn’t take many orders; men with few superiors. Why should Ronaldo, or any of them, listen?</p>\n<p>Because Zidane is one of them. He is not their superior but their equal. Zidane’s last words before every game are “enjoy it.” Before last season’s Champions League final, when everyone was talking about the pressure and the tension, Zidane said: “I wish I could play.”</p>\n<p>Some of Madrid’s players sarcastically referred to Rafa Benitez, their previous coach, as El Diez (the No. 10, the team’s best player). He was a renowned coach, but he had never played, and for some of them—proud, protective, sensitive—that matters.</p>\n<p>With Zidane, they got a real No. 10. Benitez tried to tell Ronaldo, a Ballon d’Or winner over a decade into his career, how to strike a ball, which way to stand when he took free kicks. All Ronaldo gave in return was coldness, bemusement, a touch of resentment. Zidane took free kicks with him instead, a training ground challenge. Twenty yards from goal, a line of balls, an inflatable defensive wall, a goalkeeper there to stop them. Zidane won.</p>\n<p>His success as a leader wasn’t a given. Plenty of former greats have tried managing, with varied results. “No one could see him being a coach, none of us,” former Madrid defender Alvaro Arbeloa says. “And now look at him.” During one lunch before he got the job, Madrid’s president debated with his CEO about whose responsibility it would be to sack Zidane when the time came, as they were sure it would.</p>\n<p>The media said he was too introverted, too inexperienced, not a tactical genius like Pep Guardiola or a defensive mastermind like Diego Simeone. Even after he orchestrated Madrid’s stunning turnaround in his first season, they said he just got lucky. It’s easy to win when you have the best players in the world.</p>\n<p><b>IN MAY 2016,</b> a few weeks before Ronaldo scored the decisive penalty to win Real Madrid’s record 11th Champions League title, Zidane was asked whether he would like his star to rest more. Ronaldo had been chasing a record that season, trying to play every single minute. It was damaging, but it drove him. “Yes,” Zidane said softly. He didn’t say anything else; he didn’t need to.</p>\n<p>Zidane prepared a training regimen for Ronaldo, then spoke to him. The Portuguese star had reached the end of the previous three or four seasons exhausted. Zidane pointed this out. He told him that rest was vital, not just to reach the end of the season in better shape but to reach the season after it and the season after that. He told Ronaldo to forget the Pichichi award for top scorer—an obsession he’d won three times in six seasons—to worry less about the number of goals, more about <i>which</i> goals.</p>\n<p>Some players have to be persuaded to do more; Ronaldo has to be persuaded to do less. One member of the coaching staff recalls “a game where we came back at 3 in the morning and he went down and had an ice bath. When we came back from Istanbul at 6 a.m., there’s the physio giving him a rubdown.” Zidane saw the work; he wanted to rationalize it. He appealed to Ronaldo’s desire to make history. <i>It is because you matter, because we need you</i>, he told him, <i>that I want you to not play sometimes. It’s good for you.</i></p>\n<p>Did Ronaldo want another European final in which his influence was minimal? Of course not, but it is a dangerous discourse. Telling a player to take a step back is not an easy path; when Ronaldo was taken off in Las Palmas earlier this season, he was unhappy. “He has to rest sometime,” Zidane said publicly, echoing what he had told Ronaldo privately months before.</p>\n<p>Zidane spoke; Ronaldo listened. He offered the advice with affection, empathy and experience. He had felt his own faculties diminish over the final years of his career, the fatigue eat at his mind and muscles. Seeing that, he had rested and prepared to be the best player at the 2006 World Cup, at age 34. Now he was passing that down.</p>\n<p>“I have made a radical change this year,” Ronaldo says. “In the last four, five seasons, I have always got to the end pushing the limits; this year I have prepared for these final couple of months.”</p>\n<p>So they agreed—a pact, not an imposition. Four times in six weeks this spring Ronaldo was left out away from home. Left out entirely, not just made a sub. If he sits on the bench, he doesn’t like it, Zidane’s technical staff concluded. He will be tense, anxious, his mood still dictated by the game, the center of his day. Better that he doesn’t go at all: no plane, no hotel, no team talks, no stress, no stadium, a total break. And then on Monday, he races his way through training.</p>\n<p>Zidane remembers; he hated hotels. “I couldn’t take it anymore. All day locked in your room up to a game … <i>oof!</i> In the end, it tired me out. Football is wonderful and I’m not complaining, but it’s hard. So I went. You miss the adrenaline of playing. You’ll always miss that but not the rest of it. You tire of it.”</p>\n<p>Ronaldo saw that Zidane understood. As time went by, everything he had been told came true. In the summer, Zidane asked him to give up some of what had made him who he was, to choose quality over quantity, to defer gratification, to resist that relentless pursuit of goals and records for something more meaningful. It will be worth it, Zidane said, to reach the season’s climax in his best shape. And because his manager got it, Ronaldo got it too. Between them, they delivered on a promise.</p>\n<p>In the spring, Ronaldo scored eight goals in four games to take Real Madrid to the Champions League final, against Juventus on June 3 in Cardiff, Wales. Zidane and Ronaldo are just 90 minutes from making Real Madrid the first club to successfully defend the Champions League trophy.</p>\n<p>A historic achievement, even among galácticos.</p>\n","layout":{"landscape":{"id":"am-rs-landscape-3","link":"feature_02-l.twig"},"portrait":{"id":"am-rs-portrait-3","link":"feature_02.twig"}},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":1,"link_source":"","image":[{"id":"zinio_espnus170612_article_036_01_image_0_1496159832.8534","name":"espnus170612_article_036_01_01","source":"ILLUSTRATION PHOTO REFERENCE VI IMAGES/GETTY IMAGES FROM LEFT: ALBERTO SAIZ/AP PHOTO;","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_143/storage/images/media2/images/espnus170612_article_036_01_01/4520517-1-eng-US/espnus170612_article_036_01_012.jpg?t=story_img_size_768x0&ext/espnus170612_article_036_01_012_story_img_size_768x0.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"2140","height":"1799","legacy_id":"883073","is_default":true},{"id":"zinio_espnus170612_article_036_01_image_0_1496159832.8534","name":"espnus170612_article_036_01_01","source":"ILLUSTRATION PHOTO REFERENCE VI IMAGES/GETTY IMAGES FROM LEFT: ALBERTO SAIZ/AP PHOTO;","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_143/storage/images/media2/images/espnus170612_article_036_01_01/4520517-1-eng-US/espnus170612_article_036_01_012.jpg?t=story_img_size_768x0&ext/espnus170612_article_036_01_012_story_img_size_768x0.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"2140","height":"1799","legacy_id":"883073","is_default":false}],"related_objects":{"image":[{"id":"zinio_espnus170612_article_036_01_image_1_1496159832.2383","name":"espnus170612_article_036_01_02","source":"POWER SPORT IMAGES/GETTY IMAGES","caption":"<p><b>With 369 goals, Ronaldo is the all-time leading scorer across the top five European leagues.</b></p>\n","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_143/storage/images/media2/images/espnus170612_article_036_01_02/4520510-1-eng-US/espnus170612_article_036_01_022.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"1400","height":"929","legacy_id":"883072"},{"id":"zinio_espnus170612_article_036_01_image_1_1496159832.2383","name":"espnus170612_article_036_01_02","source":"POWER SPORT IMAGES/GETTY IMAGES","caption":"<p><b>With 369 goals, Ronaldo is the all-time leading scorer across the top five European leagues.</b></p>\n","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_143/storage/images/media2/images/espnus170612_article_036_01_02/4520510-1-eng-US/espnus170612_article_036_01_022.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"1400","height":"929","legacy_id":"883072"}]},"url_alias":"http://espnthemagazine-us.audiencemedia.com","type":"story","order":"7","folio_number":"36","folio_numbers":"36,37,38,39,40","pdf_page_index":"36","thumbnail":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_143/storage/images/media2/images/espnus170612_article_036_01_01/4520517-1-eng-US/espnus170612_article_036_01_012.jpg?t=tablet_story_thumbnail&ext/espnus170612_article_036_01_012_tablet_story_thumbnail.jpg","color":"ef3e36","real_id":"883071","main_section_id":"1406","ads":[]},{"id":"zinio_661_espnus170612_article_039_01_1496159834.2871","title":"3: LIONEL MESSI","sub_title":"","author":[{"id":"0","name":"—IAN CHADBAND","email":"noreply@audiencemedia.com","is_default":false}],"tag":"","strap_line":"","intro":"","body":"<p class=\"byline\"><b>—IAN CHADBAND</b></p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_143/storage/images/media2/images/espnus170612_article_039_01_01/4520562-1-eng-US/espnus170612_article_039_01_012.jpg\" width=\"552\" height=\"450\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"espnus170612_article_039_01_01\" title=\"espnus170612_article_039_01_01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n <span class=\"credit\">\nILLUSTRATION PHOTO REFERENCE: NARIMAN EL-MOFTY/AP PHOTO</span></figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div>\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_143/storage/images/media2/images/espnus170612_article_039_01_03/4520548-1-eng-US/espnus170612_article_039_01_032.jpg\" width=\"293\" height=\"137\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"espnus170612_article_039_01_03\" title=\"espnus170612_article_039_01_03\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"pullQuote\"><b>“WHAT HE DOES TOUCHES THE IMPOSSIBLE.

FEDERER</b></p>\n<p><b>COUNTRY SWITZERLAND</b></p>\n<p><b>SPORT TENNIS</b></p>\n<p><b>ENDORSEMENTS $60M</b></p>\n<p><b>FACEBOOK FOLLOWERS 14.2M</b></p>\n<p><b>TWITTER FOLLOWERS 6.7M</b></p>\n<p>He was down 3-1 in the fifth set of the 2017 Australian Open final, losing to Rafael Nadal, his career kryptonite. Nadal, who was 6–0 against Federer in grand slams since 2008, pounded forehands at him. Federer felt his legs go heavy. Then heavier. He started talking to himself. “I recall saying, ‘You have to try to break now, pal, because later on he is going to stay in the lead and have the break, and then too much luck is involved to turn the whole thing around.’”</p>\n<p>More than any player in the modern era, Roger Federer has made the game look easy. Federer, the graceful. Federer, the perfect. Federer, the ideal tennis player. It’s what makes him so intoxicating to watch. It’s what inspires a near literal traveling church of Roger Federer faithful at ATP events. But what looks easy comes with a soundtrack, an internal monologue, and in that monologue, the greatest male tennis player of all time will sometimes grind hard, full of doubt and pressure and frustration, wrestling with history and ambition, fearful of coming up short.</p>\n<p>“Oh, s---, he’s got me at the finish line,” Federer said to himself.</p>\n<p>He struggled to calm down. He kept talking, tried to stay positive: “I told myself, ‘I’ve done very little wrong. I’ve played committed. I’ve played bigger with my backhand than I ever have against Rafa. I’ve hit a lot of backhand winners.’”</p>\n<p>He was resetting, centering himself in the middle of a free fall. And somewhere in the conversation between Federer and Federer he found the calm he was seeking. This was an unlikely final to be in, coming off a left knee injury at age 35, and the boisterous crowd was with him. He fed on its energy. He remembers it now as some combination of Zen and excitement. “A different mindset,” he says. Instead of getting shaky, he got energized. Instead of reproducing an old pattern, he found something new. “I had the best 20 minutes of my life, maybe, on the tennis court,” he says. “I just zoned in and just went …” He lifts his right hand and mimics a jet taking off. It climbs higher and higher, and then it flies away.</p>\n<p>Federer is sitting at a long, lacquered table in a private dining room at the Four Seasons Hotel in downtown Seattle. He is tanned and wears a black Nike top and black Nike sweats. He sits up in his chair, unspooling the moment in Melbourne, excited at the memory of it. “What I was telling myself is ‘Play free,’” he says. “‘Don’t feel like you’re in a straitjacket. Feel like you have nothing to lose, maybe for one of the first times.’ ”</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_143/storage/images/media2/images/espnus170612_article_042_01_02/4520593-1-eng-US/espnus170612_article_042_01_022.jpg\" width=\"200\" height=\"508\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"espnus170612_article_042_01_02\" title=\"espnus170612_article_042_01_02\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div>\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_143/storage/images/media2/images/espnus170612_article_042_01_03/4520586-1-eng-US/espnus170612_article_042_01_032.jpg\" width=\"1472\" height=\"1793\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"espnus170612_article_042_01_03\" title=\"espnus170612_article_042_01_03\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>18 AND UP By winning the Australian Open this year, Roger Federer padded his lead over his two active rivals—Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic—on the career grand slam titles leaderboard.</b></p>\n <span class=\"credit\">\nGROOMING BY KAT SUMMERS; WARDROBE STYLING BY SAMANTHA FRANCIS; PROP STYLING BY HOLLY HARDY; PRODUCTION BY MERAKI</span></figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p class=\"pullQuote\"><b>“I’VE HAD ROCKY YEARS, AND I DID HAVE MY DOUBTS. BUT NOW I CAN JUST PLAY THE TOURNAMENTS I WANT AND ENJOY THE PROCESS.”</b></p>\n<p>With Federer serving for the match, Nadal made one last charge, earning two break points and threatening to take back momentum. Federer kept talking to himself, urging himself on: “Just keep not thinking too much about the what-ifs … the pressure, the moment. I know it’s huge, we all know it’s huge, but just try to shake it off. Don’t freeze up. Fight, but don’t try too hard and want it too much.”</p>\n<p>He looks out the hotel-room window toward Puget Sound. The sky is clear and blue. “Just like Switzerland,” he says. Snow-covered mountains rise in the distance. The view is scarred by an unsightly gray power plant. He looks past it to the water and the white peaks.</p>\n<p>“I let go,” he says.</p>\n<p><b>THE 20 MINUTES</b> in Melbourne have changed the tone and shape of the last phase of Roger Federer’s career.</p>\n<p>For as long as he keeps playing tennis, he says, he will seek the feeling he found on that night. He is closing in on two decades as a professional, a record career that includes 18 grand slams, but winning the Australian after a nearly five-year major tournament drought— and against a legion of critics who said his best days might be behind him—feels like a beginning somehow. Never mind making tennis look easy; he is learning how to play the game at ease.</p>\n<p>“I’m having a great time,” he says, pouring himself a Pellegrino. “A fantastic time, really.” He doesn’t mean just at Melbourne. He dominated at the BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells, California, in March, then won another big title in Miami in April. He beat Nadal in all three tournaments, twice without losing a set.</p>\n<p>The run seems to be helping him ignore expectations—and retirement chatter—as he picks and chooses the tournaments he plays while his younger rivals push through the ATP tour schedule. Thinking about saving energy, going easy on his surgically repaired left knee and extending his playing days as long as he can, Federer recently opted out of the upcoming French Open; clay courts often mean long, grinding matches, and the surface doesn’t favor Federer’s quick game.</p>\n<p>“I can just play the tournaments I want to play and enjoy the process,” he says. “If I do show up and play, I love it. When I’m in training, I enjoy being in training. When I’m not in training, if I’m on vacation, I can enjoy that. I’m not in a rush. So I can take a step back and just actually enjoy.”</p>\n<p><b>HE IS IN</b> Seattle because of Bill Gates. A Federer superfan and dedicated rec-level player, Gates watched his favorite player at Indian Wells. They bonded there over tennis and philanthropy. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has spent billions on improving living standards in Africa. Federer’s foundation also focuses on Africa, especially education for children. They decided to organize an exhibition at the KeyArena in Seattle—Federer vs. John Isner, the tall, big-serving American—as part of a fundraiser for Federer’s charity.</p>\n<p>A couple of days before the exhibition, Federer, wife Mirka and a few others from his team visited Gates’ 66,000-square-foot compound on the shores of Lake Washington, called Xanadu 2.0. Before courses of halibut and steak, they spoke about physics and Leonardo da Vinci and his audacious, open-minded genius. Growing up, Federer wasn’t focused on being a student, he says. He stopped going to school at age 16 to play tennis full time. Over the years, he’s tried to soak up knowledge where he can. The night at Gates’ estate was a career high point. “It was so inspiring,” he says. “It was surreal.”</p>\n<p>Gates invited his guests into his library. He and Federer paid special attention to a notebook in a glass case—the Codex Leicester, filled with Leonardo’s drawings, theories and thoughts. Gates paid $30.8 million for it in 1994.</p>\n<p>Federer stared in amazement. “He tells you that Da Vinci wrote upside down and from right to left—Leonardo da Vinci!—and he was not only great at one thing but he was also great at other things, and you realize how broad somebody’s mind can be. Bill Gates is one of those people too. You can feel it. He makes you—not because he wants to in any way, because he’s super humble—but he just makes you feel so small, in the sense that I know so little. Everything he says just seems really important, and you try to absorb it. I tried really to put my antennas up.”</p>\n<p>Over the course of a long weekend, Federer and Gates had two dinners and a lunch together. They practiced tennis in front of an exclusive audience of deep-pocket donors, and Federer presented Gates with a new racket similar to his own, a matte-black Wilson RF97. It was inscribed on the throat with Gates’ profile and renamed the BG97.</p>\n<p>Gates was struck by Federer’s curiosity, and, of course, by his grace. “You know, tennis, it’s sort of physics,” he says. “But it’s also artistic, particularly the way Roger appears to move so effortlessly.” Practicing with Federer, noticing his attention to detail, his meticulous approach, Gates was reminded of a software engineer’s painstaking efforts to make computer programs easy to use. “You’re making impossible things actually look fairly easy because you’ve done so much behind the scenes to understand it,” he says.</p>\n<p>At the exhibition, Federer and Gates played a lighthearted set of doubles with Isner and Pearl Jam guitarist Mike McCready. Gates was nervous about playing in front of a crowd. His reputation as a computer genius and philanthropist is unassailable, but what if he embarrassed himself as a tennis player? Federer took him aside. One of the world’s greatest tennis players became a coach. One of the world’s richest men became a student. The lessons were imported from Australia.</p>\n<p><i>Be aggressive but loose. Breathe deep. Keep a Zen-like focus on the ball.</i></p>\n<p>“Let go,” Federer said. “He made it clear,” Gates says, “that we were going to have fun.” Gates didn’t miss a single serve.</p>\n<p><b>ONCE A CAREFULLY</b> crafted image of Swiss perfection, Federer has long showed only glimpses of his life in carefully choreographed doses. But lately that’s been changing. “I have an easier time sharing these feelings that I have with people,” he says.</p>\n<p>He laughed through an impromptu recording of a karaoke moment in January with tour buddies Tommy Haas and Grigor Dimitrov. “We’re starting a boyband #NOTNSYNC,” said his Instagram account. The video went viral. He filmed a practice session in Dubai wearing a microphone, describing drills in real time and taking questions from fans. “I miss you guys,” he said. “That is why I am training so hard and trying to get back, so that we can sort of see each other again.”</p>\n<p>At Indian Wells, he held a news conference for elementary school kids and talked kittens and oatmeal and parents. Then he plopped to the floor and did pushups with laughing second-graders. In Miami, he posed for a selfie with a large iguana that trundled around the side courts. “Roger is feeling it,” says Haas, a longtime pro.</p>\n<p>At the Met Gala in New York in early May, Federer wore a tuxedo that looked very much like a Federer tuxedo: classic and well-trimmed. But when he turned around, there was a cobra on the back. A bejeweled, tongue-flashing cobra on Roger Federer. Wrap your mind around that. He snapped selfies. They flew across the internet. “I thought, ‘Come on, let’s come up with something cool,’” he says. “I’ve never been so, ‘Let me look good. Let’s do something fun here.’”</p>\n<p>Famously private and focused, he says he sometimes muses now about how cool it might be to show up at a public park, surprise people and shoot hoops with them or hit tennis balls. But so far he hasn’t been able to bring himself to do it. He’s still Swiss, after all. Showing up unannounced on someone else’s turf would be impolite. “I’m entering someone’s space, and I would disrupt somebody. … Going to the park and doing that and seeing people’s faces would be very cool. But I don’t know—I’m too shy to do it for now.”</p>\n<p><b>FEDERER IS SURPRISED</b> by how excited people have been about him since Australia. “I’ve had rocky years the last few years,” he says. “And I did have my doubts. I think people can relate to that.”</p>\n<p>Until now, he largely has been a blank slate upon which fans can project their feelings—like Gates, who sees in him some fantastic combination of science and art. But if perfection was once the draw for Fed fans, maybe now it’s something more human.</p>\n<p>Reality peaked in 2016, when he twisted a knee while bathing his children in Melbourne and tore his meniscus, requiring surgery. If a simple task of fatherhood caused a serious injury, how much longer could he expect to play tennis like Roger Federer? Then he hurt his back. Then, at Wimbledon, he fell in a heap against Milos Raonic in the semifinals. His knee newly aggravated, he took six months off the tour for rehab.</p>\n<p>For the first time since he was a teenager, he experienced what it was like to have significant time away from pressure and fame. He spent long stretches at home, near Zurich. He hung out at his second home in Dubai. He visited Greece and took his family to the Hamptons. “It felt like the end of a career,” he says. He missed the game but also learned that when the time comes to retire, he will be able to handle it. “When all is said and done,” he says, “it will be fine.”</p>\n<p>Knowing this has made it easier to get back into the game. He followed the tour during his rehab, tracking who was struggling and who was on a roll. On an indoor court in Switzerland, he began to hit balls again. The ritual was familiar, but it felt different too. He sensed that playing tennis offered a special kind of truth for him, a feeling of mastery and control and singular competition that he would never get anywhere else, a feeling he liked. Call it joy.</p>\n<p>“Oh, man,” he recalls thinking, “it would be nice to be back. It would be nice.”</p>\n<p><b>AS A TEENAGER,</b> Federer says he had “an amazing time—coming up, sharing the locker room with the guys for the first time.” Between ages 20 and 30, he broke through and dominated the men’s game like few before him. After 30, he was up and down until his injury. His play this season stands apart from the years when he was winning three grand slam tournaments a year. Back then, there were stretches when the expectations were absurd. “People were like, ‘Oh my god, he’s maybe going to lose a set in this match,’” he recalls. “And I’m thinking, like, ‘OK, guys, margins are slim. It is normal to lose sets. It might be normal to lose a match.’”</p>\n<p>Now neither Federer nor his fans are certain what to expect. He turns 36 in August. This was supposed to be the year of his steep decline. After Australia, Indian Wells and Miami, after getting a seeming upper hand on Nadal, what does he think about the future now? Wimbledon in July is his Holy Grail. He is practicing on hard, fast courts—with Wimbledon balls. After that, he plans a full schedule, highlighted by the U.S. Open and the tour finals. Maybe he’ll finish another season ranked No. 1.</p>\n<p>“I think if I find the right balance, it could be quite exciting,” he says. Exciting enough to stave off any notions of impending retirement, though he is coy about predictions. “I will play until 40,” he says, deadpan. Then he laughs. “Just maybe not on the tour.” His goal right now is “to keep a freshness, a freeness” in his game.</p>\n<p>It showed at Indian Wells. During practice on the olive and blue courts near the main stadium, the spectators sat 10 rows deep in the stands. He toyed with the ball, spinning it sideways, slapping it to all corners.

But now Kevin Durant feared it would be just another vantage point to sustain him through yet another injury.</p>\n<p>It had all been going so well too. Fifty-eight games into his maiden voyage with Golden State, he’d been averaging a tidy 25.8 points and 8.4 rebounds, shooting a career-high 53.8 percent. It was Feb. 28, a date he’d circled on his calendar—the night he would return to his native Washington, D.C., for the first time in his gleaming gold and blue duds, to play in front of nearly 80 family and friends.</p>\n<p>Just 57 seconds into the game, Wizards forward Markieff Morris lured Klay Thompson into the post as Durant watched from the weak side. Morris’ turnaround jumper bounced off the iron, and Wizards center Marcin Gortat threw Zaza Pachulia out of the way in pursuit—Pachulia flailing backward, his 275-pound body rolling into Durant’s left leg. It buckled awkwardly. When Durant grabbed his knee and hopped three steps up the court, his father, Wayne Pratt, turned to his wife: “Kevin’s hurt.”</p>\n<p>“I knew,” Pratt says now, “because he never reaches for his leg like that.”</p>\n<p>Durant stayed in the game for 36 more seconds, jogging gingerly up the court before retreating to the bench. “Something’s not right,” he told coach Steve Kerr. On the sideline, Wizards coach Scott Brooks couldn’t help but wince. He’d come to adore KD during the seven years they were together in OKC, back when basketball was the only thing that mattered to Durant. “I would say, ‘Kevin, did you eat breakfast today?’ Or, ‘Kevin, you need to wash your face.’ ‘Kevin, you need a haircut.’ He had no clue. He just wanted to play ball.”</p>\n<p>As Durant limped off the court, his mother, Wanda, was arriving at her seat. She’d been stuck at the turnstile, head-counting the gaggle of relatives attending the game. Before she could sit, Durant’s brother Tony cut in. “Mom,” he said, “it’s Kevin.”</p>\n<p>Wanda hurried to the visitors locker room, warding off the rising panic in her chest. It was all too familiar—eerily reminiscent of what she’d felt two years earlier after her son’s last serious injury, when Durant had broken his foot. When she found Kevin now, he was being attended to by Chelsea Lane, Warriors head of physical performance and sports medicine. Durant’s business partner Rich Kleiman was there too. The initial X-rays were negative, but Durant was clearly in pain. “I’ll come with you to the hospital,” Wanda assured her son.</p>\n<p>“No, Mom,” Durant said. “I got this.”</p>\n<p>Kleiman accompanied Durant on the 2.7-mile drive to MedStar Washington Hospital Center, where his father once worked police detail. There, the orderlies, nurses and security guards still remembered him as a gangly 13-year-old running the halls. But when they greeted him now, Durant didn’t respond. “I was in a daze,” he says.</p>\n<p>Although preliminary MRI results revealed a “significant injury,” Kleiman was advised not to tell Durant anything until a CT scan could confirm the diagnosis. But Durant was more than a client to Kleimanhe talks to him eight to 10 times a day. There would be no secrets. “You have a broken tibia,” he told Durant. It was an injury that would end his season.</p>\n<p>Durant blinked back tears. Soon he was sobbing, his head in his hands. “It was such a freak injury,” Durant says now. “I’m flashing back to OKC, where I had all those problems with my feet, and I’m asking, <i>Again? Why again?”</i></p>\n<p>Kleiman called Wanda. She too wept at the news. Durant reached out to Draymond Green via text. “Fractured tibia,” he typed into his phone. “Done for the year.” Green responded immediately: “Are you serious??”</p>\n<p><i>All those months of rehab on my foot, all that angst over choosing my own path, and this is what I get?</i> Durant’s mind was racing. He remembered the isolation and uncertainty of his last injury. But then, suddenly, Durant’s mood turned.</p>\n<p>He lifted his head. He wiped his face. He straightened and told Kleiman, “C’mon. Let’s get out of here.”</p>\n<p><b>KEVIN DURANT WAS</b> just 18 when the Seattle SuperSonics drafted him with the No. 2 pick in 2007. Anxious to establish roots in his new city, he bought a house he hoped to call home for the next decade. Instead, the franchise relocated to Oklahoma City after one season. Durant wouldn’t sell that Seattle house for almost six years.</p>\n<p>If there was a lesson to be learned from that, Durant wasn’t ready for it. What he was ready for was basketball. He immersed himself in a young OKC nucleus that included Russell Westbrook, Serge Ibaka and James Harden—the four of them often staying at the facility well after practice, eyeballing one another in a game of workout chicken. <i>Who’s going to stop first? Who’s going to leave first?</i> Not Kevin. Never Kevin.</p>\n<p>“I was in a different place then,” Durant says. “I was in a basketball bubble where nothing else mattered to me.”</p>\n<p>It all came so fast. Yet it all took so long. After winning just 23 games in 2008-09, the Thunder surged to 50 wins the next season, the Western Conference finals by 2011, the NBA Finals by 2012, followed by Durant’s first MVP award in 2014. But then Harden was traded, and bodies began breaking. Westbrook tore his meniscus in 2013 and broke his hand in 2014. And then, in 2014, a Jones fracture was detected in Durant’s right foot, and the details of that injury are more astonishing than most anyone knows.</p>\n<p>On Oct. 16, 2014, doctors inserted a screw into Durant’s foot and projected a return in six to eight weeks. He was back in the lineup by Dec. 2, but the pain persisted. Durant changed his shoes regularly, trying to manufacture comfort. According to Dr. Martin O’Malley, one of the consulting physicians, Durant’s size 19, triple-A foot was the culprit. It’s extremely long with an unusual curvature. “Pictures of Kevin’s feet look like hockey sticks,” O’Malley says. It was so narrow, the head of the screw was irritating the bone adjacent to it.</p>\n<p>On Feb. 22, 2015, Durant underwent another procedure, this time to insert a headless screw, one sunk deeper into the bone. And then, after four weeks and no contact, O’Malley says, Durant broke his foot <i>again—in</i> the exact same place.</p>\n<p>O’Malley recommended a bone graft using a piece of Durant’s pelvis, plus a synthetic graft made from bone proteins that would form a large, thick bone around the outside of Durant’s foot for extra protection. In a sense, O’Malley was creating a bionic foot, a technique he’d never tried on NBA players. ing him meals. “I was the MVP one minute and in a wheelchair the next,” Durant says. “It was awful.” His thoughts spiraled. <i>What if the graft doesn’t take? There were no other medical options. What if my career is over?</i></p>\n<p>After three weeks, he graduated to a motorized scooter. Brooks tried to keep KD engaged by encouraging him to draw up plays and inviting him to coaches’ meetings, but Durant knew the drill: If you can’t play, you might as well be invisible. Five weeks later, he was ambulatory but still banned from the gym, so he passed the time tinkering in the sound studio in his OKC home. When his friend Drake invited him to Montreal for a show in May, Durant realized that for once there was no reason he couldn’t go. He assumed Montreal was just like Toronto, where he’d been to play the Raptors. “But then I got there and everyone was speaking French,” he laughs. “I was like, <i>Man, I gotta get out more.</i>”</p>\n<p>His normal routine in a big city was this: stay within the confines of the hotel, eat his meals, hunker down for a pregame nap. But in Montreal, Durant walked around uninhibited, spending two days in a hockey town window-shopping and munching on Canadian pastries. “When I came home from that weekend, I felt so refreshed, and so different. Ever since then, my lens has widened.”</p>\n<p>With what he craved most—shooting hoops—still forbidden, he surveyed his landscape and realized his world needed a jolt of reality. For the first time in his life, he would venture out of his basketball bubble. “Basketball was out,” he says. “So I thought, <i>Let me go out and see this world I’m in.</i>”</p>\n<p>Later that summer, on an annual overseas Nike trip, Durant rented a mountain bike in Madrid. He spent an afternoon tooling around the city. He dined at an outdoor café and lounged on a stoop. He people-watched.</p>\n<p>In 2016, when The Players’ Tribune offered him a press pass for Super Bowl 50, he jumped at the chance, clicking sideline photos of Peyton Manning’s final game. He developed a renewed interest in his business ventures. He’d always entrusted his AAU program in the DC area to his dad, but now KD had questions: <i>Why aren’t all the kids wearing my shoes? Do we have a community service component to our program? </i></p>\n<p>“These were desperate times,” O’Malley says. “I told Kevin, ‘I’ve never had an NBA player lose his career over a Jones fracture.’ But I couldn’t cut and reshape Kevin’s foot. It was scary. We were all freaking out a bit.”</p>\n<p>After O’Malley operated on March 31, at the Hospital for Special Surgery in New York City, Durant’s orders were to remain completely immobile for the next six weeks. No weight on the foot. No basketball.</p>\n<p>He was a prisoner in his own world. His mother flew out to care for him, parceling out his meds, changing his sheets and serv-</p>\n<p>It was, he now says, “a young player learning about what comes next. I have a short period in my life where I’m going to play basketball. Hopefully I’m going to live to be 85 years old, maybe more. I owe it to myself to experience everything that’s out there.”</p>\n<p><b>NOW BACK IN</b> DC in late February, in that hospital room facing news of yet another potentially season-ending injury, Durant knew what he had to do: He had to lean on the lessons he’d learned two years earlier.</p>\n<p><i>There’s more to life than basketball.</i></p>\n<p>His deliberations on leaving OKC had been agonizing. He hated disappointing people. He’d paced his Hamptons hotel room until the wee hours of the morning. When he ultimately opted for Golden State, “he wasn’t spraying champagne and screaming ‘Warriors!’” Kleiman says. “He couldn’t move.” Overnight, Durant had been vilified as a turncoat, a front-runner, a phony. “It was surprising,” Green says. “Kevin Durant was the kid with the backpack that everyone adored.” Still, if he’d gotten through that, he could get through this.</p>\n<p>Back in the Warriors’ locker room, the injury was already casting a pall. The coaches, in touch with Kleiman by phone, had purposely refrained from telling the players what they’d heard. But Green, texting with Durant, was under no such restrictions. He was already quietly spreading the word from locker to locker. KD was done. Says Green: “We were all in a state of shock.”</p>\n<p>And then, as Durant was heading back to the team hotel at the Four Seasons, the doctor called with astonishing news: The CT scan had revealed a deep bruise of the tibia, <i>not</i> a break. The new diagnosis? A sprained MCL. Durant would be back by the end of the regular season.</p>\n<p><b>THIS TIME, THIS</b> injury, Durant knew what to do. With eight weeks off in a new city, he would lean heavily on the culture that surrounded him. He took a trip 90 miles north to Sonoma County to learn how soils and climates affect the body of a fine wine. He transformed himself into something of a foodie, exploring the restaurants of Oakland and San Francisco. When Wanda visited in the fall, he picked one of his new favorite spots, Tosca Cafe, and escorted her to a private table in the corner. The two shared a hearty pasta meal with meatballs that Wanda swears were as big as baseballs. Some nights, he startled Bay Area fans by taking in a Giants or A’s baseball game, hot dog in hand, baseball cap jammed on his head.</p>\n<p>“I think it has been liberating for him to be here,” says Warriors guard Shaun Livingston. “He’s living on his own terms, maybe for the first time ever.”</p>\n<p>Still, no matter how often Durant insists his move to Oakland was not merely to win a championship, the naysayers will have their say. Their narrative is clear: If the Warriors win a title, Durant will have accomplished what everyone expects. If they lose, KD is the guy who still can’t get it done.</p>\n<p>“And what if we do win?” asks Warriors GM Bob Myers. “Are we supposed to close the book on everything? Do we stop? Does Kevin not play basketball anymore?”</p>\n<p>“Two or three years ago, that stuff would have bothered me,” Durant says. “Not anymore. I’m having fun and enjoying my life. I know they want me to be miserable, but I’m not. Sorry.” Win or lose, the plan is now the same at the house in the hills.

I’m 10, and it’s almost summer, which means I have to go to my cousin Rhonda’s to get braids. I don’t want to. Everyone at school thinks braids are weird. Everyone at school is white. Which is worse, my mom asks, having to explain why I can’t get in the water at the pool party or having to explain what braids are? Both options make me cringe. When I taught all my friends the word “extensions,” they wouldn’t stop using it. Then, when a stray braid was found near the library, it was like something out of a Hitchcock film: a crowd of white children wailing and pointing and laughing in a circle around me. My self-hatred became something palpable, something ugly and inadequate and all wrong. Everything about my life was embarrassing, especially the shame I felt about myself.</p>\n<p>“The function, the very serious function of racism, is distraction,” Toni Morrison once said. “It keeps you explaining, over and over again, your reason for being.” In practice, this distraction can take many forms. <i>Why is your hair like that? Wait, you don’t have any real hair?</i> For me, a function of racism is embarrassment. I don’t mean awkwardness—the fleeting moments that follow faux pas—I mean wanting to be erased.</p>\n<p>Southern California, 1999. My dad calls me downstairs. Our family settles in on the couch, mesmerized. Two black girls are on TV doing something important. They are winning, and they are black girls with beads in their braids. They are black girls from Compton, from around the way, and there’s their dad, doing what black dads do—cupping the backs of their heads with his hands and bringing them in for a hug, urging them never to be anything but the best version of themselves. Their smiles are the kinds of smiles you earn. My burgeoning poet’s brain is awestruck by the crisp sound of ball meeting racket, the liberal use of the word love, the way the players’ bodies move through the air like comet tails. This is elegance, discipline, precision. I see myself. <i>Take that</i>, I think.</p>\n<p>Serena Williams grows up and I grow up. I watch her rise and reign. Cosmically, it feels important to me that she exists in this world, persistently and reliably, holding her spot in her field as I stake a claim for myself in mine. She trains, I write, we grow up. They try to tug at the string of insecurity. They call us angry. They call us cocky, overweight. We have gotten <i>too big for our britches</i>, our black dads would say. We can’t help it if our ambition, our honesty and conviction, isn’t what you want from us. They say our time is up. We act like it doesn’t bother us.</p>\n<p>New York, 2009. I don’t want to get out of bed. I dodge calls from my therapist, who’s only three blocks away from my dorm. I don’t go to classes for a week. I feel burdensome and misunderstood. I’m embarrassed by my depression, that it is a constant fact of my life. <i>The New York Times</i> says Serena has had a “meltdown,” has an “aggressive demeanor” and “intimidating body language.” They say she’s unraveling, respectability and class dripping off her like sweat. She later acknowledges her battle with depression, and everywhere she looks there is scrutiny. Her language appalls them, frightens them, which is to say her personhood, her humanity, appalls them.</p>\n<p>The world tells black women to be embarrassed. About our hair, about our thighs, about our abilities, about our voices. Women are told to make themselves small and quiet. Black women are told that we’re scary. If black women listened to every voice in the stands, we would believe that as soon as we reveal ourselves to be human—to be vulnerable or opinionated rather than neat, elegant, demure—we become extinct. Audacity is self-esteem.</p>\n<p>It isn’t that Serena Williams is invincible, only that she understands that boundaries are constructed so we might be embarrassed to cross them. She isn’t a miracle; she has merely stepped into her own light, her own possibility, and gotten comfortable there. Of course we can be the best. Why should it be shameful or bold to say so? Why should pride and ambition be kept secret? What if self-assurance doesn’t erase humility?</p>\n<p>When I see Serena’s baby bump now, I realize she has the same smile she did at 17. She has earned it. She’s still here, where she’s always been. We’ve grown up together and become more of ourselves. I put books into the world and I realize I’m not much different from the girl who sat at the lunch tables writing stories and poems. It can feel like no one expects black women to survive—sometimes, not even us. But even as rare as survival is, we don’t have to settle for it. Serena has shown me that we can walk through the boundaries. We are worthy of anything we allow ourselves to have, and we need not apologize for it.</p>\n<p>What is incredible about Serena Williams is that people have stopped being astonished by the incongruity of a black girl from Compton with a tennis racket, and it’s because she made them stop. The public waits for an opening, a slipup, some justification to revoke her title, to make her into a nostalgic blip. But she doesn’t give them the press bait. She doesn’t hide in the bathroom wanting to disappear when she loses a braid in front of her white friends—she looks everyone in the eyes and says, “What?” Incidentally, braids have made a miraculous comeback. I pile mine high atop my head like a trophy.</p>\n<p><i>Morgan Parker has written two poetry collections,</i> Other People’s Comfort Keeps Me Up at Night <i>and</i> There Are More Beautiful Things Than Beyonce<i>.</i></p>\n<p class=\"byline\"><b>BY MORGAN PARKER</b></p>\n","layout":{"landscape":{"id":"am-rs-landscape-2","link":"feature-l.twig"},"portrait":{"id":"am-rs-portrait-2","link":"feature.twig"}},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":1,"link_source":"","image":[{"id":"zinio_espnus170612_article_060_01_image_0_1496159853.3221","name":"espnus170612_article_060_01_01","source":"PHOTO ILLUSTRATION BY JOSUE EVILLA SUSAN MULLANE/USA TODAY SPORTS","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_143/storage/images/media2/images/espnus170612_article_060_01_01/4520852-1-eng-US/espnus170612_article_060_01_012.jpg?t=story_img_size_768x0&ext/espnus170612_article_060_01_012_story_img_size_768x0.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"1774","height":"1650","legacy_id":"883117","is_default":true},{"id":"zinio_espnus170612_article_060_01_image_0_1496159853.3221","name":"espnus170612_article_060_01_01","source":"PHOTO ILLUSTRATION BY JOSUE EVILLA SUSAN MULLANE/USA TODAY SPORTS","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_143/storage/images/media2/images/espnus170612_article_060_01_01/4520852-1-eng-US/espnus170612_article_060_01_012.jpg?t=story_img_size_768x0&ext/espnus170612_article_060_01_012_story_img_size_768x0.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"1774","height":"1650","legacy_id":"883117","is_default":false}],"url_alias":"http://espnthemagazine-us.audiencemedia.com","type":"story","order":"16","folio_number":"60","folio_numbers":"60,61","pdf_page_index":"60","thumbnail":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_143/storage/images/media2/images/espnus170612_article_060_01_01/4520852-1-eng-US/espnus170612_article_060_01_012.jpg?t=tablet_story_thumbnail&ext/espnus170612_article_060_01_012_tablet_story_thumbnail.jpg","color":"ef3e36","real_id":"883116","main_section_id":"1406","ads":[]},{"id":"zinio_661_espnus170612_article_062_01_1496159854.4906","title":"WILL YOU STILL RYAN LOCHTE BY THE END OF THIS STORY?","sub_title":"","author":[{"id":"0","name":"BY ALLISON GLOCK PHOTOGRAPHS BY EMILY SHUR","email":"noreply@audiencemedia.com","is_default":false}],"tag":"","strap_line":"WORLD FAME 100","intro":"In consideration of fireworks, massages, Olympic gold, reality TV, marriage, fatherhood—and that incident in Rio.","body":"<p class=\"byline\">\n<b>BY ALLISON GLOCK</b><br /><b>PHOTOGRAPHS BY EMILY SHUR</b></p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_143/storage/images/media2/images/espnus170612_article_062_01_01/4520897-1-eng-US/espnus170612_article_062_01_012.jpg\" width=\"2457\" height=\"1655\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"espnus170612_article_062_01_01\" title=\"espnus170612_article_062_01_01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p><b>RANK 67</b></p>\n<p><b>RYAN LOCHTE</b></p>\n<p><b>COUNTRY USA</b></p>\n<p><b>SPORT SWIMMING</b></p>\n<p><b>ENDORSEMENTS $800K</b></p>\n<p><b>FACEBOOK FOLLOWERS 628K</b></p>\n<p><b>TWITTER FOLLOWERS 1.2 M </b></p>\n<p><b>WHEN RYAN LOCHTE</b> enters Nail Paradise in Beverly Hills, the aestheticians rush him like pigeons to a loaf of bread.

While most professional athletes get massages several times a week, they’re unusual for him. Training or not, Lochte has never been the best at self-care, preferring instead to err on the side of fun, which for him means all manner of Florida backwoods tomfoolery, something Kyle Deery, his closest friend from childhood, describes as a “Hey, we’ve got 140 bottle rockets, you better start running” kind of thing.</p>\n<p>Lochte says the last fireworks war happened this winter, and while he understands that blowing his fingers off would likely impede any future swimming aspirations, that understanding wasn’t enough to deter him from chasing Deery around the yard as they launched lit explosives at each other.</p>\n<p>“Man, I miss that guy,” Lochte says, rolling his neck.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_143/storage/images/media2/images/espnus170612_article_062_01_02/4520890-1-eng-US/espnus170612_article_062_01_022.jpg\" width=\"1339\" height=\"919\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"espnus170612_article_062_01_02\" title=\"espnus170612_article_062_01_02\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>Lochte says his fiancée, Kayla Rae Reid, and baby (due in June) have given him new purpose.</b></p>\n <span class=\"credit\">\nHAIRSTYLING: JESUS GUERRERO; MAKEUP: TAMMY PHAM; PROP STYLING: WARD ROBINSON FOR WOODEN LADDER</span></figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p class=\"pullQuote\"><b>“THERE WERE A COUPLE OF POINTS WHERE I WAS CRYING, THINKING, ‘IF I GO TO BED AND NEVER WAKE UP, FINE.’”</b></p>\n<p>Lochte met Deery when they were both 12 and Deery had been ejected from swim practice for mouthing off. “Ryan came in, introduced himself and turned the punishment into a party,” Deery fondly recounts. “He stopped me from sulking.”</p>\n<p>This was back when Lochte was a preternaturally gifted teen athlete, crushing multiple sports and making hay in the pines of Daytona, throwing rocks, surfing hurricanes, riding bicycles barefoot through the family home and into the pool.</p>\n<p>“We had him tested,” his father, Steve, recalls. Teachers suggested ADHD medication. But Steve had other ideas for channeling his son’s energy. “We raced at everything. We would chug our milk to see who could drink the fastest. We’d see who could run and get the paper out of the mailbox first. I built in competitiveness.”</p>\n<p>Focus was a tougher row, says Steve, also his son’s swim coach at the time. “Ryan was more interested in pulling on kids’ legs, laying on the bottom of the pool and waving as they swam over.” Sent to the showers as a reprimand, Lochte made mischief there too, plugging up the drains so he could skate on his butt across the tile flooring. Even so, “Ryan would go to the big meets and usually win.”</p>\n<p>“Ryan was all about racing,” Steve continues. “He hated practice, but when I said, ‘OK, we’re going to do a time trial,’ he’d be the first one on the starting blocks.”</p>\n<p>Then, at 13, Lochte narrowly lost a Junior Olympic Championship race to his friend Brent Arckey, and afterward, as he stared out the passenger window on State Road 40, watching the trees tick by in the Ocala National Forest, he arrived at a conclusion: Losing sucked.</p>\n<p>“I said, ‘Son, what are you going to do about it then?’” Steve remembers. Even now he can picture the unusually grave look on his child’s face when he answered.</p>\n<p>“I’m never going to let it happen again.”</p>\n<p>Largely, Lochte didn’t. He’s won six gold medals, 12 overall, which puts him second in the pantheon of Olympic swimmers, behind Michael Phelps and ahead of Mark Spitz. He holds multiple world records and—for better and worse—name recognition.</p>\n<p>“Ryan and Michael made swimming for boys cool,” says storied USC swim coach Dave Salo, who is working with Lochte toward a bid for 2020. “Swimming is grueling. It’s mindless, it’s boring. Ryan tries to put a face to the sport that at least is bearable and a little funny.”</p>\n<p>Salo also sees strategy behind the clowning: “Everybody knows Ryan, everybody has an opinion of Ryan. Everybody is talking about Ryan one way or the other. I think he’s probably playing us all for fools a little bit.”</p>\n<p>The prospect of Lochte subversively masterminding a campaign for cultural relevance is one deeply at odds with a common public perception of him as a—but not limited to—grade-A doofus, poster child of white male privilege, irredeemable narcissist, “jeah” brah, Olympic Village idiot, guy who can’t count to 11 unless he’s naked, human vape pen, king of jock mountain.</p>\n<p>In truth, Lochte probably isn’t devoting his limited free hours to mastering the complex algorithms of image maintenance, à la Taylor Swift. But this is less because he is dim than because of the underappreciated fact that Lochte has never tried to pretend that he’s someone he’s not. He’s the Jimmy Fallon of world-class athletes—benign, thirsty for love, sporadically amusing and prone to spontaneous, ill-considered decisions that make him seem more callow than he actually is. Fame was never Lochte’s goal, just the knotty byproduct of what his friends call “Ryan being Ryan.” As Lochte explains: “My shoes with the teddy bears. My grill. That stuff was meant to lighten the mood. I mean, this world is so negative. If I can put a little bit of fun in people’s lives, then I’m cool with that.”</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_143/storage/images/media2/images/espnus170612_article_062_01_03/4520883-1-eng-US/espnus170612_article_062_01_032.jpg\" width=\"194\" height=\"901\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"espnus170612_article_062_01_03\" title=\"espnus170612_article_062_01_03\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>Lochte recognized early that most of life is lived outside the pool, his ambition rooted in personality, not medal count. “For Ryan, it’s always more about not losing than winning,” his father says. The avoidance of failure, rather than wrathful domination. (Avoidance is a theme in Lochte’s life. “In practice, the coach will be yelling at a swimmer to change his stroke, and I will listen, observe and change it so that he’ll never yell at me.”)</p>\n<p>Teammates and colleagues say Lochte is not a gloater, a BOOM-drop-the-mic guy. He wins, then he swims to celebrate everyone else. “He’s always been patient, generous, even at practice,” Salo says. “People are looking at Ryan as if he’s a douchebag? I’ve seen him at a world championship give his gold medal to some random kid in the crowd. Michael never did that. I heard last month Ryan spent hours signing for Masters swimmers. I mean, my god, these are old people.”</p>\n<p>“I was that kid looking up to an Olympic swimmer,” Lochte explains, describing a formative encounter when he asked an idol for an autograph in a hotel elevator and was disdainfully refused. “I went back upstairs, crying, and told my dad, ‘If I’m ever in that position, I’ll never say no.’”</p>\n<p>Lochte has kept his word. He says no to very little. He picks up tabs, shares his sandwiches. He goes along to get along, eats at restaurants he doesn’t like, gives away his things—electronics, clothes, awards—when people in his life admire or covet said things. In college, at the University of Florida, Lochte used his medal money to buy tricked-out car stereos for his friends, installing them over the weekend as a surprise. By all accounts, he is ride or die, as you wish, boundaryless to the point of concern.</p>\n<p>“It goes back to me always wanting to make everyone happy,” Lochte says. “At a bar, I’ll buy shots for the entire place. I can’t change it, as much as I want to.” (On a related note, Lochte says he’s never been to therapy.)</p>\n<p>Lochte knows his urge to be “that guy” makes him an easy mark. “It’s his Achilles’ heel,” says teammate Cullen Jones of Lochte’s compulsive people-pleasing. “He loves hard, to a fault. When people get around him, they never want to leave. Anyone who has spent time with him literally wants to protect him.”</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_143/storage/images/media2/images/espnus170612_article_062_01_04/4520876-1-eng-US/espnus170612_article_062_01_042.jpg\" width=\"908\" height=\"655\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"espnus170612_article_062_01_04\" title=\"espnus170612_article_062_01_04\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>Lochte’s Olympic medal count puts him second all time among U.S. swimmers, behind Michael Phelps and ahead of Mark Spitz.</b></p>\n <span class=\"credit\">\nMARTIN MEISSNER/AP PHOTO</span></figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>There are also moments, Lochte reveals, when he wishes “the fame and everything I’ve gotten had never happened.”</p>\n<p>“I was a really good basketball player,” he says wistfully. “But my love for the water was unbreakable. I step in, everything disappears. Sometimes I wish I could stay underwater forever.”</p>\n<p><b>THE BEVERLY HILLS</b> Hotel Cabana Cafe is rarely short on celebrity. Even so, the poolside diners crane their necks to stare as Lochte slinks by, toes turned inward in his bleach-white Vans, an equally white tee showcasing his SPF-be-damned sunburn. He slides into a corner banquette beside his fiancée, <i>Playboy</i> model Kayla Rae Reid, in full makeup and lashes, a roomy sweater draped over her pregnant belly, which Lochte pats absently.</p>\n<p>“We want him to speak a second language,” Lochte says of his son, due in June. “Probably Spanish,” as a nod to Lochte’s Cuban mother, Ileana.</p>\n<p>After ordering a salad and a Coke, Lochte begins to open up about the Rio fallout for the first time, his right knee jackhammering wildly underneath the table.</p>\n<p>“You can be at the all-time high and then the next second the all-time low,” he says ruefully. “I love being at the Olympics, but I’m the opposite of what you’d expect. It’s been that way my whole life. I don’t fit in.”</p>\n<p>Reid is more direct, arguing that Olympic athletes aren’t allowed to be playful, or messy, or real—that they’re released every four years like fireworks, glorious to behold, swooned over in the moment, then largely forgotten until the next special occasion. (As Jones explained, when shite goes pear-shaped, “it’s not like next week you can throw up 40 points and have everyone love you again.”)</p>\n<p>In Rio, the pear-shaping started when Lochte and swimmers Gunnar Bentz, Jack Conger and James Feigen made a pit stop and relieved themselves in a filling station hedge. Lochte, per statements from his teammates, also pulled a framed advertisement to the ground. Surveillance video showed the swimmers detained by armed officials who demanded money for the damages before letting them depart in their cab. The men paid and returned to the Olympic Village, where the incident would have been quickly forgotten had Lochte not exaggerated the retelling to his mom, who in turn shared with the media that her superstar son had been robbed at gunpoint. Lochte then repeated his early exaggerations on camera to the <i>Today</i> show, and an international scandal was born.</p>\n<p>The actual sins of the swimmers were well below average on the pearl-clutching scale. Many professional athletes have been excused for much darker behavior (see: Michael Vick, Adrian Peterson, Phelps drunk-driving charge), as have other public figures. Brian Williams lied and exaggerated about his heroism in wars, and he has his own news program. Robert Downey Jr. went from dope fiend to Iron Man. Even drunk-driving bigot Mel Gibson is getting fresh love because he made a decent movie last year.</p>\n<p>“People wanted a reason to hate me,” Lochte says about his crimes and misdemeanors. And he gave them one: His initial deceptions, combined with his feeding of racially based perceptions of crime, generated a perfect storm of global righteous indignation, all directed tsunami-style at Lochte.</p>\n<p>“Everything was blown out of proportion,” Reid says, stabbing at a forkful of lettuce.</p>\n<p><i>Were you completely hammered</i>?</p>\n<p>“Oh, we were, yeah,” Lochte says sheepishly. “And that’s why—”</p>\n<p>“They were celebrating their victory,” Reid interjects. “At the time, I really had to sew my mouth shut.” She shakes her head, cheeks flushed. “People treated him like he murdered somebody.”</p>\n<p>When Lochte arrived home in Charlotte (on what he says was a prescheduled flight), there were a dozen media vans outside his house. He watched the news, read the online comments, the searing articles outlining how “Ryan Lochte Is the Worst!” In days, he lost every sponsor. He also received death threats. At a public appearance, Reid had a glass thrown at her head.</p>\n<p>“After Rio, I was probably the most hated person in the world,” Lochte mumbles. “There were a couple of points where I was crying, thinking, ‘If I go to bed and never wake up, fine.’” Asked if that means he considered suicide, Lochte nods slowly. “I was about to hang up my entire life.”</p>\n<p>Reid’s jaw stiffens. She strokes Lochte’s shoulder, eyes narrowed with concern. He takes a deep breath, looks around the pool at the diners blithely snacking on fruit salads and cheeseburgers. After a beat, he forces a smile.</p>\n<p>“Everything happens for a reason,” he offers with moderate conviction. “Look, I was done with swimming back in 2013. I was drained, wiped out. Now I’ve found a new purpose with my son. This fire has been ignited, and it’s bigger than ever, and I’m just so excited because I know what’s going to happen in Tokyo. Everyone is going to have to watch out!”</p>\n<p>Lochte starts giggling, a little embarrassed. Reid says no one should underestimate her man, even though he will turn 36 in 2020. Lochte is visibly grateful for her belief in him, and the conversation shifts to how they met in January of last year, a whirlwind courtship in which their first date was an unanticipated seven-hour heart-to-heart on a couch, a chaste and illuminating turn of events that left them both convinced they’d found “the one.”</p>\n<p>“I wasn’t interested in him at first,” Reid shares. “I’d heard he was a party guy. He was so different than what I imagined.”</p>\n<p>Lochte had his own epiphany.</p>\n<p>“You know when you meet someone for the first time and you have your guard up and don’t want to be too intimate about certain things?” he asks rhetorically. “I didn’t have my guard up. It was like talking with my best friend.”</p>\n<p>Lochte has wanted a family for years, he says. He’s been lonely. Exhausted. And now that he’s found his person, he is devoted in a way that would make Hallmark envious. He proposed by flying his intended to a beachside cliff via helicopter, a table with champagne and roses set below, a photographer hired and hiding in the brush. Reid suspected something was up when she held Lochte’s hand in flight and it was clammy.</p>\n<p>The notion of Lochte planning and executing every detail of a complicated, cinematic proposal is one most casual observers would find surprising, another presumption that “bothers” Reid, who admits that she has never watched her fiancé’s short-lived reality show—What <i>Would Ryan Lochte Do</i>?—and likely never will. “It’s fake,” she says flatly.</p>\n<p>“They had me drinking nonstop,” recalls Lochte. “Eight in the morning, a drink in my hand. I’m like, my liver is about to fail,” he says, laughing. “And anything I said, they’d say, ‘All right, let’s do this scene over, and Ryan, say it like this.’” (Producers did not respond to our request for comment.) Lochte shrugs. “Not many people can say they had their own TV show,” he says, sneaking a single french fry off Reid’s plate and popping it in his mouth.</p>\n<p>“You watch from afar and you’re like, why are you doing this?” says coach Salo, before adding: “But you can probably name three swimmers, maybe four. They’ve got a short window to distinguish themselves. Somebody’s got to pay the bills.”</p>\n<p>According to Jones, the price Lochte paid for that visibility was steep. “Everyone thinks he’s an idiot, and he’s not. Far from it.</p>\n<p>The way people approach him? If they came at me that way, I’d be very upset, I’d feel disrespected. And Ryan being Ryan, he’s just, ‘Cullen, chill, its fine.’” Jones pauses, sighs. “I think it bothers him more than he lets on, but trust me, he will <i>never</i> let on.”</p>\n<p><b>THERE’S NO TROPHY</b> case in the current Lochte rental house. No photographs with presidents, no framed clippings, not one piece of evidence that Lochte is the second-most decorated swimmer of all time. Instead, there is a vintage framed portrait of Marilyn Monroe in a tutu; a white, wooded letter L propped beside a tasteful vase of lilies; more white pillar candles than in Mariah Carey’s dressing room. The general aesthetic is soft, minimal. The one personal photograph on the wall is a 5-by-7 of the happy couple at the moment of their engagement; beneath it, a bookshelf holding a hardcover of Tony Robbins’ <i>Awaken the Giant Within</i>; on the coffee table, a Dr. Spock baby guide and the <i>Playboy</i> 2017 calendar.</p>\n<p>Upstairs, the nursery is a study in blue and gray, a car seat still wrapped in cellophane, breast pump on the dresser in its box, all tidy, ready to go.</p>\n<p>“Ryan is super clean,” says Jones, who has roomed with him since they became friends at the 2005 world championships. “He’ll repack his bag seven times, refolding everything.”</p>\n<p>Over lunch at a café on Wilshire Boulevard, wearing his favorite Vans and a dress shirt that strains at the buttons, Lochte talks about his night, how he spent much-needed couch time alone, catching up on <i>Big Little Lies</i> and <i>Chrisley Knows Best</i>. On the whole, he prefers films to TV.</p>\n<p>“My favorite movie is <i>What Women Want</i>,” he says. “I could watch that on loop all day.” Lochte posits that he’d “rule the world” if he knew what women were thinking, then confides that he and Reid had a tough talk the day before. She wants him to share more, “but I don’t want to tell my s---to people. It’s not that I don’t want to change. It’s just …” Lochte falls quiet, aware this isn’t necessarily a prudent long-term strategy for marriage.</p>\n<p>Lochte’s parents divorced in 2011, the split a shock. For the first time in Lochte’s life, his dad “drifted away.”</p>\n<p>“I was the daddy’s boy, the favorite,” Lochte says. “When I was born, my dad told the family, ‘Now the Lochte name will live on.’”</p>\n<p>Steve Lochte wasn’t big on praise. “‘Great’ to me, Ryan, is when a swimmer can break the world record and win the individual gold on the same day,” he’d say.</p>\n<p>In Beijing in 2008, Lochte did just that. In footage after the win, you can watch as he scrambles up the bleachers into his father’s arms, pressing against the railing, where Steve whispered in his son’s ear the words Ryan had longed to hear his whole life: “Today you’re great.”</p>\n<p>Steve did not attend the Rio Olympics. Lochte rejects any suggestion that a rift with his father contributed to the Rio debacle. “Of course I’m sad about it. I so wish he were there. I wish he was there every day of my life, but when it’s time for me to do my job, it’s time for me to do my job.”</p>\n<p>As for the antics that followed doing the job, Lochte claims he knows better now. “You learn from your mistakes,” he says. “Am I going to be perfect? No.”</p>\n<p>He points to a hatch of scars across his knuckles, evidence of youthful scraps. “My first fight I got knocked down. I was so scared before that. But then I realized I wasn’t made of glass. I could get back up.”</p>\n<p>Lunch done, Lochte walks cheerfully down the street. When recognized, he poses for photos, smiles, pushes his chin toward the lens. “Honestly? To this day, if someone comes up and says they want a picture or an autograph, I’m like, for real? Me?”</p>\n<p>He talks about the Olympics, how he hates being so isolated. He prefers cutting up with his friends, communing with the fans, craving the chance to make someone, anyone, happy.</p>\n<p>He decides to share a secret about his time there, when cameras from hundreds of nations are trained on his every wink and nod.</p>\n<p>“When you see me on TV wearing headphones by the pool?” he whispers, blue eyes twinkling conspiratorially. “There isn’t any music playing.”</p>\n","layout":{"landscape":{"id":"am-rs-landscape-2","link":"feature-l.twig"},"portrait":{"id":"am-rs-portrait-2","link":"feature.twig"}},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":1,"link_source":"","image":[{"id":"zinio_espnus170612_article_062_01_image_0_1496159856.5918","name":"espnus170612_article_062_01_01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_143/storage/images/media2/images/espnus170612_article_062_01_01/4520897-1-eng-US/espnus170612_article_062_01_012.jpg?t=story_img_size_768x0&ext/espnus170612_article_062_01_012_story_img_size_768x0.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"2457","height":"1655","legacy_id":"883123","is_default":true},{"id":"zinio_espnus170612_article_062_01_image_0_1496159856.5918","name":"espnus170612_article_062_01_01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_143/storage/images/media2/images/espnus170612_article_062_01_01/4520897-1-eng-US/espnus170612_article_062_01_012.jpg?t=story_img_size_768x0&ext/espnus170612_article_062_01_012_story_img_size_768x0.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"2457","height":"1655","legacy_id":"883123","is_default":false}],"related_objects":{"image":[{"id":"zinio_espnus170612_article_062_01_image_3_1496159854.5862","name":"espnus170612_article_062_01_04","source":"MARTIN MEISSNER/AP PHOTO","caption":"<p><b>Lochte’s Olympic medal count puts him second all time among U.S. swimmers, behind Michael Phelps and ahead of Mark Spitz.</b></p>\n","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_143/storage/images/media2/images/espnus170612_article_062_01_04/4520876-1-eng-US/espnus170612_article_062_01_042.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"908","height":"655","legacy_id":"883120"},{"id":"zinio_espnus170612_article_062_01_image_3_1496159854.5862","name":"espnus170612_article_062_01_04","source":"MARTIN MEISSNER/AP PHOTO","caption":"<p><b>Lochte’s Olympic medal count puts him second all time among U.S. swimmers, behind Michael Phelps and ahead of Mark Spitz.</b></p>\n","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_143/storage/images/media2/images/espnus170612_article_062_01_04/4520876-1-eng-US/espnus170612_article_062_01_042.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"908","height":"655","legacy_id":"883120"},{"id":"zinio_espnus170612_article_062_01_image_2_1496159855.1758","name":"espnus170612_article_062_01_03","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_143/storage/images/media2/images/espnus170612_article_062_01_03/4520883-1-eng-US/espnus170612_article_062_01_032.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"194","height":"901","legacy_id":"883121"},{"id":"zinio_espnus170612_article_062_01_image_2_1496159855.1758","name":"espnus170612_article_062_01_03","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_143/storage/images/media2/images/espnus170612_article_062_01_03/4520883-1-eng-US/espnus170612_article_062_01_032.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"194","height":"901","legacy_id":"883121"},{"id":"zinio_espnus170612_article_062_01_image_1_1496159855.7686","name":"espnus170612_article_062_01_02","source":"HAIRSTYLING: JESUS GUERRERO;

He has flown from Sochi, Russia, to New York, and he needs to leave his hotel room in the next 20 minutes for the most exclusive of celebrity social events—the Met Gala. But he’s not ready.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_143/storage/images/media2/images/espnus170612_article_070_01_02/4521018-1-eng-US/espnus170612_article_070_01_022.jpg\" width=\"846\" height=\"1031\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"espnus170612_article_070_01_02\" title=\"espnus170612_article_070_01_02\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>Hamilton sees time off the track as key to his F1 success. It’s more than work: “That’s not what this is all about. You have to enjoy it.”</b></p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>Hamilton’s problem isn’t the perfectly tailored green velvet tuxedo that Dolce &amp; Gabbana provided. It isn’t the subtle black bow tie, choker tight so it won’t show up crooked in any red carpet photos. And it certainly isn’t the look-at-me black-and-gold-patterned slip-ons he’s rocking sans socks. It’s his hair.</p>\n<p>The 32-year-old’s regular stylist just had a baby, so there’s someone new in charge of Hamilton’s head. But instead of the tight curls he prefers, the end result looks a bit more like large ringlets. And once Hamilton finds something he isn’t happy with, he can’t let it go. His perfectionist ways are why his friends call him Hawkeye; he sees things no one else does, be it a narrow gap to make a pass on the track or a single thread out of place during a photo shoot. And on a night like this, when appearance is everything, bad hair simply won’t cut it.</p>\n<p>Five years ago, this wouldn’t have been an issue. Hamilton’s former F1 team, McLaren, would have discouraged him from hopping the Atlantic for such see-and-be-seen tabloid fodder. Lewis’ father, Anthony, his onetime manager, also would’ve disapproved. “It was very restrictive,” Hamilton says now. But in 2010, he fired his dad. And in 2012, Hamilton left McLaren for Mercedes. Now he spends Easter with Kim and Kanye, parties with Rihanna in Barbados and is a stage-side staple at the biggest fashion shows in the world.</p>\n<p>More freedom brought more checkered flags, with Hamilton winning his second and third world championships in 2014 and 2015 and finishing second last year. Five races into the 2017 season, heading into Monaco, he was again second, six points behind Ferrari’s Sebastian Vettel.</p>\n<p>His on-track success and elevated celebrity status come as Hamilton enters the final phase of his racing career, and it’s led to a once-preposterous thought: Can Lewis Hamilton become not only the greatest F1 driver of his generation but also one of the biggest celebrities of any stripe in the world?</p>\n<p>For now, the Met Gala, with its $30,000 tickets and ultra-exclusive guest list featuring the likes of Taylor Swift, Beyonce and Jay Z, awaits. Hamilton texts his fashion stylist, and reinforcements arrive within minutes. There is water, a dab of mousse and a bit of hair spray. The curls are restyled, piece by piece. After lotion, cologne and a quick clipping of his fingernails, Hamilton approves. Time to go.</p>\n<p>“This isn’t fun,” Hamilton says. “This is business. It’s all part of the takeover.”</p>\n<p><b>FOR MOST FORMULA ONE</b> drivers, the postrace routine is simple: Head home, eat, sleep, rest, repeat. “They wake up and breathe racing,” Hamilton says. “But that’s not what this is all about. You have to enjoy it.”</p>\n<p>Hamilton, Britain’s richest sportsman, worth a reported $250 million, unapologetically finds enjoyment in million-dollar cars, a cherry-red private jet and homes in Monte Carlo and Colorado. He lives out of a suitcase 300 days a year, jet-setting here and there for the latest red carpet affair. Where other drivers do whatever’s asked to please the F1 elite, Hamilton follows his own plan. There are shirtless, hey-look-at-my-chiseled-abs selfies on Instagram. His own personal logo, à la Jordan, Tiger or Messi. He dated Nicole Scherzinger of the Pussycat Dolls. And it’s perfectly normal to spot Beyonce, Bieber or a Kardashian in the F1 paddock cheering his No. 44 Mercedes.</p>\n<p>Last year F1 instructed him not to Snap-chat at the track. He still did, using rabbit and fox filters on himself and another driver. It didn’t go over well with the British media, and Hamilton walked out of a news conference after suggesting everyone lighten up. You also don’t make friends by racking up 33 victories in the past four seasons while other active drivers have won 11 combined.</p>\n<p>In the final race of 2016, teammate Nico Rosberg needed only to finish third to win the championship. Hamilton led, but with Rosberg in second, he defied Mercedes and slowed to let the rest of the field gain on the leaders. His gamble didn’t pay off. Hamilton won the race, Rosberg the title. “I like to smile, laugh and have a good time,” he says. “Having said that, am I stubborn? Hell motherf---ing yeah. Do I hate losing? Hell motherf---ing yeah. People say I finished second and I should be happy? F--- no. I trained my ass off to be first. Not second, first. And sometimes people forget that.”</p>\n<p>“He’s judged based not on what he does but on people’s expectations of what he should do,” Mercedes communications director Bradley Lord says. “He’s a square peg trying to fit in a round hole. When he gives up and says he doesn’t care about fitting in that hole anymore, that winds people up.”</p>\n<p>Two days after the Met Gala, in the basement of a muay thai gym in New York, Hamilton lies on the blue canvas of a boxing ring, staring at the ceiling as sweat slaloms down his cheeks. He’s halfway through a 90-minute martial arts workout. “Apparently my heart rate has a limit,” he cracks.</p>\n<p>During his set of 200 situps, a group of kids shows up for after-school karate. That was him in Stevenage, England, in the 1990s, the shy kid picked on in school who asked Dad if he could try karate. Hamilton climbed to black belt before quitting for racing. “I wish I’d never stopped,” he says. “It was great for the mind as well as the body.”</p>\n<p>Muay thai is the same. It builds mental toughness and strengthens his core without adding muscle. He has dedicated himself to dropping weight in recent years—one more advantage. On this day, there are 100 knuckle pushups, jumping jacks with 20-pound weights, 10 minutes of knee and shin kicks into a heavy bag. By the time he actually climbs into the ring to spar, he’s spent.</p>\n<p>At the same time on the other side of the Atlantic, Hamilton’s Mercedes team is at the shop in England upgrading the car it will bring to Barcelona for the Spanish Grand Prix. Everyone wants to avoid a disaster like Sochi, where Hamilton finished fourth, more than 36 seconds behind the race winner, Mercedes teammate Valtteri Bottas.</p>\n<p>For Hamilton, the key is getting away. In the two weeks between races, he will fly from Sochi to New York to Los Angeles to London and then on to Barcelona. His team actively encourages it. “The minute you put him in a box and try to squeeze him into a framework of obligations, his performance is going to suffer,” Mercedes F1 boss Toto Wolff says. “This is what happened at McLaren. How he’s set up, he wants to break free. Our aim is to help him perform well.”</p>\n<p><b>ON THE SUN-FILLED</b> Thursday afternoon before the Spanish Grand Prix near Barcelona, a herd of fans stretches 10 deep, pressing against a metal barrier, arms and selfie sticks fully extended. In a span of 20 minutes, Hamilton signs his name more than 150 times. He poses for some 30 selfies. Each step back to the Mercedes garage, there is someone waiting—fans, paramedics, volunteers, security officials, even journalists. They walk up next to Hamilton, stick their camera in his face, lean in and snap. It’s the same at every track, 20 times a year. In Austin a few years ago, one female fan fainted after meeting Hamilton.</p>\n<p class=\"pullQuote\"><b>“THERE IS MORE FOR ME. THIS IS MY SIDE HOBBY. THERE ARE OTHER THINGS I’M GREAT AT AND INTERESTED IN. WHEN I STOP, IT WILL JUST BE THE NEXT CHAPTER.”</b></p>\n<p>“I don’t get it,” Hamilton says. “When I meet people and they are starstruck with me, I find it weird. Of course I’ve met people I’ve admired, like Nelson Mandela, but not to the point of screaming and passing out.”</p>\n<p>An hour after the autograph session, Hamilton and other F1 drivers are back on the track, posing for a picture with a group of kids before a go-kart race. For most of the drivers, it’s a hi-and-bye photo op. Hamilton stays for almost 30 minutes, shooting videos on his phone while high-fiving every single kid. One boy walking by trips over Hamilton’s feet. The driver sticks his arm out and catches the kid. When the go-karts pull away, the smell of gasoline fills the air. “I miss that smell,” Hamilton says.</p>\n<p>Karting is where his story began, with Anthony Hamilton working multiple jobs, emptying his savings and taking out a second mortgage to help his son chase F1 dreams. It’s a story Hamilton says mirrors that of the Jamaican bobsled team and the movie <i>Cool Runnings</i>.</p>\n<p>“When they pull out that s--- bobsled and everyone stops and says ‘What the hell?’ I swear on my life when my dad and I showed up, everyone stopped and looked at us just like that,” Hamilton says. “And when my dad had to go around to find sponsorships and ask people if they would like to sponsor the first black F1 driver, I’m not sure they laughed like in <i>Cool Runnings</i>, but certainly not many people supported us.”</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_143/storage/images/media2/images/espnus170612_article_070_01_03/4521011-1-eng-US/espnus170612_article_070_01_032.jpg\" width=\"848\" height=\"530\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"espnus170612_article_070_01_03\" title=\"espnus170612_article_070_01_03\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div>\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_143/storage/images/media2/images/espnus170612_article_070_01_04/4521004-1-eng-US/espnus170612_article_070_01_042.jpg\" width=\"848\" height=\"532\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"espnus170612_article_070_01_04\" title=\"espnus170612_article_070_01_04\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>In Barcelona, Hamilton relied on his Mercedes pit crew (top) to keep him up front and his bulldog Roscoe to keep him at ease.</b></p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>Those were the last days when life was normal. By age 13, Hamilton was part of McLaren’s young driver development program. At age 22, Hamilton started his first F1 race. He won four races as a rookie, finishing second overall, then followed that up with five more victories and his first championship in 2008.</p>\n<p>But inside he felt like a robot. Hamilton says McLaren and his father instructed him on everything from what to wear to what to say. He didn’t even have control of his own bank account. “I won races, but there was this chained kind of feeling. Like when you’re old enough to move out but you’re still living at home and feel stuck,” he says.</p>\n<p>That’s why he decided to leave McLaren and no longer work with his dad, a decision he says was one of the toughest of his life.</p>\n<p>“It was like my last step of independence as a man,” he says. “Mercedes wanted to grow. I was upfront with them: ‘This is who I am. This is who you are buying.’ And they already knew. They embraced it.”</p>\n<p><b>BY THURSDAY NIGHT,</b> three days before the Spanish Grand Prix, the hospitality suite has largely emptied save for Hamilton and his closest confidant, a bulldog named Roscoe. On the same hardwood floor where the chairman of Mercedes will stand in 48 hours, Roscoe chases an empty plastic water bottle, slamming into a row of chairs. Hamilton laughs. He owns two bulldogs, bringing them everywhere he can.</p>\n<p>“[The dogs] don’t care if I win or lose,” he says. “They are so pure. In my world, everyone always smiles. You don’t know who means it. You never wonder with them.”</p>\n<p>After a quiet dinner of grilled salmon, Hamilton pulls out his phone. When Hamilton’s hands aren’t wrapped around a steering wheel, they are almost always holding his phone. Hamilton points to his screen saver, a portrait of a beautiful woman.</p>\n<p>“This is my auntie,” Hamilton says. “She’s with me every day.”</p>\n<p>Hamilton explains that his aunt Diane died five years ago after a short battle with cancer. The day before she died, she told her nephew she couldn’t believe she had run out of time. There was so much more she wanted to do. “She asked me to promise her not to waste any time, to live every day like it could be your last. And I’ve taken that more than any lesson I’ve ever had,” he says.</p>\n<p>In Hamilton’s day job, his world flies by at 200 mph. As impossible as it might be, he tries to keep the same pace off the track. “No one gets to the end and wishes they had more money,” he says. “When my time comes, I want to say, ‘S---, I had a good life. I did everything I possibly could.’ That means, when I’m here, I want to go do s---.”</p>\n<p>That means dominating the track on Sundays, no matter who’s in the field. That means sandboarding in the United Arab Emirates or waging a tickle war with his niece and nephew. Or preening for the Met Gala. Hamilton says it’s business, but it looks fun. So why does the man who strives for a judgment-free life, who cherishes the unconditional companionship of dogs, regularly find himself in one of the most superficial places on earth: the red carpet?</p>\n<p>“I can’t say I really have friends there. I have people who I know, but could I call them if everything fell apart in this world? Hell no,” he says. “Not one single person who I think would be there for me. That’s my boys in the bobsled. That’s my family.”</p>\n<p>As Hamilton sees it, building relationships in the entertainment world sets the foundation for his life after racing, which he says will come in five to 10 years. He’s already recorded several hip-hop tracks that he hasn’t released publicly but has shared with close friends, as well as Drake, Kanye and Pharrell. The firm that handles his PR, Purple, also reps Adele and Alicia Keys.</p>\n<p>“I refuse to let this be the be-all and end-all of my life,” Hamilton says. “There is more for me. This is my side hobby. There are other things I’m great at and interested in. When I stop, it will just be the next chapter. But to do those things, I have to elevate myself beyond these walls. As excited as I am to race on Sundays and be in Formula One, I’m just as excited about what’s beyond.”</p>\n<p><b>BEFORE LEAVING HIS</b> RV to head for the track on race morning, Hamilton kneels down and rubs Roscoe on the muzzle. “I’ll see you later, buddy,” he says. Having won the Spanish GP pole by one-twentieth of a second a day earlier gives him a huge advantage at a track where it’s difficult to pass. But at the start of the race, Hamilton spins his tires. Before the first turn, Vettel’s red Ferrari slips past.</p>\n<p>After a tire change on Lap 38, Vettel exits the pits as Hamilton flies down the straightaway. Side by side, the two cars roar into the first turn, with both drivers refusing to give an inch. Hamilton’s silver Mercedes briefly slides off the track. The Ferrari garage erupts. But racing on softer, faster tires, Hamilton knows he has the advantage. For the next seven laps, Hamilton magnetizes his car to Vettel’s. On the first turn of Lap 44, Hamilton sees an opening. He cuts inside. There’s nothing the German can do. Hamilton takes the lead.</p>\n<p>For the next half hour, Hamilton’s crew sits in the garage, nervously monitoring everything from tire wear to engine temperature. It all looks perfect; Vettel never has a chance. Hamilton artfully paints his car around the sun-drenched track for the next 22 laps. He takes the checkered flag, his 55th Formula One win, second most all time behind Michael Schumacher’s 91. Hamilton parks his car and jumps off the front, pumping his fist. He runs to the stands, where German soccer star Mats Hummels, actor James Marsden and Marsden’s girlfriend, British singer Edei, are cheering. It’s a modest celeb turnout for Hamilton but to be expected with Monaco next on the calendar.</p>\n<p>For the next two and a half hours, Hamilton doesn’t stop. There are nearly 90 minutes of interviews, which don’t begin until Hamilton uses the mirror on his reflective sunglasses to make sure his hat is straight and his face is sweat-free. After a change of clothes, there are more photos and the customary champagne war with his team. Finally, he retreats to the Mercedes suite. Someone brings a tray filled with a special cocktail concoction—vodka and the new grape-flavored Monster energy drink Hamilton helped create. Marsden marvels at how masterfully the energy drink masks the vodka. Hamilton limits himself to a sip, but he too is blown away.</p>\n<p>“That’s crazy,” Hamilton says. “Seriously, how much vodka did you put in there? That could really f--- you up.”</p>\n<p>This is as crazy as the party gets. A day earlier, there were plans to go to London, New York for a day and then back to London before returning home to Monaco. But Hamilton is exhausted. He can’t remember the last time a race took this much out of him—he reportedly lost almost 5 pounds during the race. The man who swore his energy was endless has somehow emptied his tank. He just wants to go home, to his own couch, his own bed. Once there, he’ll take Roscoe for a walk on the beach. Order some carryout from his favorite sushi place. And pop in a movie.</p>\n<p>“There are no parties tonight,” he says. “This is it. I’m going home. I’m going to sleep for two days. And then it’s time to get ready for Monaco. Now that will be a party.”</p>\n","layout":{"landscape":{"id":"am-rs-landscape-2","link":"feature-l.twig"},"portrait":{"id":"am-rs-portrait-2","link":"feature.twig"}},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":1,"link_source":"","image":[{"id":"zinio_espnus170612_article_070_01_image_0_1496159865.2046","name":"espnus170612_article_070_01_01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_143/storage/images/media2/images/espnus170612_article_070_01_01/4521025-1-eng-US/espnus170612_article_070_01_012.jpg?t=story_img_size_768x0&ext/espnus170612_article_070_01_012_story_img_size_768x0.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"2261","height":"1559","legacy_id":"883140","is_default":true},{"id":"zinio_espnus170612_article_070_01_image_0_1496159865.2046","name":"espnus170612_article_070_01_01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_143/storage/images/media2/images/espnus170612_article_070_01_01/4521025-1-eng-US/espnus170612_article_070_01_012.jpg?t=story_img_size_768x0&ext/espnus170612_article_070_01_012_story_img_size_768x0.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"2261","height":"1559","legacy_id":"883140","is_default":false}],"related_objects":{"image":[{"id":"zinio_espnus170612_article_070_01_image_3_1496159863.4991","name":"espnus170612_article_070_01_04","source":"","caption":"<p><b>In Barcelona, Hamilton relied on his Mercedes pit crew (top) to keep him up front and his bulldog Roscoe to keep him at ease.</b></p>\n","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_143/storage/images/media2/images/espnus170612_article_070_01_04/4521004-1-eng-US/espnus170612_article_070_01_042.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"848","height":"532","legacy_id":"883137"},{"id":"zinio_espnus170612_article_070_01_image_3_1496159863.4991","name":"espnus170612_article_070_01_04","source":"","caption":"<p><b>In Barcelona, Hamilton relied on his Mercedes pit crew (top) to keep him up front and his bulldog Roscoe to keep him at ease.</b></p>\n","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_143/storage/images/media2/images/espnus170612_article_070_01_04/4521004-1-eng-US/espnus170612_article_070_01_042.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"848","height":"532","legacy_id":"883137"},{"id":"zinio_espnus170612_article_070_01_image_2_1496159864.0639","name":"espnus170612_article_070_01_03","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_143/storage/images/media2/images/espnus170612_article_070_01_03/4521011-1-eng-US/espnus170612_article_070_01_032.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"848","height":"530","legacy_id":"883138"},{"id":"zinio_espnus170612_article_070_01_image_2_1496159864.0639","name":"espnus170612_article_070_01_03","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_143/storage/images/media2/images/espnus170612_article_070_01_03/4521011-1-eng-US/espnus170612_article_070_01_032.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"848","height":"530","legacy_id":"883138"},{"id":"zinio_espnus170612_article_070_01_image_1_1496159864.569","name":"espnus170612_article_070_01_02","source":"","caption":"<p><b>Hamilton sees time off the track as key to his F1 success.
