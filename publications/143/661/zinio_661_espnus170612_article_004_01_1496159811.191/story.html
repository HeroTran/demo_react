    </div><p>When I told folks I was interviewing Ryan, the response was a unanimous, “Ugh, that guy?” Ryan, to his credit, was not surprised. He’s keenly aware of what people think of him—good, bad and ugly. Ryan says he first felt famous after his reality show aired and he was getting stopped for photos and autographs walking down the streets of New York. He felt similar exposure after the Rio Olympics, when “people were basically telling me to go die,” he recalls good-naturedly. He adds of the debacle: “I definitely learned a lot about myself, including that I needed to grow up. And I learned a lot about other people.” MORE ON PAGE 62</p>

    </div><h3><b>Senior writer Tom Junod on Muhammad Ali’s lasting imprint</b></h3><p>In early February, I visited a business in Louisville called Muldoon Memorials, which has been making gravestones since the 1850s and had made Muhammad Ali’s. I met Cullen McBroom, who told me that he was the one who had designed Ali’s gravestone. He says he had kept the design on his desk for years with the name left off so that nobody would know that Ali was contemplating his own mortality. I walked out of there certain that I would write the story of all the people who were intimately involved with laying The Greatest to rest. MORE ON PAGE 18</p>

    </div><h3><b>ESPN director of sports analytics Ben Alamar on the limits of fame</b></h3><p>At first, I was surprised to see that no MLB or NHL players made our World Fame 100 list. But the reasoning for their absence is simple: Baseball and hockey players are not international household names. As a result, these players lack global endorsement deals and the media coverage that would put them on the fame map. American sport fans may be shocked to see that Chinese badminton player Lin Dan made the list but that Bryce Harper is nowhere to be found. This list speaks volumes to the importance of international appeal and audience. MORE ON PAGE 34</p>

    </div><h3><b>Senior writer Kurt Streeter on Roger Federer’s tableside manner</b></h3><p>During my sit-down interview with Federer in Seattle, a waitress kept coming up to ask if there was anything we needed. Water? Food? Were we comfortable? Federer kept telling her “Thank you” very sincerely, each time looking straight into her eyes. He gave off no sense of privilege, no sense of dismissiveness. I took these moments as significant—I’ve seen many famous people operate quite differently, but Federer talked about how he views politeness as a grounding mechanism, a deeply ingrained part of his value system, his code.
