    </div><p>Major league baseball is in an era of enlightenment in which organizations are filled with the bright minds of men and women who won’t accept the status quo without examination. The phrase <i>That’s the way it’s always been done</i> is routinely ignored, and more informed decisions are now made about defensive positioning, pitch selection, bunts, platoons and trade value, as well as about whether it’s worth sacrificing an All-Star catcher to the act of blocking home plate just to prevent one run in one game in a 162-game season.</p>
<p>But as the sport has evolved, the practice of retaliation—through the use of a baseball thrown at a prone human target—is still in play, left over like a horse and buggy in the middle of an interstate highway. Take the Braves–Blue Jays series in mid-May, when Jose Bautista clubbed a home run with Toronto down 8-3 and flipped his bat with joy, momentarily glaring in the direction of Atlanta pitcher Eric O’Flaherty. Bautista’s emotional reactions can’t be a surprise to anyone who has watched him play during the past decade, yet before the next day’s game, it was determined by somebody that Bautista was going to get drilled. This might have been exacerbated by the Braves’ losing Freddie Freeman to a broken wrist on an Aaron Loup fastball in the series, but whatever the primary motivation, Julio Teheran threw his first pitch to Bautista inside at 95 mph. He hit him in the thigh with his second pitch at 96 mph—the fastest pitch thrown by Teheran to that point this season. Bautista said nothing, dropped his bat and went to first base.</p>
<p>A lot of Toronto runs followed. Three in the first and six more before Teheran’s three-plus-inning pitching line was completed. So what was the point of the retaliation?</p>
<p>Earl Weaver, a really smart manager who believed in statistics and reasoning, thought this through about half a century ago and decided his Orioles teams would not participate in the beanball thing. If you retaliate, he told his pitchers, one of our guys might get hurt, and our guys are better than their guys. According to ESPN Stats &amp; Information, from 1969 to 1982, Weaver’s first full 14 years as Orioles manager, Baltimore pitchers hit by far the fewest hitters of any staff in the AL (excluding the expansion Jays and Mariners, who played their first seasons in 1977). Baltimore played in the World Series four times and won more games than any other team in those 14 years, with a 1,306–885 record. So Baltimore was not hurt because the pitchers wouldn’t participate in the American League’s HBP wars, and it is possible Weaver’s strategy helped to keep Hall of Famers such as Brooks Robinson, Frank Robinson, Cal Ripken and Jim Palmer on the field.</p>
<p>There is no sound reasoning behind a pitcher intentionally hitting a fellow member of his union with a 96 mph fastball and placing that person’s body and career at heightened risk for serious injury. Yet MLB still fosters this antiquated practice. Earlier this season, Boston’s Chris Sale threw behind Baltimore’s Manny Machado, and everybody in uniform at Fenway Park that day knew it was probably on purpose, including the umpires. But Sale was not ejected; he was not suspended. Within the current culture of baseball, in the unwritten rules, there’s the Right Way to Retaliate and the Wrong Way to Retaliate, and by that measure, Sale was OK in the eyes of MLB law. Which is kind of dumb because if Sale hadn’t controlled the pitch the way he intended and had broken Machado’s jaw, Sale’s retaliation would’ve been deemed the Wrong Way to Retaliate.</p>
<p>In what other sport are game officials and league executives looking the other way on retaliation? If a defensive lineman goes down to a cut block in the NFL, referees aren’t giving his team one free shot at wrecking somebody’s knee. If an NBA player is hit with a flagrant-2, referees won’t look away if the other team retaliates with a flagrant-2 type of violation. Even in the NHL—a league of enforcers—an act of retaliation leads to a penalty, a game misconduct, a suspension.</p>
<p>But when Teheran intentionally fired a baseball into the leg of Bautista at 96 mph, you know what he got? A warning. Under the unwritten rules, the message to Teheran is that what he did is the Right Way to Retaliate. How crazy is that? How inane?</p>
<p>Earl Weaver was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1996, and he passed away four years ago. But hopefully the rest of baseball will catch up to him sometime in the next century.</p>
