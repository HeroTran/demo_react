    </div><p>Before opening Cherry Street Bar-B-Que last year, Toronto’s Lawrence La Pianta had been a barbecue hobbyist, smoking local rivals in cook-offs for 20 years. So we asked him to smell what’s cooking at Blue Jays games, where they sling the Hogtown Stak, an offering that pays homage to Toronto’s early history as a hub of pork processing.</p>
<p><b>How does this dish represent Toronto?</b></p>
<p>It’s got a strong Canadian influence. Ballparks all seem to have a signature dish, and that’s what I think the Jays did with this and its take on poutine with the pulled pork and the gravy.</p>
<p><b>This fits right in with the burgeoning barbecue scene in Toronto. How did this get started?</b></p>
<p>I think regardless of where you are, the Food Network sparked a frenzy for food in general. But Aaron Franklin [of Franklin Barbecue] in Austin has spawned a lot of places doing high-level barbecue. Now there are a few of us who have been cooking barbecue for a while up here who have places where people can come in, sit down and eat. Everybody is elevating the game.</p>
<p><b>How do you see this playing as ballpark food?</b></p>
<p>It’s such a big part of the experience. You’re going to indulge and make an event out of it. The food should be substantial and filling. You’re not going to eat that poutine dish at home—unless you’re on a mission.</p>
