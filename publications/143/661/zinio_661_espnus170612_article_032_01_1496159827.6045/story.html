    </div><p><b>When did working out become a big part of your life?</b></p>
<p>The initial desire to train at an elite level started when I was probably 12.</p>
<p><b>What are the big things you’ve learned from that many years of training?</b></p>
<p>Probably the most influential thing was in college, a guy named Zach Dechant—who is still the baseball strength coach at TCU—was all about training in ways that mimic the movements we do on the field. We would do a lot of T-spine [thoracic] mobility, a lot of hip mobility, basically warming up those joints before you’re about to put 400 to 500 pounds on a back squat. I started to develop a routine that allowed me to prepare myself to move heavy weight but also maximize my recovery time.</p>
<p><b>Do you still lift a lot?</b></p>
<p>It’s a combination of both. When I do train heavy, it’s typically one to two days a week, but the training I do just about on a daily basis is Pilates-based. Pilates allows me to prepare my body, whether I have to play long toss or I have a bullpen—whatever my duties are on the field, Pilates gets my body into a position where I’m activated, I’m loose and I’m ready to go as soon as I step on the field. I kind of brought Pilates to the Cubs. I told them: “This is our way to be innovative. In five to 10 years, every clubhouse in baseball is going to be doing this.”</p>
<p><b>How important is flexibility for a pitcher?</b></p>
<p>My flexibility is probably my No. 1 asset. Obviously we need to have a strong shoulder, strong scapula, strong lats and a durable elbow to have longevity as a pitcher, but being mobile in the hips and flexible in the hamstrings takes so much pressure and stress off of my arm.</p>
