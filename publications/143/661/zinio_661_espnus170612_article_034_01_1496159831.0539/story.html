<p><b>Who’s the world’s most famous athlete?</b> To settle that debate (for this year), we asked ESPN reporters from across six continents to identify the planet’s top active athletes, then had our director of sports analytics, Ben Alamar, run nearly 400 through a formula that factored in endorsements, social media following and Google search popularity. The result: the World Fame 100. X So what did we learn? That the world—the <i>entire</i> world, not just our neck of it—makes fame go around. Just ask an MLB or NHL player, none of whom made the cut, or Chinese table tennis player Ma Long, who did (No. 71). Or ask any of the 38 soccer players, who outnumbered all U.S. athletes on the list. Love the NFL? The world scoffs. Not only does top NFLer Tom Brady rank a mere 21st, there are more Brazilians here than football players. X Oh, and the last thing we learned: If you’re single-name famous (like Ronaldo, Federer or Serena), you’re probably so famous that we wrote a whole story on you too. Read on!</p>
