<p><b>SEVENTEEN STORIES ABOVE</b> Manhattan, on a deck flooded with champagne and beautiful people, Usain Bolt has nowhere to run.</p>
<p>He’s retreated to this quiet nook while hosting a Kentucky Derby party for one of his 16 corporate sponsors. In less than five minutes, the invitation-only crowd closes in, phones weaponized in a filming, tweeting, Snapchatting frenzy. Bolt, 30, turns up the wattage in his smile, his broad shoulders bobbing to the dancehall reggae. If not for his purple blazer over a brilliant white shirt, pants and sneakers, Bolt could easily be approaching the starting line at the Olympic Games.</p>
<p>In June, the eight-time Olympic gold medalist will start the final lap of his career with a race in his native Jamaica, running toward the 100 meters at the world championships in London in August. Why do it again? What’s left to chase for the world’s fastest man? The answer is in this rooftop crush.</p>
<p>“This season is just for the fans, really,” he says.</p>
<p>After London, there’ll still be plenty of adoring crowds as he transitions to global pitchman, philanthropist, professional partygoer. He’s even talked about trying pro soccer in Germany. Wherever he can find that jolt of adoration.</p>
<p>“As soon as you walk out and the crowd gives you that ‘Ohhhh!’” he says, “I’m like, ‘Yes!’”</p>
