<p><b>Junior is a NASCAR legend, a status built from his first full Cup season in 2000, when he won twice. He is equal parts performance, pedigree and personality, his star aided by his longtime relevance in pop culture. He’s attended award shows and even appeared in Jay Z’s “Show Me What You Got” music video in 2006. NASCAR will have a big void to fill when the 42-year-old retires after this season. —ANTHONY OLIVIERI</b></p>
