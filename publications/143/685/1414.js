That’s the question that inspired ESPN’s Béisbol Experience project, which gives voice to the Latinos who make up a record 26.4 percent of MLB’s rosters and to those trying to join them. Much unites these players—their passion, drive, love of the game—but their lives also contain multitudes. There’s the joy of a Dominican-American who plays with such flourish in Baltimore, and the heartbreak of a Cuban exile whose hope has been stranded halfway here. There’s the comfort that <i>pelota</i> brings to a Cuban-American household, and the loneliness that comes from chasing a dream thousands of miles from home. All season, Béisbol Experience has told these stories, in Spanish and English, across TV, radio, digital—and now in this issue. The stories continue through October—each one bringing the lives of Latino players to light.</p>\n<p><b>Béisbol Experience presents a weeklong flight of stories and specials June 19-25.

MAN, SUCH</b> a brutal game. Such a mean game. Sadistic, really, the way it runs itself up under your skin and makes you miserable. Hang around a baseball clubhouse and you’ll start to wonder why anyone plays the damned thing. Sometimes it seems everybody in the game wakes up each morning trying to decide whether to be angry or bitter. Fittingly, the ballplayer’s favorite word is <i>grind</i>, as if coursing through 162 games is the sporting equivalent of an 18th-century polar expedition. Even good moments are dismissed as untrustworthy, because if ballplayers know one thing about the grind—this joyless, painful six-month scrape of hard surface against hard surface—it is its infinite capacity to humble them.</p>\n<p>Maybe that’s why they work so hard to create the illusion of frivolity. The visiting clubhouse in Detroit, to take one example, has a table with cartons of Dubble Bubble (three flavors), trays of Jolly Ranchers and Life Savers and Big Red and Tootsie Pops and Blow Pops and three kinds of protein bars, twist-top dispensers of Gummi Bears, peanuts, caramels and Reese’s Pieces, buckets of sunflower seeds in three different-sized bags. This setup might just be a distraction, like the promise of a lollipop after shots at the pediatrician’s, but at least it makes the clubhouse <i>look</i> like a fun place.</p>\n<p>Occasionally, though, an anomaly walks through these doors, a man who plays this dirge of a game with happiness and sunshine, a man whose smile doesn’t just appear—and appear frequently—but <i>erupts</i>. He patrols a vast area around third base, a kinetic wonderland bordered (roughly) by second base, left field and home plate. Under his jersey he wears a T-shirt with the words “Put an accent on it!” in Spanish. Manny Machado is many things, but joyless is not among them. Hell, even his name, with its consonants arranged like an enunciation exercise, sounds fun.</p>\n<p>He is both star and symbol, a 24-year-old Dominican-American from Miami who straddles two cultures and resides in a third. The game is changing—or, perhaps more accurately, <i>being changed</i>. Gradually and grudgingly, baseball’s culture is dismissing the mores of its pastoral grandparents. The game’s young stars, its Bryants and Lindors and Harpers and Arenados and even its overly inhibited Trout, bring a buoyancy to the game that is eroding the tsk-tsk repression that frowns upon public displays of happiness and inflates those who make playing the game look as difficult as possible.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_143/storage/images/media2/images/espnus170626_article_030_01_03/4527559-1-eng-US/espnus170626_article_030_01_032.jpg\" width=\"555\" height=\"953\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"espnus170626_article_030_01_03\" title=\"espnus170626_article_030_01_03\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n <span class=\"credit\">\nJOE ROBBINS/GETTY IMAGES</span></figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>“We think of it as out with the old and in with the new,” Machado says. “We just like to have fun and go out there and enjoy ourselves. Always a smile on our faces, just playing the game that we love.”</p>\n<p>Machado moves with a sprawling looseness that flirts with elegance. His endless limbs and their unusual liquidity have spawned tales—possibly apocryphal—about their composition. He has had identical surgeries on each knee, one in 2013 and another in 2014, and Orioles manager Buck Showalter says, “They were so loose, they needed to be tacked up, so it was a good thing for us that he got both of them fixed when he was young.” That would also mean Machado’s looseness is physiological as well as stylistic.</p>\n<p>“The way he plays … not with a chip on his shoulder, that’s not him, but with a swag that Miami boys got,” Orioles center fielder Adam Jones says. “You look at him, you know he’s a Miami guy.”</p>\n<p>Machado spends his downtime on the field canvassing the stands, as if each of those faces holds important information. He must lead the league in tossing baseballs to fans. He greets every runner who reaches third, and some who don’t, by slapping his glove across the player’s back. He talks to umpires and catchers and anyone who will listen in two languages.</p>\n<p>Machado and second baseman Jonathan Schoop have been friends since they started in the minors together in 2010, and both independently point out the photo hanging in the training room showing them celebrating their 2011 championship at Single-A Frederick. They argue about everything—chess, video games, fielding, hitting. Some days they classify themselves as friends, other days teammates. It’s a running joke; a friend is someone you talk with about everything, including personal stuff, while a teammate is someone with whom you play baseball. It’s unclear where these lines are, and when they’re drawn.</p>\n<p>“Sometimes he doesn’t like me telling him the truth,” Schoop says on a spring day that Machado would like everyone to know, for unspecified reasons, is a Teammate Day. “That’s why we fight a lot. Every day there’s something to fight about. We’ll fight today, and in two minutes we’ll be good.”</p>\n<p>Earlier that day, sitting in the dugout four hours before the game, Machado is joined by catcher Welington Castillo. “<i>El Neee-nyo</i>,” Machado says to the teammate he first met while playing for the Dominican team in this year’s World Baseball Classic. “This is my boy right here. He’s the truth, keeps me humble.”</p>\n<p>“Is that a hard job?” I ask Castillo.</p>\n<p>“A little bit,” he says, laughing.</p>\n<p>All of which is to say: Machado does not, by any rational definition, appear to grind. This is tricky territory. Mention this to one of his teammates and said teammate will look at you with an expression emanating disgust. Oh, he will tell you with the tone of a great oracle, Machado <i>does</i> grind, and to suggest otherwise—to suggest that he plays the game with an unworried joy that inoculates him from the game’s dour rigors—is to commit a brand of blasphemy that defies absolution. I try to ask Jones, another man who seems to have a monogamous relationship with joy, to explain Machado’s ability to make an excruciating game look fun, and the best I can do is to say, “Do you think he plays the game with an ease that can make people …”</p>\n<p>“Get jealous?” Jones interrupts. “Yeah, he plays with an ease that will make people jealous. When he’s making plays, it looks carefree. When he makes an error, if someone sees that same carefree attitude, they’ll think he’s not caring. But just 10 minutes before, they saw a play that nobody has made in a long time. Some guys just have to work harder for the simpler things, but not him.”</p>\n<p>Machado grinds, make no mistake. He’ll tell you he grinds because grinding is a given. You grind every game, every at-bat, every pitch. You grind or get ground, simple as that. Even if it’s a fun grind, it’s still a grind, and sometimes having fun carries a price.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_143/storage/images/media2/images/espnus170626_article_030_01_04/4527552-1-eng-US/espnus170626_article_030_01_042.jpg\" width=\"1367\" height=\"1084\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"espnus170626_article_030_01_04\" title=\"espnus170626_article_030_01_04\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n <span class=\"credit\">\nBLAZER BY MARC JACOBS; VINTAGE T-SHIRT; WATCH BY PATEK PHILIPPE; BRACELET BY CARTIER</span></figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p class=\"pullQuote\">\n<b>“HE PLAYS WITH A SWAG THAT THOSE MIAMI BOYS GOT. YOU LOOK AT HIM, YOU KNOW HE’S A MIAMI GUY.”</b><br /><b>CENTER FIELDER ADAM JONES</b></p>\n<p><b>BUCK SHOWALTER SITS</b> at his desk in Camden Yards looking severely perplexed. He has managed Machado since the third baseman arrived in an Orioles uniform nearly five years ago as a 20-year-old whose future was expected to determine whatever the franchise would become. He is protective of Machado; two years ago, he took the extraordinary step of visiting the general manager of the condominium complex where Mach-ado lived with his wife, Yainee, after he heard that a neighbor had been harassing Yainee when Manny was out of town. “This is important for the city of Baltimore,” Showalter told him. The neighbor stood down.</p>\n<p>He is a patient man, Showalter, and he speaks of the world as someone who has seen just about everything and kept most of it to himself. But on the topic of Machado he has no patience. “He’s the kind of kid you’d want to see walking through the front door with your daughter,” Showalter says. He shakes his head slowly and winces. “Some people have a problem with him, but I don’t get it. Is it because he makes everything look easy? He’s got a little flair to his game, and these guys don’t want to hear someone saying, ‘This isn’t the way we did it back in the day.’ He brings something to the game, and there are people who would like to put a thumb on him. You want everyone to be the same? How boring.”</p>\n<p>A life is presented in pieces, and the first story Machado tells about his decidedly nonboring life sounds kind of … boring. It’s about a fence. By the time he was 5, the game had already crawled up inside him. Every day after school in Hialeah, Florida, Manny spent hours throwing a tennis ball against a wall outside the house he shared with his mother, older sister and his Dominican-born grandfather. He would rob fictitious home runs at the gate on the side of the garage. Around 4:30 every day, he would walk across the street to his aunt and uncle’s house to wait for Geovanny Brito to pull into the driveway after work. Whenever Uncle Gio got home, almost always between 5 and 5:30, he couldn’t get both feet out of his car before he was being handed his glove and greeted with the words, “Here you go, boss. Let’s go get it.”</p>\n<p>By the time Manny turned 9, he and Uncle Gio would walk to a neighborhood field where Machado stood with his back to the outfield fence while his uncle hit him line drives and grounders. “Bullets from 10 feet away,” Machado says, shaking his head. Every day, Manny returned to the driveway, bringing with him two gloves, more bruises and quicker hands.</p>\n<p>“That’s how you get better,” Machado says. “Don’t let the ball hit you. Catch it or get out of the way. And if you get out of the way, that’s when you have to stop playing. So you’ve <i>got</i> to stay in there.”</p>\n<p>He grew up in a Latin neighborhood, with Latin friends, and his first team, in what he calls a low-budget travel ball, played together for several years while wearing T-shirts with a number on the back and “Chiefs” on the front (“probably 20 of ’em for $100,” Manny says) and plain white baseball pants (“from Sports Authority”).</p>\n<p>“We thought we were big leaguers with our Big League Chew gum, the eyeblackwe had flair,” Machado says. “We liked to show emotion, and a lot of people didn’t like that. We were mostly Latin, speaking to our parents in Spanish and our teammates in English. Our parents got into fights a bunch of times. Brawls. There were some good ones, some <i>real</i> good ones. Well, bad ones, actually. I remember there were a lot of bats involved. A lot of blood. It was bad.”</p>\n<p>He tells these stories to ground himself, and to remember, and it seems he tells this particular story so that he can say: “We always got along with the kids from the other side. After the games, we’d play two-on-two baseball or basketball while the adults were getting after it. That’s what I remember.”</p>\n<p>By the time Machado got to high school in 2006, he was compared with another famous Dominican-Miamian, Alex Rodriguez. Partly because of this reputation, Machado began working out at 17 with University of Miami players, including Yonder Alonso, whose sister, Yainee, would eventually become Machado’s wife.</p>\n<p>“The first time I met him he was super skinny, lanky and soft,” says Alonso, now with the A’s. “I thought, ‘He needs to eat and work out.’” In November, Alonso says, Machado couldn’t jump high enough to slap the backboard on a layup. By February, he was dunking. In June, Baltimore chose him with the third pick of the 2010 draft.</p>\n<p>Machado would be the next great Orioles shortstop, except that, in 2012, the Orioles needed a third baseman, at least one better than Wilson Betemit, who had 15 errors in 102 games. In Machado’s second full season in the minors, at Double-A, roving instructor Bobby Dickerson embarked on a special-ops mission. His goal: to make Machado a third baseman without letting anyone, not even Machado, know it was happening. Dickerson found creative ways to get Mach-ado to arrive at the park early. “Can you play a man’s position?” was one of his more successful lines. Secret intact, Dickerson drove home from Aberdeen, Maryland, and called Showalter. “He’s better than anything you have up there right now,” he said, “and he’s only been working there two weeks.”</p>\n<p>If anything, the projection was understated. Machado recorded 1.6 WAR in 51 games that first year in 2012, double the 0.8 Betemit had earned in 102 games. He’s finished in the top five in AL MVP voting the past two seasons, hitting 35 and 37 homers and finishing with a 7.1 and 6.7 WAR. All of which has inspired a different sort of projection: how big his contract will be when he becomes a free agent after the 2018 season. He will almost certainly approach—or even top—$400 million.</p>\n<p>He doesn’t so much seek attention as demand it. His turbulent swing unfurls like a bedsheet, starting near his right ear and reaching its conclusion somewhere near the backstop. By the time it finishes its swoop, you’d swear the 34½-inch bat is 6 feet long. But the true Machado flair takes place in the field. The way he situates his body while determining the path of the ball and the arc of the hop is something that approaches art. Machado won the American League Platinum Glove award in 2013, signifying the best defensive player in the league, and in Baltimore, where Brooks Robinson is one of the most beloved players of all time, it’s no longer heresy to suggest the kid with his back to the fence has grown up to be the best defensive third baseman in baseball history.</p>\n<p>“Whoever taught him to field a ground ball—kudos to him,” Jones says. “Come teach <i>my</i> kids.”</p>\n<p>There’s a risk to attributing personality traits and athletic qualities to cultural forces, but Machado’s ease and lack of self-consciousness are things that he himself associates with growing up playing in the Latin culture. Deeply rooted as he is in Miami, he nevertheless defines himself as a Latin player and says he “100 percent” identifies more with Latin teammates and opponents. “I talk to everyone, but most of the people I hang out with are Latin,” he says. “We all mostly stick together.” The fraternity is strong. On the first day of his first road trip as an Oriole, a Rangers clubhouse attendant handed him a plate of Latin food. “Nelson Cruz sent this over,” he said. It happened the next day, and the day after that.</p>\n<p>That bond, and a desire to honor his family’s heritage and the memory of his late grandfather, led to his decision to play for the D.R. in the World Baseball Classic in March. He saw it as an opportunity to learn more about his culture and play in the expressive, celebratory and nonjudgmental way he remembered as a child. “We were out there celebrating like Little League,” Machado says. “People hate us sometimes because we just like to have fun, no matter what. We lose—we’re having fun. We’re not going to change. The younger generation, that’s how we play. If we’re going to suck, we’re going to suck, but we’re going to go down how we do it. We’re always the same, no matter what.”</p>\n<p><b>NOW IS PROBABLY</b> the appropriate time to drag the river of Machado’s past indiscretions. He has run afoul of several provisions of baseball’s nebulous code: slow home run trots, bad body language, other real and perceived misdemeanors pertaining to vague and little-known citations. Baseball’s capacity for umbrage, 150 years in, retains the ability to surprise.</p>\n<p>Any transgression, either of omission or commission, will forever conjure memories of a meltdown three years ago in a series against Oakland, when Machado took offense to an allegedly hard tag by Josh Donaldson and launched a red-ass (in baseball’s technical vernacular) routine that included hitting catcher Derek Norris with two back-swings and, after nearly being hit by a pitch twice, throwing his bat toward third baseman Alberto Callaspo.</p>\n<p>“There were some things early in his career that I’m sure he’s not proud of,” says Dickerson, now the Orioles’ third-base coach. “Being close to him, I’m not proud of them. I know he’s learned from them. The Donaldson thing was one, and how to address it and own up to your mistakes.”</p>\n<p>During an April game this season, Show-alter, head down, hands in his jacket pockets, walked to the mound to make a pitching change after a botched bunt coverage. When he got there, he looked up and asked, “What happened with that bunt coverage?”</p>\n<p>Before Showalter could even finish, Mach-ado said, “I f---ed it up. I f---ed it up, but I got you. It won’t happen again.” The boil reduced to a simmer, Showalter had a moment of indecision. “I stood there,” he says, “thinking, ‘I guess I’m supposed to be mad.’”</p>\n<p>As Machado has matured, baseball too has shifted—slowly, yes, but undoubtedly in favor of those like Machado, who would rather celebrate than grumble. Both changes came into sharp display on April 21, when Machado slid high and late into Red Sox second baseman Dustin Pedroia, who had to leave the game and miss three more with a knee injury. Machado endured one of the lengthier and most unpredictable hunts for justice in recent memory—a two-week, two-city, mid-Atlantic display of vigilantism so convoluted the combatants themselves might have forgotten its origins.</p>\n<p>After Chris Sale, in game five of the ordeal, became the second Red Sox pitcher to barely miss Machado’s knees, with a 98 mph fastball (the <i>fifth</i> ball of 90-plus mph that Machado had dodged since the slide), Showalter called Machado into the runway that connects the Orioles’ dugout to the clubhouse.</p>\n<p>“I’m thinking of taking you out of the game,” Showalter said. “The umpires won’t protect you. The other team isn’t concerned about your safety. Convince me to keep you in the game, because if you can’t, I’m taking you out. Make me believe you.”</p>\n<p>“I got it,” Machado said.</p>\n<p>“That’s not good enough, Manny. If you get suspended, it hurts our club. If you give in, they win.”</p>\n<p>“No, really,” Machado said. “I got it. I’m cool.”</p>\n<p>Machado paused, looked at Showalter and said, “But if it happens again …”</p>\n<p>“If it happens again,” Showalter said, “you’re going to have to beat me out there, because we’re <i>all</i> coming.”</p>\n<p>Three weeks later, none of Machado’s teammates wants to talk about the Red Sox, and neither does he. What’s left to say? Besides, he’s in a tough spot: being asked to explain something without knowing how the explanation will come across, or how the people who carry the code in its golden coffer will respond to his explanation. But the aftermath is important. Machado, who exposed one more aspect of the archaic and empty code, became a sympathetic figure. The Red Sox’s response to Machado’s alleged crime was so farcical it became indefensible.</p>\n<p>“You get one shot,” Machado says. “One shot. That’s what you get. You don’t get to keep going and keep head-hunting. I get the situation. I get that Pedroia is the best player on the team, and I get that you have to hit me. That’s fine. Just hit me, get it over with, hit me in the right spot and I’m going to first base and we’ll continue to play baseball.”</p>\n<p>Fake drama, Showalter says. A pitcher comes inside with an off-speed pitch and the fans respond in a way that makes the hitter feel like he should be angry, and one of his pitchers might decide to retaliate. He equates it to a patient being asked “Does this hurt?” so many times by a doctor that he finally says, “Well, I guess so.”</p>\n<p>“I got a question for all those guys,” he says. “How manly do you feel when you’re standing on the mound and someone’s lying in the batter’s box with blood coming out of his ears?”</p>\n<p class=\"pullQuote\">\n<b>“YOU KNOW THE SAYING ‘DON’T TRY THIS AT HOME’? THAT’S MANNY. WHAT HE DOES ON THE FIELD, DON’T TRY THAT AT HOME.”</b><br /><b>MANAGER BUCK SHOWALTER</b></p>\n<p><b>HE SCRATCHES HIS</b> grandfather’s initials in front of third base, like an artist signing his work. <i>FN</i>, for Francisco Nunez, who died in 2009 before he could see his grandson join a generation of ballplayers that just might change the game. What Nunez would have learned about his grandson is that his art is purely expressionist and that the brain is simply not fast enough to keep up. Watch enough baseball and certain projections seep into your consciousness, including one that says a ball that ricochets off a piece of hard maple at more than 100 mph and skips once down the line before reaching third base is a double into the corner.</p>\n<p>And yet Machado fielded that exact ball off the bat of Toronto’s Russell Martin in late May. He dove to his backhand side and spun his body, sliding as if on ice, to face right field and fire the ball to second base and start a double play. How do you describe it? Maybe this way: He’s surfing the dirt. He’s the world’s foremost dirt surfer. It was precisely the kind of play that caused Showalter, at the beginning of spring training, to tell new pitching coach Roger McDowell, “You just let me know when you’ve seen something you’ve never seen before.” Peeking his head down an imaginary bench in an imaginary dugout, Showalter re-enacts McDowell’s reaction after just a few weeks of watching Machado play. He shoots one finger in front of him—that’s one, he says. Another finger—that’s two. Another—that’s three.</p>\n<p>“You know the saying ‘Don’t try this at home’?” Showalter asks. “That’s Manny. What he does on the field, don’t try that at home.”</p>\n<p>But on a Wednesday night in mid-May, the game’s sadistic forces are winning. The grievous consequences of playing the game are almost too much to bear. The expedition has reached crisis level: food gone, nothing left to burn. The game ends with Machado rung up unjustly on a checked swing. The Orioles lose, the tying run stranded. Everyone is weak, clutching photos of loved ones.</p>\n<p>The loss comes amid a terrible stretch for the Orioles (seven straight losses, 13 of 16) and an even worse one for Machado, who is staggering through a slump that will drag his average down to .205 at the end of May. It comes about two weeks after Dickerson sat down with Machado and told him, “The definition of who you are is what it looks like when you’re at your worst.”</p>\n<p>The clubhouse is nearly empty. Machado is walking around his locker, the game still inside him, when pitcher Wade Miley bounces over, holding an iPad.</p>\n<p>“You didn’t go,” he tells Machado. “Check this out.”</p>\n<p>Machado stops pacing.</p>\n<p>“I don’t want to make you mad, bro,” Miley says.</p>\n<p>“I’m already mad,” Machado says.</p>\n<p>Machado is smiling, though—that eruption again. This is what Alonso, his brother-in-law, means when he says, “Manny can let it go, man.” The strikeout seems a lifetime ago, and Machado shares a laugh with Miley before the pitcher walks away, slightly confounded. It’s a small moment, unnoticed amid the interminable misery of the eternal grind. He knows there will be bruises and doubters and those who feel the game should be policed by an ancient code that is both inviolable and permanent. But there will always be the smile, and the confidence, and the quiet moment to say a prayer and etch those initials in the hallowed ground. And there will always be another day to represent a culture—We’re <i>always the same, no matter</i> what—that demands that joy be more than an illusion.</p>\n<h5><b>GAME BIRDS</b></h5>\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_143/storage/images/media2/images/espnus170626_article_030_01_05/4527545-1-eng-US/espnus170626_article_030_01_052.jpg\" width=\"868\" height=\"460\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"espnus170626_article_030_01_05\" title=\"espnus170626_article_030_01_05\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p><b>Manny Machado ranks first in Orioles history for runs created through an age-23 season, easily outdistancing Hall of Famers Cal Ripken and Eddie Murray.</b></p>\n<h3><b>ELITE COMPANY</b></h3><p><b>In his ages 19-23 seasons, Machado recorded 10.2 dWAR, nearly six runs better than Orioles hero Brooks Robinson’s total over the same time.</b></p>\n","layout":{"landscape":{"id":"am-rs-landscape-3","link":"feature_02-l.twig"},"portrait":{"id":"am-rs-portrait-3","link":"feature_02.twig"}},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":1,"link_source":"","image":[{"id":"zinio_espnus170626_article_030_01_image_0_1497518536.1718","name":"espnus170626_article_030_01_01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_143/storage/images/media2/images/espnus170626_article_030_01_01/4527573-1-eng-US/espnus170626_article_030_01_012.jpg?t=story_img_size_768x0&ext/espnus170626_article_030_01_012_story_img_size_768x0.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"1871","height":"1799","legacy_id":"884375","is_default":true},{"id":"zinio_espnus170626_article_030_01_image_0_1497518536.1718","name":"espnus170626_article_030_01_01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_143/storage/images/media2/images/espnus170626_article_030_01_01/4527573-1-eng-US/espnus170626_article_030_01_012.jpg?t=story_img_size_768x0&ext/espnus170626_article_030_01_012_story_img_size_768x0.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"1871","height":"1799","legacy_id":"884375","is_default":false}],"related_objects":{"image":[{"id":"zinio_espnus170626_article_030_01_image_4_1497518533.4288","name":"espnus170626_article_030_01_05","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_143/storage/images/media2/images/espnus170626_article_030_01_05/4527545-1-eng-US/espnus170626_article_030_01_052.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"868","height":"460","legacy_id":"884371"},{"id":"zinio_espnus170626_article_030_01_image_4_1497518533.4288","name":"espnus170626_article_030_01_05","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_143/storage/images/media2/images/espnus170626_article_030_01_05/4527545-1-eng-US/espnus170626_article_030_01_052.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"868","height":"460","legacy_id":"884371"},{"id":"zinio_espnus170626_article_030_01_image_3_1497518534.1026","name":"espnus170626_article_030_01_04","source":"BLAZER BY MARC JACOBS;

If the Cuban government doesn’t like the way you act or the way you think, it doesn’t matter how much talent you have.

I was never afraid that people would make fun of me when I said a wrong word.”</p>\n<p><b>ADRIÁN BELTRÉ</b></p>\n<p>“I tried to learn a new word every day at the stadium, things like dirt, grass, screen, objects in the dugout, chewing gum.

We started by ordering food at McDonald’s or at Subway after the game. What helped me was pointing at a photo [of food], saying something as if I were murmuring, letting them answer me and saying ‘yes.’ But I didn’t know what they were going to give me. Whatever came, I tried to eat it. I went hungry a lot because I’ve always hated pickles. A lot of times the food at McDonald’s came with a lot of pickles, and when I ordered I’d grab the food, go to the hotel, sit down to eat and open it to find pickles. I’d immediately throw it in the trash.”</p>\n<p><b>ADRIÁN BELTRÉ</b></p>\n<p>“I used to go to the same place, Denny’s, because they had menus with pictures. I would point at what I wanted to eat. That was my spot. They had breakfast, they had lunch ... whatever you want.”</p>\n<p><b>CARLOS GONZÁLEZ</b></p>\n<p>“When you wanted to eat something, you had to wait for someone who spoke English. I’d sit in my locker until someone came who could go out and eat with me.”</p>\n<p><b>HANLEY RAMÍREZ</b></p>\n<p>“The first thing you learn how to say is ‘the same,’ so you would order the same thing your teammate asks for because that’s the only thing you know.”</p>\n<p><b>EDWIN ENCARNACIÓN</b></p>\n<p>“At McDonald’s, I said that I wanted to eat the same thing, without knowing what it was. Afterwards, I learned the words ‘I want,’ so I could say ‘I want the same thing.’”</p>\n<p><b>CARLOS SANTANA, INDIANS, DOMINICAN REPUBLIC</b></p>\n<p>“It’s no secret that after eating in restaurants for two weeks straight, food just does not taste the same. But then I simply had to expand my palate.

To help each other, let’s say we were six or eight Latinos, we collected our money and we bought groceries collectively. We got chicken and rice. We had an electric skillet for rice, and we had a pan for the meat. It was forbidden to cook inside the hotel, so we had to avoid having the smoke from our cooking get to the smoke detectors.

You see a lot of issues with guys like [Yoenis] Céspedes or Puig, when they’re celebrating. However, that’s the only way they know, and I get it. Everyone comes from different situations, so you have to be open-minded, you’ve got to understand why they do that kind of stuff. You can’t just judge people because of the way they play.”</p>\n<p><b>CARLOS GONZÁLEZ</b></p>\n<p>“It’s one thing to celebrate, another to not respect the opponent. I think there are many ways to celebrate and express your emotions without disrespecting the opposite team or baseball or a culture that isn’t accustomed to that. Today you see many things you didn’t see before thanks to social media. Before, they celebrated the same way and immediately received a message from a veteran telling you not to do it so much and that one has to earn that, to earn enough respect to celebrate without offending anyone. But today it’s another baseball. People have to understand we’re living in another era. Today there are many young players who want to stand out and to celebrate.”</p>\n<p><b>MIGUEL CABRERA</b></p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_143/storage/images/media2/images/espnus170626_article_040_01_08/4527639-1-eng-US/espnus170626_article_040_01_082.jpg\" width=\"1187\" height=\"877\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"espnus170626_article_040_01_08\" title=\"espnus170626_article_040_01_08\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n <span class=\"credit\">\nMATT BROWN/ANGELS BASEBALL LP/GETTY IMAGES</span></figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p class=\"pullQuote\">\n“You feel proud of being able to come from a country where you had nothing and then come here and be able to make your dreams come true.”<br /><b>ROBINSON CANÓ, MARINERS, DOMINICAN REPUBLIC</b></p>\n<h3><b>IDENTIDAD</b></h3><p><b>The issues closest to home.</b></p>\n<p>“In Venezuela, baseball is a source of joy for the country right now because of all that is happening [politically].

This one-chair joint, run by Hugo “Juice” Tandron, is strictly a players-only experience. With the late José Fernández’s No. 16 on his vest, Juice opens his doors for nearly every home game and takes only what he is offered. “As little as $5 and as much as $10,000,” he says. (And, oh, Dontrelle Willis once gave him a ’74 Chevy Caprice convertible.) Visiting players sit down too: Bryce Harper swears by him, Mike Trout came by, and others fly him to their cities for cuts.

Today, in the Dominican Republic, he has yet to find them.</b></p>\n <span class=\"credit\">\nPHOTOGRAPHS BY LISETTE POOLE</span></figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p><b>ON THE AFTERNOON</b> of April 28, 2014, Lerys Aguilera stepped out of his house in Holguín, a provincial capital in Cuba’s rustic eastern half. He hadn’t gone far when he felt a tap on his shoulder. He turned and faced a young man, a stranger, who looked to be in his early 30s. In Holguín, Lerys Aguilera was famous. For the prior 11 seasons he’d played first base and hit cleanup for the Holguín Sabuesos, one of 16 teams in the National Series, Cuba’s <i>grandes ligas</i>. He was 6-foot-1 and almost 300 pounds; he was a slugger, a reliable home run hitter, with a career batting average of .270. The man who tapped him on the shoulder knew all this and said so. He also knew other parts of Aguilera’s biography—namely, that the ballplayer had fallen in love with a Dominican woman who’d come to Cuba to study medicine, that the two had married and that not long ago his wife’s visa had expired, forcing her back to her home country.</p>\n<p>The man’s pitch was succinct: <i>Let us take you to the Dominican Republic for free. You reunite with your wife, and we’ll help you pursue a baseball career in America.</i> Aguilera had already researched ways to get to the Dominican Republic legally on his own. But the expense of a Dominican visa plus a plane ticket was far beyond his means, exponentially more than his annual governmental stipend as a Cuban baseball player. If Aguilera wished to take this opportunity, the man told him, he should walk outside his door at exactly 3 p.m. two days from now. The man would be waiting.</p>\n<p>For two nights, Aguilera did not sleep. For two nights, he prayed. At the appointed hour, he stood up from his kitchen table and, saying nothing to his family—not his father, mother, brother or grandmother—he walked out of the house and into a van. He had no idea where <i>they</i> were taking him; he had no idea who they were. His guides dispensed almost no information. It occurred to him then, his throat tightening, that he was no longer in control of anything at all. He had put himself totally at the mercy of smugglers.</p>\n<p>After a six-hour drive to a remote and windblown strand, after wading out in the middle of the night to a small twin-engine fiberglass fishing boat operated by two Haitians whose heads were sheathed in balaclavas, after an 18-hour voyage on heavy seas to the town of Cap-Haïtien on the north coast of Haiti, after a jouncing ride in an SUV on rutted tracks through sugarcane fields, after fording the mouth of the Massacre River on a dinghy poled by a ferryman, after a bus ride and a handoff and another hourslong car drive, after being deposited in a hostel in the small town of Cotuí in the Dominican interior … after all that, Aguilera was not immediately reunited with his wife. It was hard to figure out what was going on; he didn’t then have his own phone. Almost a week passed before he was finally brought to her—she lived in a town only an hour’s drive away—but the reunion was sweet. “It was an almost endless hug,” Aguilera says now.</p>\n<p>Little did he know then, but Aguilera would pay a great toll for that hug. He had joined the ranks of Cuba’s baseball diaspora—a lost tribe of baseball prospects that grows larger and more desperate by the day.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_143/storage/images/media2/images/espnus170626_article_056_01_02/4527778-1-eng-US/espnus170626_article_056_01_022.jpg\" width=\"1301\" height=\"878\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"espnus170626_article_056_01_02\" title=\"espnus170626_article_056_01_02\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>Bartolomé, 32, is past his prime.

An eight-year starter at first base for the Camagüey Alfareros, he had already seen dozens of his player friends leave Cuba and sign with MLB teams. His plane ticket was paid for by a man in the Dominican Republic whose name Bartolomé was afraid to say. A little more than a year after catching his flight, Bartolomé, unsigned and abandoned by his sponsors, was living in a rural hamlet, penniless and bedridden. He had dengue fever.</p>\n<p>Jorge Hernandez, a sidearm pitcher from Cienfuegos and former National Series teammate of Yasiel Puig and José Abreu, left Cuba by commercial air in 2014 and says he was almost abducted by an SUV full of men not long after he arrived in the D.R. There was a car chase through the streets of San Francisco de Macorís; gunshots were fired. A group of rival smugglers, Hernandez was later told, had sent the would-be kidnappers to get him.</p>\n<p>Pavel Quesada, another Cienfuegan, spent many months in the Dominican Republic trying out for MLB teams; his agents told him there were no takers. Desperate for an opportunity to play anywhere at all, he got himself smuggled to Venezuela. There, amid riots and food shortages, he was going to try out for the Venezuelan league.</p>\n<p>Lisban Correa, late of Havana’s famed Industriales, was brought out of Cuba by plane to Haiti in July 2015. Over the years, he’d been approached several times. He’d heard smugglers say: <i>The Colorado Rockies already have a deal in place for you. They sent us here to get you!</i> He’d heard smugglers say: <i>The moment you touch down on Dominican soil, you’ll get $2 million, $4 million, $6 million</i>. But when he arrived in Port-au-Prince, his investor had bailed. He was stuck in Haiti, a man without a country.</p>\n<p>Yandy Suarez was smuggled by boat out of Cuba to the Dominican Republic in 2016. Just 20 at the time, the pitcher had played two seasons in the National Series for his hometown squad, Los Tigres de Ciego de Avila. The smugglers claimed they had their own private baseball academy. “They were lying,” Suarez says. There was only a stable of five other Cubans stashed in the same hotel. Armed security guards surrounded the group at all times. Were the guards meant to protect the players or to prevent them from escaping? “Probably both,” he says.</p>\n<p><b>ALL OF THESE</b> players are part of an unprecedented athlete exodus out of Cuba—since 2014, some 349 <i>peloteros</i>, or ballplayers, have emigrated off the island. If you haven’t heard of it, it is because you’re not meant to: They’re invisible by design and rendered powerless by their reality.</p>\n<p>In April 2016, a young Cuban journalist and baseball fanatic named Francis Romero decamped from his native island for reasons that parallel those of the athletes he writes about. “I wanted to get to the next level,” he says. He wanted, in other words, to write about baseball free of the restrictions placed on Cuban journalists by their government. Now 30, Romero has made it his life’s work to track Cuba’s ballplayer migration. That number—349 émigrés in three-plus years—comes from his research. There were 54 in 2014; a veritable explosion in 2015, when 184 players left; and more than 100 since. Almost 10 players per month are fleeing the island. More players have left Cuba since 2014 than in all the other years under the Castros—over half a century—combined.</p>\n<p>It might seem intuitive that this mass migration was unleashed by the diplomatic thaw between Cuba and the Barack Obama administration, announced in December 2014. But that’s not the case. The U.S. trade embargo, which remains in place and can be removed only by an act of Congress, still makes it impossible for MLB teams to sign contracts with Cuban ballplayers who remain resident in Cuba.</p>\n<p>Instead, the exodus can best be explained by baseball’s cyclical economics. Among MLB’s scouts and back-office executives, it is referred to as the “Cuban market,” and since 2009 that market has undergone a boom. A sequence of Cuban baseball virtuosos—Aroldis Chapman, Yoenis Céspedes, Puig, Abreu—have fetched ever-larger eight-digit contracts. With the exception of Chapman, all were smuggled out of Cuba. And all those deals and more (scores of Cubans have signed seven-figure deals) have made the smugglers rich. The key loophole they have exploited is well-known: By “establishing residency” in a country other than Canada or the U.S. and its territories, players don’t need to enter the MLB draft and can become free agents. Tallying up the signings in the Cuban market since 2009 reveals payments to those players of nearly $800 million. The industry-standard fee for the people who help those Cubans sign as free agents is 30 percent of the full value of a player’s first professional contract. Theoretically, then, the networks have grossed more than $240 million.</p>\n<p>And so a whole clandestine industry has bloomed. It entails a loose and overlapping confederation of specialists: the operatives who approach players in Cuba and recruit them to leave; the <i>lancheros</i>, or boat captains, who sneak the players off the island; the fixers who obtain “expedited” residency papers for the players in underdeveloped countries; the middlemen, arbitrageurs of the Cuban market, who buy and sell but don’t hold on to the players; the handlers who deal with the day-to-day care and feeding of the players once they’ve settled outside Cuba; the trainers who coach the players as they prepare to showcase their talents to MLB teams; the agents who negotiate with team executives; and the buy-and-hold investors who effectively bankroll the whole thing, taking a large cut of the action.</p>\n<p>Still, every boom plants the seeds of its own destruction, and like the subprime mortgage industry in 2009, the Cuban market is now in something like a crisis. Far too many marginal players have been brought out of the country, and in the Dominican Republic and South Florida today, unsigned Cubans are so numerous that they form their own discrete group, like a refugee community.</p>\n<p>The business model that produced the glut is akin to studio Hollywood: A blockbuster like Yusniel Diaz, who left Cuba in 2015 and signed with the Dodgers for $15.5 million, more than covers the cost of a dozen failed prospects, creating the incentive to bring out as many players as possible and increase the odds that you have a winner among them. So the operatives go into Cuba with their aggressive sales pitches. “<i>Te venden un sueño</i> ,” says one Cuban player. (They sell you a dream.) Adds a longtime agent: “It’s not fair to the Cubans because they’re sold a bill of goods. At the end of the day, the players are the victims.”</p>\n<p>When a veteran Dominican trainer is asked whether the glut might dissuade smugglers from bringing in fresh talent, he laughs. “If they could,” he says, “they would bring them <i>all</i> out … and leave the fields of Cuba empty.”</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_143/storage/images/media2/images/espnus170626_article_056_01_03/4527771-1-eng-US/espnus170626_article_056_01_032.jpg\" width=\"1288\" height=\"783\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"espnus170626_article_056_01_03\" title=\"espnus170626_article_056_01_03\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>“Every day my desire to go back to Cuba grows more,” says Lerys Aguilera, now in his third year in the Dominican Republic.</b></p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p class=\"pullQuote\"><b>“TE VENDEN UN SUEÑO,” SAYS ONE CUBAN BALLPLAYER. (THEY SELL YOU A DREAM.)</b></p>\n<p><b>THE PROFILE PICTURE</b> on Lerys Aguilera’s Facebook page shows him in his green and white Holguín Hounds uniform, pointing both index fingers to the sky as he crosses home plate after blasting his 100th career home run in Cuba. The social media network is extensively used by the Cuban pelotero diaspora, and when I contacted Aguilera in December through it, he agreed to meet. At the time, he remained unsigned after nearly three years in the Dominican, a highly negative indicator. According to the many players, scouts and agents I’d spoken with, the shelf life of a player, once on the market, is about eight months, after which his value plummets toward nothing.</p>\n<p>And still, Aguilera wasn’t ready to give up. An evangelical Christian, he leaned heavily on his religion for support. He attended service almost every day at a small church, Fuente de Salvación, a short walk from his apartment. His apartment building was populated mostly with Haitian immigrants. Mildew crept down the walls from the ceilings. For water to bathe in, Aguilera had to walk downstairs to a cistern and haul it up in buckets. He was subsisting on the charity of a new sponsor who wanted to help the player take one last shot, but the sponsor had limited funds. Aguilera trained daily with a handful of Dominican teenagers in a trash-strewn grove of locust trees by the side of a major four-lane road. It was not any kind of public park, just a stand of trees. They blocked off a portion of the nearest lane of the road with small orange cones and took turns pushing an oversized tractor tire up and back down the inclined pavement.</p>\n<p>Aguilera spoke frequently about his wife, the medical student he fled Cuba to be with. They had broken up but weren’t yet divorced, and he was hopeful they would soon reconcile; he was working on that, he said. They had met almost 10 years earlier. He remembered the exact moment. And so does his wife, Dr. Mercedes Valdez, now a general practitioner in her Dominican hometown. A baseball fan since childhood, she and a group of her medical student friends had walked into Calixto García Íñiguez Stadium, home of the Holguín Sabuesos, to watch a practice in November 2007. “The minute I saw him,” Valdez says, “I was like: ‘No. 17! <i>He’s mine!’</i> ” As practice broke, Aguilera approached the group. “And I started flirting with him,” she says. “I told him: You’re my favorite player.” (In Aguilera’s words: “It was like love at first sight.”) They married in 2012. Valdez would have liked to have remained in Cuba forever, she says. She believes they’d still be together today if they had. “We had problems, like every marriage, but we always solved them together,” she says. “When he came here, he changed a lot.”</p>\n<p>Aguilera’s smugglers brought him in on the new standard route for Cuban players. Over prior years, the networks had shifted their routes east, away from the Mexican pipeline, toward the island that Haiti and the Dominican Republic share.</p>\n<p>This made good sense. The Mexico route meant dealing with Los Zetas, the ultraviolent crime cartel. Also, Cuba’s eastern tip is only about 60 miles from the western shoreline of Haiti, a nation of loosely enforced residency laws, and the D.R. has a vibrant baseball infrastructure, with all 30 MLB franchises hosting academies there. Suffice to say, the Cuban smuggling business has plugged quite naturally into the Dominican baseball industry, which has a whole rancid history of its own. That industry is centered on the country’s so-called <i>buscones</i> , Spanish for “searchers,” which refers to the private academy operators and trainers who develop prospects in the D.R.</p>\n<p>After crossing the Haitian border into the Dominican Republic, Aguilera was delivered directly into the hands of two men he came to know as Brito and Ernesto. By all appearances, they were his investors and his handlers. They put him up in a little hotel in the town of Cotuí. They gave him spending money. Every weekday Aguilera and several other recently arrived Cuban players would train at a ballfield some miles away in the countryside. In Aguilera’s telling, he was living again in a low-information environment. Though friendly and hospitable, Brito and Ernesto told him <i>nada</i> .</p>\n<p>Then one day a man named Rudy Santin showed up in Cotuí. For 25 years a scout with the Yankees and Devil Rays, Santin was one of the best-connected buscones in the Dominican and had a long history with the Cuban market. Santin, who was born in Cuba and raised in Miami, says he’s the one who originated the concept of obtaining foreign-country residencies for Cuban ballplayers to avoid the draft and cash in on free agency.</p>\n<p>At a field in Cotuí, Aguilera worked out for Santin, and his performance was impressive enough that Santin agreed to bring him to his MVP Sports baseball academy in Santo Domingo. For top prospects, buscones and agents will sometimes fork over hundreds of thousands of dollars to the likes of Brito. But in Santin’s mind, Aguilera was not talented enough to merit such an up-front payment to Brito. “He was not a guy you would purchase,” Santin says.</p>\n<p>So they worked out a percentage deal for Aguilera. Each would receive 10 percent of whatever Aguilera signed for, according to Santin, who says he has no idea whether Brito or Ernesto or both were the ones who arranged or paid for Aguilera’s transport out of Cuba. “I couldn’t answer that,” he says. But several people involved in the Cuban market tell ESPN that Brito, a Dominican, and Ernesto, a Cuban, are prominent Cuban player smugglers. According to one agent who would speak only on condition of anonymity, the two men have contacts in Cuba who make the approach to players on the ground, and as soon as the players are out, Brito and Ernesto start calling potential buyers.</p>\n<p><b>IN SANTO DOMINGO,</b> Aguilera lived in San-tin’s own home, along with three other players, two Cubans and a Nicaraguan. To whip Aguilera into shape, Santin hired a trainer named Angel Presinal, who goes by the nickname Nao (pronounced “now”). Under Nao’s stringent tutelage, Aguilera says he lost close to 40 pounds in two months. San-tin also found investors for Aguilera: a pair of Miami attorneys, who gave Aguilera a stipend of between $400 and $600 a month, depending on whom you ask. Santin declined to reveal their identities.</p>\n<p>After some months, his fitness improving, Aguilera began taking part in tryouts and showcases. The one he recalls most clearly took place at the academy belonging to the Giants, in February 2015, 10 months after he’d left Cuba. Perhaps a dozen players took part in the showcase, all of them Cubans, including Héctor Olivera, who would sign with the Dodgers for $62.5 million. Scouts from all 30 teams stood around the field and in the bleachers behind home plate.</p>\n<p>Aguilera was nervous. For the Cuban player migrant, the showcase is the highest-pressure moment of all. As he approached the plate for BP, he knew his time was now. When the pitches came and he started making contact, he could feel the stress vacating his body. He drove balls into right field and left. He launched home runs; he can’t remember how many. When he stood erect after his final swing, the sweat poured from his body. He felt he’d showed everything he had.</p>\n<p>That particular showcase, it turned out, was the peak of Aguilera’s post-Cuba career. After that, he says, his time under Santin became a “disaster.” His daily training grew less routine, less scheduled, until it stopped altogether. He never went back to Nao’s gym. The stipend from his investor shrank, became sporadic, then finally ceased. He missed meals; there wasn’t enough food in the house, he says. The people in charge of applying for and obtaining his Dominican residency, which should have been relatively easy given his marital status, mishandled the paperwork badly. And so he had no residency status anywhere—which meant he could not obtain free agency clearance from MLB, a crucial stage that must be met before a player can sign with a team. Santin himself was almost never around, according to Aguilera. Soon it became clear what was happening: His investor was cutting him off. There was never a hard break, Aguilera says; no one ever explained to him plainly that it was over. Finally, in late summer 2015, he left the house and went to his wife in La Vega.</p>\n<p>Santin denies most of this. “I don’t know what he’s talking about because I bent over backwards for Lerys!” Santin says loudly, almost shouting, over the phone from the Dominican Republic. “My whole beef with these Cubans? <i>And I’m Cuban.</i> But my whole beef is that they’re made out to be like they’re victims! I was a baseball player. I went to Venezuela to play; I went to Colombia to play. I knew what I was getting into! I pitched. My arm was sore. I wasn’t pitching well. They said: ‘Hey, c’mere, you’re done, released!’ What am I gonna do, stay in Venezuela? <i>I’m going to get my ass back to Miami!</i> You gotta know what your talent level is! And if you don’t sign, and if somebody doesn’t sign you, you expect the guy to hold on to you forever? Nobody’s going to do that. That’s just the way baseball is! You can sign right now, in the States, and if you don’t do it, <i>you get released.</i> End of story, that’s it! You’re on your own! No one’s going to carry you! That’s just life! <i>Life!”</i></p>\n<p>Life, as it was for Aguilera, soon unraveled. He and his wife broke up over infidelities Aguilera does not deny, and he now faced the problem every failed Cuban migrant player must confront. The son of a chemist and an engineer, he was untrained in anything except baseball. Groomed from the age of 10 in the hyperfocused, Soviet-modeled athletics system of Cuba, he had no other skills. He earned some pesos by renting himself out to a league of softball teams, as a home-run-clobbering ringer. He sucked up his pride and asked for handouts from friends and acquaintances. One friend from his church owned a <i>pensión</i> in town and let him live in a room there. Another friend was a former Holguín teammate, a pitcher named Yaisel Sierra, smuggled out of Cuba in 2015 and signed by the Dodgers for $30 million. Aguilera says Sierra wired money down from Miami.</p>\n<p>Aguilera says he discovered through the baseball grapevine that an MLB team had made an offer for him but that Santin had rejected it because the figure was too low. Aguilera doesn’t know which team; he doesn’t know the amount offered. Of the many dozens of Cuban players interviewed for this story, nearly every one held a similar belief: that an MLB team had offered him a deal but his handler or agent had said no because it wasn’t enough money. <i>“Absolutely not!”</i> Santin says. “There wasn’t one single bid made for Lerys Aguilera.”</p>\n<p>The rare times when Aguilera was able to communicate with his family in Holguín, he would lie to them: <i>Everything here is great; don’t worry; baseball here is great</i>. But he was growing ever more despondent. For a time, he had access to a friend’s motorbike. One evening outside La Vega, on a stretch of busy twisting highway, he was overcome by an urge: Accelerate and then let go of the handlebars. He raised his left hand from the bar, he twisted the throttle with his right. But the urge passed.</p>\n<p>Around the same time, Aguilera began to consider another form of terminus: going back to Cuba. He was still undocumented in the D.R. If he turned himself in to Dominican immigration authorities, they would send him home on an airliner. He knew of other players who had taken that path. And he knew of still others whose investors paid for their plane tickets home. There was a time when the Cuban government would have prevented defectors from even setting foot in the country again. But times had changed. Now players were being allowed to return; so many players had decamped from the island that Cuba’s baseball federation was desperate for bodies just to fill the league’s rosters. Another Cuban ballplayer in Santin’s academy at the same time as Aguilera chose a different course. On the eastern coast of the Dominican Republic, powerboats once set off in the middle of the night bound for Puerto Rico, a territory of the United States, with Cubans seeking the refuge that setting foot on U.S. soil once afforded them. Many Cuban ballplayers had taken these boats. From one island to another, they were thus smuggled a second time. Aguilera, for his part, decided against both options. He would carry on.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_143/storage/images/media2/images/espnus170626_article_056_01_04/4527764-1-eng-US/espnus170626_article_056_01_042.jpg\" width=\"1322\" height=\"923\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"espnus170626_article_056_01_04\" title=\"espnus170626_article_056_01_04\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>Yandy Suarez was lured out of Cuba with the promise of a baseball academy that did not exist.</b></p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p class=\"pullQuote\">\n<b>“MY BEEF WITH THESE CUBANS?

But Nao has put that behind him. Hired by buscones and handlers and investors, he has become the go-to trainer of Cuban players freshly arrived in the D.R. He says he has trained at least 50 Cubans over the years and has become for them a kind of patron figure, a guru, who treats their minds as well as their bodies. He describes a kind of psychological condition that befalls many Cuban players who arrive in the D.R. but do not immediately sign. “Sometimes they give them too much hope and too much dreams,” Nao says. As the months go by without any offers, they think that time is wasting “and their mind gets blocked,” he says. “<i>Se bloquea la mente</i>.”</p>\n<p>One of Nao’s charges is Darys Bartolomé, who remains unsigned after more than two years out of Cuba, who has lost his investor, who has passed 32 years of age but who does not show signs of <i>una mente bloqueada</i>. He is optimistic and jovial and prone to attempting English phrases when in the presence of gringos. Nao has more or less come to Bartolomé’s rescue, paying him a salary to coach the teenage prospects in the small private baseball academy Nao operates alongside his physical-training practice.</p>\n<p>In Cuba, Bartolomé was a National Series veteran, but he never made it to the summit of baseball on the island: He was never selected for the national team roster that travels to major international championships such as the World Baseball Classic. That’s one of the reasons he decided to accept the smugglers’ offer to get him out of Cuba, he says. He felt stymied. The offer involved flying Bartolomé out on a commercial airliner. Not too long ago, such a thing would have been unthinkable, but in 2013, Cuban President Raúl Castro pushed through a series of reforms that eventually resulted in the easing of travel restrictions for all Cubans. The government no longer required people to obtain an exit visa to leave the country.</p>\n<p>It was only a matter of time, then, before players like Bartolomé were being instructed on where to catch their flights. And by January 2015, when Bartolomé arrived at the airport ticket counter in Havana, a seat in economy had become a more common transportation method for Cubans ditching Cuba than speedboats in the dead of night. But in almost all cases, the players still needed someone to pay for their passports and plane tickets. They still needed someone to pick them up at the airport on the other side. They needed someone to handle the residency paperwork in the country almost all of them were heading to, Haiti. They needed someone to smuggle them into the Dominican Republic. They needed a place to live; they needed someone to get them an agent who could put them in front of MLB scouts; they needed some kind of income while they waited.</p>\n<p>In short, they needed the same networks of people that were smuggling out players by boat. And so it was that Bartolomé’s foreign benefactors bought him his plane ticket—Havana to Panama City to Port-au-Prince. They wired him money with which to pay for a newly issued passport, the equivalent of $107. (National team members are effectively forbidden from possessing their passports; not so the rank-and-file players populating the rosters of the National Series.) And after Bartolomé landed in Port-au-Prince, he met his guides at the airport. They took him to a hotel, where he spent the night. The next day, he flew to Cap-Haïtien, then was driven close to two hours to the town of Ouanaminthe, situated on the banks of the Massacre River. Across the river is the Dominican village of Dajabón. The bridge across the Massacre is one of the four major border checkpoints along the Haitian-Dominican frontier, but there is no checkpoint booth or discernible passport check. It is decidedly low-tech. International commerce of the most micro kind passes without harassment from one country to the other: women balancing baskets of fruit on their heads; bricks of ice covered in sawdust and rapidly melting in the back of wooden pushcarts; Cuban baseball players sitting in the back seats of tinted-window SUVs.</p>\n<p>Bartolomé was nervous. He had his Cuban passport, and even before he’d left Cuba, his handlers had told him they’d already obtained residency status in Haiti for him. But Bartolomé had no Dominican entrance visa; few if any Cuban players ever do. On the Haitian side, the two men up front in the SUV sensed his anxiety. As Bartolomé recounts it, they told him not to worry. The man in the passenger seat was a member of the Haitian military. He flashed his ID, and they drove across the bridge. On the Dominican side, Bartolomé was ushered into another vehicle. Waiting for him inside was a driver and another military man—this time with the armed services of the Dominican Republic. On the road out of Dajabón, they came to a series of checkpoints with men in fatigues stopping cars, but each time Bartolomé’s car was waved through.</p>\n<p><i>No hay problema.</i></p>\n<p>Bartolomé had good reason to be stressed. The first days and weeks of a Cuban player’s life in the D.R. can be fraught with dangers. Like Bartolomé, almost every Cuban player is living illegally there. Because of that basic fact, according to multiple people involved in the Cuban market, members of the Dominican immigration police will sometimes unearth the location of a Cuban player—or group of Cuban players—and raid the building. Often the officers will demand a sum of money. The demand is almost always asked of the investor, not the player. If the investor declines to pay, the player is deported.</p>\n<p>A spokesman for the Dominican Department of Immigration says the ministry was unaware of any such instances and “rejects any activity or extortion of that kind.” But one morning earlier this year, on the patio near the swimming pool of a hotel in Santo Domingo, I met a former high-ranking official in the nation’s law enforcement establishment who described how Cuban ballplayers become targets. There were members of his country’s military, he said, who sometimes were hired to serve as bodyguards for Cuban players. And these military officers, he said, were “so involved in baseball … they really know which players are valued and which are not. If they see a valued player but he doesn’t have papers? They will always try to get some money off them.”</p>\n<p>He then went on to detail another scheme involving Cuban players and corrupt Dominican officials: An investor or buscone covets a high-value player controlled by a rival investor or buscone. So the first investor hires a few officers in the National Police to abduct the player from the second. Such tales are not hard to come by. Rudy Santin describes how a Cuban player under his care—Alex Guerrero, who eventually signed with the Dodgers for $28 million—was taken and then held for several days in a motel.</p>\n<p>More recently, in May 2015, there was the case of Yaisel Sierra, the friend of Lerys Aguilera who has occasionally sent money to his struggling former teammate. Not long after Sierra himself had been smuggled by boat from Cuba in early 2015, but before he signed his $30 million deal with the Dodgers, he was working out at a Gold’s Gym in Santo Domingo. He was then under the control of a well-known buscone and represented by the Octagon sports agency, based in Chicago. According to two people with direct knowledge of the incident, several policemen walked into the gym, put Sierra in handcuffs and walked him out. Photographs exist of Sierra subsequently inside a jail cell. Some days later, Sierra had new representation: the sports agency of Bart Hernandez—who would go on to be convicted in March of this year in the U.S. on human smuggling charges.</p>\n<p>Darys Bartolomé never had to deal with anything like that. His nearly 12-hour journey by car from the Haitian border ended in a beach town called Juan Dolio, not far from Boca Chica, on the Dominican southeast coast. Boca Chica is MLB central in the D.R.; most clubs have their academies somewhere close by. After a few days of workouts in front of potential buyers, Bartolomé says he was sold for more than $100,000 to Julio Lugo—who Red Sox fans might recall as the middle infielder on their 2007 championship team. Bartolomé says Lugo took possession of his passport and took Bartolomé to a trainer in the town of Yamasá. (Efforts to reach Lugo were unsuccessful.) The relationship did not end well, with Bartolomé eventually living in a house without electricity, where he caught dengue fever and was saved by Nao, who paid for his hospital bill, and by a Yamasá woman who helped nurse Bartolomé back to life. And still, despite all that, <i>la mente no se bloquea</i>.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_143/storage/images/media2/images/espnus170626_article_056_01_05/4527757-1-eng-US/espnus170626_article_056_01_052.jpg\" width=\"1194\" height=\"850\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"espnus170626_article_056_01_05\" title=\"espnus170626_article_056_01_05\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>Trainer Angel Nao” Presinal at his gym, incubator of baseball dreamers.</b></p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p class=\"pullQuote\">\n<b>“YOU DON’T GET FRIENDS IN THIS BUSINESS. YOU ONLY GET PEOPLE TRYING TO CHEAT YOU.”</b><br /><b>LERYS AGUILERA, CUBAN BALLPLAYER</b></p>\n<p><b>LISBAN CORREA DIDNÕT</b> like what he was hearing—or, rather, how he was hearing it. Along with five other players freshly arrived in the country from Cuba, he was sitting in a small, windowless back office deep inside the Dominican consulate in Port-au-Prince. It was July 2015. A Santo Domingo lawyer sat in front of the players at a desk, spewing a stream of dense legal language. “This commits the parties involved to pay said sum to the respective beneficiaries without any loss …” He was reading from the text of a contract that Correa could barely follow, but he knew this much: The contract was meant to bind the players to the man who would be their investor.</p>\n<p>The players had all arrived in Haiti separately but had been stored together the past two weeks in the same Port-au-Prince hotel—and treated as a package deal. As they soon learned, their original investor had bailed, unable to afford the cost of six expedited Haitian residencies. This was a bespoke service for Cuban ballplayers. According to U.S. law enforcement, rates started at $6,000 per player and went up from there based on the projected value of the Cuban player. (The investors in Rusney Castillo, who signed in 2014 with the Red Sox for $72.5 million, paid $60,000 for a Haitian residency, according to court documents.)</p>\n<p>Correa was more worldly than his compatriots. He was a big-city kid, Havana born and raised. At 29, he was also older than the others, at the cusp of his career’s downslope—he felt, in retrospect, that he’d waited too long to leave Cuba. A power-hitting catcher with a .284 lifetime average, he was the scion of a baseball family. His grandfather was a pro in the Cuban league pre-Castro. His father, Ivan Correa, was on the Cuban national team that traveled to the U.S. in 1999 to face the Orioles. Before boarding his flight to Haiti, Correa took advice from his parents: <i>be wary; trust no one; view with suspicion those in the baseball business of the outside world.</i> And so Correa, in the office in the consulate, took out his cellphone and surreptitiously began to videotape the meeting.</p>\n<p>A replacement investor had been found for the players, they were told, and the lawyer reading the contract was the attorney for the new one. Even before they leave Cuba, most players now understand that if they ultimately sign with an MLB franchise, 30 percent of their first contract is the standard cut they must pay to their investors. But there was confusion in the room over the terms. Players were talking over each other, asking questions, not understanding.</p>\n<p>There was another man in the room besides the lawyer and the players, standing off camera for most of the video’s duration. But you can hear his voice as he interrupts the lawyer. The principal investor will take 20 percent, he explains, and two other guys—one nicknamed Duni and the other Osbeyare to split the final 10 percent. Duni and Osbey, the players already knew, were part of the breed of adventurers who travel to Cuba to recruit players to leave, including Correa and the other five. “Him and I have already negotiated things for you,” the man says. And, later: “There is no alternative there.”</p>\n<p>A little over a month later, Correa and the five other players finally arrived on Dominican soil, crossing through Dajabón. They were driven all the way to San Pedro de Macorís, on the southern coast east of Boca Chica, and put up in a hotel. They were now under the care of their new American investor, a businessman in his 50s named Nelson Tiburcio, who owned a popular Dominican restaurant in Palm Beach, Florida, called the Don Cafe and lived in one of the gated Mc-Mansion communities to the west of it.</p>\n<p>At first, when still in Haiti, Lisban Correa and the other five players had refused to sign the contract Tiburcio’s lawyer had read to them. They’d objected to the fact that they’d be on the hook for all expenses. That is, whatever Tiburcio would eventually spend on them—rent, food, gym memberships—would accrue to the players themselves. Per the contract’s wording, there was no limit on the amount. So the players had balked, smartly, at Correa’s instigation. But once they got to San Pedro, their handler presented them with the very same contract to sign. The players had no legal representation of their own, and they were not given copies of the contract to read for themselves. When Correa asked whether he could take photos of the contract, his handler became angry but ultimately relented. Crucially, the handler also had possession of all the players’ passports. Tiburcio calls it common practice, a hedge against a player jumping to a rival buscone: “That’s the only collateral you’ve got.”</p>\n<p>According to Correa, the handler told them, in effect: <i>If you don’t want to sign this contract, fine. Feel free to walk away. But you’ll have to leave the hotel. You’ll have to leave our care. You’ll be on your own</i>. So what was Correa going to do? His handler had his passport. His investor was paying for his shelter. He had no money other than what his handler doled out. If he were to leave the care of his handler, where would he go? He was undocumented in the Dominican. Would he turn himself in to the authorities so they could deport him back to Cuba? To Haiti? Then what? “<i>Empezar a jugar pelota</i>,” he says. He just wanted to start playing baseball. He wanted to start training and get on with it. And so Correa signed the contract. He felt he had no choice.</p>\n<p><b>AS OF JUNE,</b> Lerys Aguilera remains unsigned, and he and his wife have not reconciled. He has moved out of the Santo Domingo apartment and gone back to rural Cotuí, to train with the coach he had when he arrived from Cuba in 2014. “I will keep trying until I can’t,” he says. But he has a dim view of the baseball system outside of Cuba. “The worst part is that you don’t get friends in this. You only get people who try to cheat you.”</p>\n<p>Darys Bartolomé, still unsigned, still working for Nao, also hasn’t given up. He insists it’s but a matter of time; scouts from leagues outside the U.S. have lately been showing interest in him. “God willing,” he says, “I’ll be going to Japan.”</p>\n<p>Lisban Correa got passed along to another investor, who eventually cut him off toward the end of last year. He had nowhere to go. The idea of getting himself deported, of returning home, filled him with shame. “I didn’t want to go back to Cuba,” he says. “I didn’t want to return and see myself as a failure.” During his time with his prior investors, he had, bit by bit, socked away an emergency fund of about $100. With it he bought bus tickets and, for two weeks, traveled the D.R. almost from end to end, visiting academies and trainers and investors, shopping himself around. There were no takers. He breaks down in tears when describing those two weeks; he picks at a scab on his palm, a batting practice wound. “I have trained a great deal,” he says, “with very little hope.”</p>\n<p>Eventually, though, hope returned. He found a benefactor in the academy of Jose Canó, the father of Seattle Mariners All-Star Robinson Canó, and soon Correa was participating in tryouts and showcases in front of scouts for the Mariners, Brewers and Tigers. Last year Correa received a gift from his investor at the time. It was a heavy maple 341/2-inch cudgel of a bat engraved on the barrel with the name Yoenis Céspedes, to whom it had once belonged. It became one of Correa’s prized possessions, a talisman. Correa had used it in all the MLB tryouts he’d participated in since—for Céspedes represented all that every Cuban baseball migrant ever dreamed of becoming—and was using it in April during a showcase with the Tigers when he took a mighty swing at a fastball down the pipe. In the instant of contact, he knew it was a mishit. The bat shattered in his hands.</p>\n","layout":{"landscape":{"id":"am-rs-landscape-2","link":"feature-l.twig"},"portrait":{"id":"am-rs-portrait-2","link":"feature.twig"}},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":1,"link_source":"","image":[{"id":"zinio_espnus170626_article_056_01_image_0_1497518554.6235","name":"espnus170626_article_056_01_01","source":"PHOTOGRAPHS BY LISETTE POOLE","caption":"<p><b>Darys Bartolomé left Cuba in 2015 in search of riches.

So you’d be <i>in the game</i>. You know what I mean?”</p>\n<p>That is the Cuban attitude toward baseball. One way or another, we’re in the game.</p>\n<p>I learned about the game mostly from Tito’s dad, my grandfather Pipo, a lifelong aficionado who emigrated from Havana to California in 1958. In a very close family, I was particularly close with Pipo. He was widowed in 1970 at the age of 71 and then was looked after—“spoiled” might not be entirely the wrong word—by a large gang of adoring relatives, myself included. His children—Tito, my mother, Consuelo, and their sister, Carmen—are reminiscing with me one recent afternoon over Chinese takeaway at my mom’s house in Garden Grove.</p>\n<p>In Cuba, baseball is generally known as pelota (ball). The game is an institution that binds Cuban families and communities. At the deepest heart of it, baseball in Cuba is an emblem of resistance to—and eventual freedom from—the island’s Spanish colonial masters, but that is another story. For my family, it’s one of the strongest and most comforting connections between Havana, the beautiful place they left, and an unfamiliar new world. Baseball helped make California into home.</p>\n<p>Twice in his life Pipo escaped from extremely hairy political situations. As a teenager in Tenerife, Spain, in 1916, he resolved to avoid any part in the Moroccan conflict, dodged the draft and took himself to Cuba, where he eventually established himself in a modest way in the cement tile business. He fell in love with his laundress’s young daughter, my grandmother. They raised their family in the working-class Havana neighborhood of El Cerro, three blocks from where El Gran Stadium would open in 1946. In the early 1950s, my grandfather came to Los Angeles to do a contract tile job at the Ambassador Hotel and he fell in love with California. By the time Fidel Castro came to power in 1959, our whole family had immigrated to Long Beach. They didn’t know that there would be no going back.</p>\n<p><b>FOR ME, BASEBALL</b> is intimately connected with the lovely summer feeling of being safe and happy, and the anticipation of having really delicious soup for lunch at my grandfather’s house. The games I’d watch with him as a young child helped form my idea of “safe.” After a struggle, a race, you lunge for this very small space, a straw-filled canvas bag, heart pounding—and for a little while, nothing can touch you. A feeling, a scene you’d imitate in parks and at school during PE, wearing a neat little blue uniform with your name stitched in white thread over the breast pocket. On television, the fantastically dressed umpire’s hands spread wide in that unmistakable gesture, so full of drama and justice. So full of life. <i>Safe!</i></p>\n<p>Though twice uprooted, Pipo had the most admirable and successful life of anyone I’ve ever known. He was a working-class guy who had near-absolute independence until his peaceful death at the age of 87. He had a long and happy marriage and a loving family. His home was small but his own, all paid for, with a bit of garden where he grew magnificent roses and tomatoes and puttered around, fixing things, growing things, with his huge, powerful craftsman’s hands. There was a weathered wooden shed in the back, cool and dark inside, smelling of earth and filled with mysterious artifacts and implements for gardening and building. There was a yard in front that he mowed himself, a tiny kitchen whence marvels arose every day. His very good friend, Mr. Oyama, slightly younger and likewise widowed, lived across the street. He’d come over for a little whiskey, and they would tell jokes, shared in an incomprehensible pidgin of their own decadeslong devising. (Pipo spoke no Japanese and Mr. Oyama spoke very little Spanish. They both loved baseball, though.)</p>\n<p>In the sitting room, in a blond wood cabinet opposite a strategically placed reclining chair, sat the television, whose chief purpose was to bring news of the Dodgers. There was a ritual for watching baseball games: The sound would be turned all the way down by means of a knob on the front of what people still called “the set.” The console stereo against the opposite wall had an AM band, and Vin Scully would be turned all the way up for the duration of the game. I must have been in my 20s before I realized that my grandfather, who barely spoke English, had always been so particular about this. I later learned that many other grandparents and parents were in the same habit, denying the TV announcer his voice in favor of the radio titan (who would one day become a TV titan too). Something in Vin Scully’s voice embodied everything fun, not just in baseball but in the world. Everything safe.</p>\n<p>When Mimina, my grandmother, was still alive, there were many large, lazy family gatherings at their house on the weekends, with the women in the kitchen gossiping and making arroz con pollo or carne con papas or congri, and the men in the living room watching the game or playing dominoes or arguing about politics. Later everyone would gather to eat, and then there’d be Cuban music and maybe a little dancing.</p>\n<p>Every day in the summer a gaily painted ice cream truck drove past my grandfather’s house. It didn’t play one of those awful calliope songs, chiming instead with a solitary, slightly mournful-sounding bell. The driver—for years the same quiet, portly man—sold soft-serve ice cream of the most delicious quality, dipped in chocolate if you liked. There was also a plain gray moving van that came once or twice a week, a mobile Japanese grocery with impossibly exotic products inside, including my favorite Botan Rice Candy, with the rice-paper wrapping so delicate, the candy within so lushly soft and toothsome.</p>\n<p>There were a lot of Japanese people in my grandfather’s West Long Beach neighborhood. I remember walking past the splendor of so many front yards with small cypress trees pruned into romantic, windswept forms, stone figures or even a tiny, red-lacquered bridge. Only years later did I understand that many of these families, including Mr. Oyama’s, had been among the 120,000 Japanese-Americans forcibly removed from their homes and interned during WWII, mostly in the spring of 1942. Many lost all their property as a result, forced to sell everything at ludicrous prices in the few hours they had before being imprisoned.</p>\n<p>At Mr. Oyama’s funeral, Tito says, he learned a lot of things we hadn’t known about him before: Mr. Oyama had been a judo teacher, a mandolin player, a fisherman. To us, he was someone Pipo loved, a delightful guy, round of face and physique, a big joker. (A favorite family story has Mr. Oyama shouting, “Hey! Watch my <i>culo</i>!” when my brother nearly backed into him one day as he was parking his car.) But Mr. Oyama was someone who also had been uprooted. I was too young then to understand how this goofy, charming character could possibly be concealing such a loss.</p>\n<p class=\"pullQuote\"><b>VIN SCULLY WOULD BE TURNED ALL THE WAY UP.MY GRANDFATHER, WHO BARELY SPOKE ENGLISH, WAS ALWAYS PARTICULAR ABOUT THIS.</b></p>\n<p><b>MY GRANDFATHER’S LOYALTY</b> to the Dodgers wasn’t only a matter of affiliation with his new home; the Dodgers had a real link to Havana too. The Brooklyn Dodgers trained three times in Cuba in the 1940s and were treated like royalty there. My mom, aunt and uncle couldn’t remember whether Pipo watched them play in Cuba; it’s too long ago. But Pipo loved coming to LA to see the Dodgers play in the 1960s and ’70s. Tito and my late father would luck into especially good tickets sometimes through work. My dad was a barber to several guys in professional sports, and Tito was a shop steward and foreman at a local can factory. “One English guy, he kinda liked my dad,” Tito tells me. “And he would get me tickets. We got seats behind … or not behind, but almost inside the dugout, with the Dodgers.” He becomes so youthful and animated remembering this. “And Garvey would be in the batter’s box and ‘Look! Look, look! Six! <i>Six!</i> Galbi! Galbi!!’” (I took a particular interest in Six myself, as I recall, as did many of my fellow tweens. Steve Garvey was fantastically handsome.)</p>\n<p>Over many years I came to realize that the deeper meanings of baseball, particularly as it was once played in Cuba, with its ethical frameworks of freedom, beauty and egalitarianism, informed my grandfather’s thinking more than politics or religion ever did. Pipo taking his time—over choosing vegetables in the market, or slicing them up in the kitchen, or setting up the radio to watch the game—took on a certain … I don’t want to say gravity, because he was all about relaxing and enjoying life, but more like he conducted himself in a way that indicated to me these things were <i>important</i>, and worthy of patience and attention. This soup? Important. Likewise this baseball play. Harmless and lovely things, pleasurable things, were also serious things. He modeled, but never explained, a way of thinking, a way of living that is central for me even now.</p>\n<p>I could say that my grandfather’s philosophy is mainly a matter of taking your time, just like in baseball. You do a lot of thinking as you go, and you try to acquit yourself well in even the smallest detail. In my mind, Pipo was—is—invincibly a just man in an unjust world. I would be sitting on the sofa, you know, maybe trying to learn to crochet, not really paying much attention to the game. But I don’t think, before or since, I’ve ever been so at peace as I was then.</p>\n<p><b>WHEN PIPO GOT</b> really sick, we had a caregiver come in for him, a lovely young woman of 30 or so named Blanca. She had a shy, sweet smile, raven hair and a lustrous complexion, and Pipo fell in love with her instantly. She was meant to be shopping, cleaning and cooking for him, but you’d go over there and he would be fixing <i>her</i> lunch, while she sat quietly at his little yellow Formica kitchen table, smiling radiantly, as if in on a private joke. What amount of money would have been enough to pay for such a return of happiness near the end of his story? Blanca would sit and watch television, including baseball, with him for ages, no doubt. She was hopeless at the stuff she’d been hired to do and a champion at all the rest.</p>\n<p>I miss him so much, still.</p>\n<p>When I go home to Long Beach, there are a lot of old haunts from my childhood and teen years I still visit from time to time. Acres of Books is closed now, but the Hof ’s Hut on Bellflower is still serving “Those Potatoes,” which are basically hash browns with minced peppers and onions. You can still go to the Queen Mary, the Art Theater, the museum and Joe Jost’s. But for my Cuban family, all their home places were lost forever after they came to California. Whatever could be salvaged from their past had to be brought in memories, photographs, habits, music. Baseball, and the ideas that come with it.</p>\n<p>My mom’s face and Tito’s light up just talking about El Gran Stadium, where the chief rivalry was between the two biggest city teams, Almendares and Habana. Blues vs. Reds. My mom used to like Cienfuegos (“Hundred Fires”), she tells me, which was a regional team from a legendarily beautiful part of the country—Yasiel Puig’s hometown, in fact.</p>\n<p>“That was my grandfather’s team. But that was sentimental. … My heart was for the Almendares.” There would be big fights over baseball, she says, when she went on tour as a dancer all over Cuba.</p>\n<p>Were there fights in the stadium? “Oh yeah,” they chime in unison. People wouldn’t get beat up too often, but there was a lot of yelling.</p>\n<p>“<i>I</i> didn’t fight,” says my mom, primly. “But I was mad.”</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_143/storage/images/media2/images/espnus170626_article_068_01_02/4527809-1-eng-US/espnus170626_article_068_01_022.jpg\" width=\"845\" height=\"904\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"espnus170626_article_068_01_02\" title=\"espnus170626_article_068_01_02\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p><b>IT’S BEEN A</b> real solace to remember my grandfather lately, not least because he experienced very perilous economic and political conditions, including two world wars, and made it through to peaceful and prosperous times—a fine old age with no bitterness, his sense of humor still warm and sweet as a child’s. So many times it must have seemed to him that the whole world had gone irreparably off the rails. How must he have felt in 1916, in 1940, in 1959? But he just figured something out and got on with his life. Somehow it all worked out fine. May we all have Pipo’s luck. Like in the old Spanish toast: <i>Salud, amor y pesetas, y tiempo para gozarlos</i>. (Health, love and coin, and time enough to enjoy them.)</p>\n<p>All my life, Cuba was described to me as a wonderful place that has been ruined, which is why I’ve never wanted to go. It also goes against my conscience to visit tourist places where I can go enjoy things that the people who live there can’t. But when I saw the Obamas doing the wave with Cubans in the stands at a baseball game during their visit in 2016, I thought for the first time that I might like to go one day and do that too, and try to recover something of my grandfather there, something of my family’s long-ago life. In the video of the Obamas’ visit, MLB chief baseball officer Joe Torre says, “I think the two countries, the one thing they agree on, for sure, is how much they love the game.” My grandfather would have loved that, I know. Baseball is a refuge for people of goodwill to connect with one another in a terrible world, and that’s what it will always mean to me.</p>\n<p>Tito tells me a story about a colleague from work, Mr. Evans, who would come over now and then.</p>\n<p>“You remember my father’s hands?” he begins. Well, obviously! Pipo’s fingers were as thick as knockwursts. To this day I’ve never seen stronger hands; he’d have me hold up my relatively doll-sized ones against his and laugh and laugh.</p>\n<p>“Well, Mr. Evans was the same way!” Tito says. A big guy, apparently—and a Reds fan. “So I would take Mr. Evans to see my father, and they would shake hands. And my father would say [growling here] ‘Datchherrrr.’” (“Dodgers,” that is.)</p>\n<p>“And Mr. Evans would say [also growling] ‘Cincinnattah.’</p>\n<p>“And they would squeeze a little tighter. And you could see these fingers … purple! They weren’t white, they weren’t red, they were purple. And they would go, ‘Cincinnattah!’ ‘Datchherrrr!’ and then they’d pat each other on the back.”</p>\n<p>“He was really funny,” says my mom.</p>\n<p>“Oh, he was something else,” Tito says. “My dad was something else.”</p>\n","layout":{"landscape":{"id":"am-rs-landscape-2","link":"feature-l.twig"},"portrait":{"id":"am-rs-portrait-2","link":"feature.twig"}},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":1,"link_source":"","image":[{"id":"zinio_espnus170626_article_068_01_image_0_1497518556.7854","name":"espnus170626_article_068_01_01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_143/storage/images/media2/images/espnus170626_article_068_01_01/4527816-1-eng-US/espnus170626_article_068_01_012.jpg?t=story_img_size_768x0&ext/espnus170626_article_068_01_012_story_img_size_768x0.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"1808","height":"1799","legacy_id":"884408","is_default":true},{"id":"zinio_espnus170626_article_068_01_image_0_1497518556.7854","name":"espnus170626_article_068_01_01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_143/storage/images/media2/images/espnus170626_article_068_01_01/4527816-1-eng-US/espnus170626_article_068_01_012.jpg?t=story_img_size_768x0&ext/espnus170626_article_068_01_012_story_img_size_768x0.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"1808","height":"1799","legacy_id":"884408","is_default":false}],"related_objects":{"image":[{"id":"zinio_espnus170626_article_068_01_image_1_1497518556.1401","name":"espnus170626_article_068_01_02","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_143/storage/images/media2/images/espnus170626_article_068_01_02/4527809-1-eng-US/espnus170626_article_068_01_022.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"845","height":"904","legacy_id":"884407"},{"id":"zinio_espnus170626_article_068_01_image_1_1497518556.1401","name":"espnus170626_article_068_01_02","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_143/storage/images/media2/images/espnus170626_article_068_01_02/4527809-1-eng-US/espnus170626_article_068_01_022.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"845","height":"904","legacy_id":"884407"}]},"url_alias":"http://espnthemagazine-us.audiencemedia.com","type":"story","order":"12","folio_number":"68","folio_numbers":"68,69,70,72,73","pdf_page_index":"68","thumbnail":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_143/storage/images/media2/images/espnus170626_article_068_01_01/4527816-1-eng-US/espnus170626_article_068_01_012.jpg?t=tablet_story_thumbnail&ext/espnus170626_article_068_01_012_tablet_story_thumbnail.jpg","color":"ef3e36","real_id":"884406","main_section_id":"1414","ads":[]},{"id":"zinio_685_espnus170626_article_074_01_1497518558.0506","title":"THE CIRCLE GAME","sub_title":"","author":[{"id":"0","name":"","email":"noreply@audiencemedia.com","is_default":false}],"tag":"","strap_line":"","intro":"","body":"\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_143/storage/images/media2/images/espnus170626_article_074_01_01/4527840-1-eng-US/espnus170626_article_074_01_012.jpg\" width=\"1913\" height=\"1793\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"espnus170626_article_074_01_01\" title=\"espnus170626_article_074_01_01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n <span class=\"credit\">\nPHOTO BY SCOTT CLARKE / ESPN IMAGES</span></figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p><i>Picture a rectangle. This was the image a player had in mind throughout the 20th century when it came to the conquest and defense of a tennis court. The name of the game was penetration: the ability to generate significant pace and depth. While angles surfaced at times, at heart, traffic was linear, the idea that a player would drive the ball mostly through the court and either force the opponent into mistakes or strike winners. On the lawns of Wimbledon, for example, the most worn-out area was the “T,” where the service line met the center line. This was where an incoming net rusher paused before striking a first volley.</i></p>\n<p>But many changes have broadened the dimensions of the court. In 2001, Wimbledon altered its grass, creating a slower surface that blunted the power of serve-and-volley tennis and triggered longer rallies. This dovetailed perfectly with the ascent of the baseliner, which had started in the 1970s. During that decade, Bjorn Borg, Jimmy Connors and Chris Evert succeeded at Wimbledon by striking forceful ground strokes off both sides—aided greatly by a game changer, the two-handed backhand, a shot that in many cases can be driven with more pace, depth and direction than the classic one-hander. In the ’80s and ’90s, graphite rackets with bigger sweet spots made it easier to generate power—a change accelerated over the past 15 years by a revolution in string technology. These days, the most worn-out area of the court is the baseline.</p>\n<p>Players now take the ball off the court by imparting whiplike topspin from all corners. The need to patrol the space in and around the court is more demanding than ever, requiring an athlete who is quicker, stronger and bigger. In the kill-or-be-killed world of contemporary tennis, a long-standing sports cliché has surfaced: You can’t teach height. Of the eight men who reached the Wimbledon quarterfinals in 2002, only one, Richard Krajicek, was 6-foot-5 or taller. Last year’s final eight included four men who stood that tall.</p>\n<p>“Players need to be in better shape for these longer points,” says Nate Ferguson, owner of Priority One, the company that services the rackets for the men who’ve won the past six Wimbledon titles—Andy Murray, Novak Djokovic and Roger Federer. “If everyone is playing spectacular points, then fitness really matters. You need to be flexible. You need to have speed, the ability to change direction, and ultimate endurance,” Ferguson says.</p>\n<p>So long, rectangle.</p>\n<p>Tennis is now a circle game.</p>\n","layout":{"portrait":{"id":"am-rs-portrait-3","link":"feature_02.twig"}},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":1,"link_source":"","image":[{"id":"zinio_espnus170626_article_074_01_image_0_1497518558.1363","name":"espnus170626_article_074_01_01","source":"PHOTO BY SCOTT CLARKE / ESPN IMAGES","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_143/storage/images/media2/images/espnus170626_article_074_01_01/4527840-1-eng-US/espnus170626_article_074_01_012.jpg?t=default_ipad_portrait&ext/espnus170626_article_074_01_012_default_ipad_portrait.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"768","height":"720","legacy_id":"884411","is_default":true},{"id":"zinio_espnus170626_article_074_01_image_0_1497518558.1363","name":"espnus170626_article_074_01_01","source":"PHOTO BY SCOTT CLARKE / ESPN IMAGES","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_143/storage/images/media2/images/espnus170626_article_074_01_01/4527840-1-eng-US/espnus170626_article_074_01_012.jpg?t=default_ipad_landscape&ext/espnus170626_article_074_01_012_default_ipad_landscape.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"819","height":"768","legacy_id":"884411","is_default":false}],"url_alias":"http://espnthemagazine-us.audiencemedia.com","type":"story","order":"13","folio_number":"74","folio_numbers":"74,75","pdf_page_index":"74","thumbnail":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_143/storage/images/media2/images/espnus170626_article_074_01_01/4527840-1-eng-US/espnus170626_article_074_01_012.jpg?t=tablet_story_thumbnail&ext/espnus170626_article_074_01_012_tablet_story_thumbnail.jpg","color":"ef3e36","real_id":"884410","main_section_id":"1414","ads":[]},{"id":"zinio_685_espnus170626_article_076_01_1497518559.4466","title":"MEN’S PREVIEW","sub_title":"","author":[{"id":"0","name":"","email":"noreply@audiencemedia.com","is_default":false}],"tag":"","strap_line":"WIMBLEDON 2017","intro":"","body":"\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_143/storage/images/media2/images/espnus170626_article_076_01_01/4527878-1-eng-US/espnus170626_article_076_01_012.jpg\" width=\"969\" height=\"411\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"espnus170626_article_076_01_01\" title=\"espnus170626_article_076_01_01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p>DEFENDING CHAMPION ANDY MURRAY</p>\n <span class=\"credit\">\nPHOTO BY SCOTT CLARKE / ESPN IMAGES</span></figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>First came Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal. Then, Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray. This quartet, known informally as “The Big Four,” has emphatically demonstrated a stranglehold on contemporary tennis at the All England Lawn Tennis &amp; Croquet Club Limited, owning the past 14 Wimbledon men’s singles titles. While Murray and Djokovic, each of whom turned 30 last month, have raised the champion’s trophy five of the past six years, neither has fared particularly well in 2017, the two thwarted by a mix of injuries and mental disarray. Instead, the 35-year-old Federer and 31-year-old Nadal have been resurgent, each capturing multiple titles. With these four champions and a host of powerful contenders, the stage is set for an intriguing Wimbledon.</p>\n<p>It’s not easy to compete when an entire nation hangs on your every move. But native son Andy Murray has handled this pressure brilliantly. In 2013, he became the first British man to win the men’s singles title since Fred Perry capped off a three-peat in 1936. Murray’s dedication and skill also made it likely his homeland would not have to wait that long for another victory. Sure enough, last year Murray again took the title, winning six of his seven matches in straight sets. Fit, fast and focused, Murray finished 2016 by reaching the pinnacle–becoming No. 1 in the world. Though an elbow injury has hindered him for much of 2017, Murray is hungry for a guaranteed date with destiny: On Monday, July 3, at 1p.m., he is scheduled to enter Centre Court to commence his title defense.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_143/storage/images/media2/images/espnus170626_article_076_01_02/4527871-1-eng-US/espnus170626_article_076_01_022.jpg\" width=\"400\" height=\"473\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"espnus170626_article_076_01_02\" title=\"espnus170626_article_076_01_02\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p>Novak DJOKOVIC</p>\n <span class=\"credit\">\nPHOTO BY ANDRE FERREIRA / GETTY IMAGES</span></figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3>TYPICAL NUMBER OF BALLS USED: <i>54,250</i></h3><h4>2011, 2014, 2015 CHAMPION</h4><p>A year ago, Novak Djokovic arrived at Wimbledon on top of the world. He’d just won Roland Garros—becoming the first man to concurrently hold the titles at all four grand slam events since Rod Laver in 1969. But then it all unraveled: Djokovic was upset in the third round of Wimbledon last year by American Sam Querrey. More slam upsets followed, including a second-round exit from this year’s Australian Open. More recently, Djokovic parted ways with his entire support team—coach, fitness trainer, nutritionist—before seeking advice from Andre Agassi during Roland Garros. But as distraught as Djokovic appears, note that this is a man who has won Wimbledon three times. When all is clicking, his superb footwork, exquisite balance and sustained firepower off the ground make Djokovic one of the finest grass-court players of recent times.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_143/storage/images/media2/images/espnus170626_article_076_01_03/4527864-1-eng-US/espnus170626_article_076_01_032.jpg\" width=\"394\" height=\"509\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"espnus170626_article_076_01_03\" title=\"espnus170626_article_076_01_03\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p>Roger FEDERER</p>\n <span class=\"credit\">\nPHOTO BY SCOTT CLARKE / ESPN IMAGES</span></figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3>RACKET KEY RINGS SOLD IN 2016: <i>7,905</i></h3><h4>2003-2007, 2009, 2012 CHAMPION</h4><p>At Wimbledon a year ago, Roger Federer lost a five-set semifinal to Milos Raonic. That match turned out to be Federer’s last of 2016, as he spent the remainder of the year tending to his injured knee and harnessing his considerable resources. The Roger Resurgence has been the major story of the 2017 tennis year, with Federer taking the Australian Open—his 18th major—and big titles at Indian Wells and Miami. He’s done so with increased aggression and joy, most notably showcasing a sparkling, improved backhand. At 35, Federer has become increasingly prudent about his tournament schedule, building extensive layoffs into his year. But Wimbledon fans can rest easy: Federer is likely to bring every last ounce of his will and skill in the pursuit of a record eighth Wimbledon title.</p>\n","layout":{"landscape":{"id":"am-rs-landscape-3","link":"feature_02-l.twig"},"portrait":{"id":"am-rs-portrait-3","link":"feature_02.twig"}},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":1,"link_source":"","image":[{"id":"zinio_espnus170626_article_076_01_image_0_1497518560.9","name":"espnus170626_article_076_01_01","source":"PHOTO

A wrist injury forced him to withdraw from the tournament last year, and in his four previous appearances at the All England Lawn Tennis &amp; Croquet Club Limited, Nadal has only once advanced to the round of 16. But 2017 has been a renaissance year for the Spanish southpaw, beginning with a run to the final of the Australian Open. In his early days, his game appeared ill-equipped for grass, but Nadal has proved himself a man for all surfaces, taking the Wimbledon title twice (’08, ’10) and reaching the final three times (’06, ’07, ’11).</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_143/storage/images/media2/images/espnus170626_article_078_01_02/4527923-1-eng-US/espnus170626_article_078_01_022.jpg\" width=\"321\" height=\"222\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"espnus170626_article_078_01_02\" title=\"espnus170626_article_078_01_02\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p>Milos RAONIC</p>\n <span class=\"credit\">\nPHOTO BY SCOTT CLARKE / ESPN IMAGES</span></figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3>2016 FINALIST</h3><p>From his early days as a tennis player, Raonic had his sights set on Wimbledon. After all, Raonic’s hero was seven-time Wimbledon champion Pete Sampras. And like Sampras, Raonic has built his game on aggression, confidence and striking boldly on big points. At 6-5, Raonic anchors his game with a smooth, powerful serve that he can pinpoint anywhere. Last year at Wimbledon, Raonic beat Roger Federer in the semis before losing to Andy Murray in the final. Still just 26 years old, Raonic will likely be a factor at Wimbledon for many years to come.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_143/storage/images/media2/images/espnus170626_article_078_01_03/4527916-1-eng-US/espnus170626_article_078_01_032.jpg\" width=\"337\" height=\"279\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"espnus170626_article_078_01_03\" title=\"espnus170626_article_078_01_03\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p>Jack SOCK</p>\n <span class=\"credit\">\nPHOTO BY ADRIAN DENNIS / GETTY IMAGES</span></figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3>2016 THIRD-ROUNDER</h3><p>Three years ago, American Jack Sock tasted victory at Wimbledon, winning the doubles title with Vasek Pospisil in a five-set thriller over the Bryan brothers.

leave a bigger mark on the sport than at Wimbledon. Three notable anniversaries showcase the many ways these athletes make major statements on the grounds of the All England Lawn Tennis & Croquet Club Limited.","body":"<h3>25 YEARS AGO: THE AGASSI AND THE ECSTASY</h3><p>Before 1992, Andre Agassi had yet to fully embrace Wimbledon. Most figured that Wimbledon’s slick lawns would make it the least likely grand slam where he’d finally capture his first major. In the ’92 quarterfinals, the 12th-seeded Agassi took on Boris Becker, who’d reached the Wimbledon finals six of the past seven years. Winning that match in five sets, Agassi next dispatched three-time champion John McEnroe. But in the final, he’d have to wrestle with the hard-serving lefty Goran Ivanisevic. Serving at 4-5 in the fifth, Ivanisevic double-faulted twice, and eventually, down match point, he missed a backhand volley. In the locker room afterward, Agassi stared at the trophy with the pride of a new father.</p>\n<h3>40 YEARS AGO: DELIVERANCE FOR A NATIVE DAUGHTER</h3><p>For Great Britain’s Virginia Wade, Wimbledon had long been a source of trouble. Prior to 1977, the woman dubbed “Our Ginny” had played The Championships 15 times and only twice reached the semis. Though graced with one of the best serves in the game and superb skills around the net, Wade was also often overwhelmed by Wimbledon’s significance. But in 1977, Wade reached the semis without losing a set—and then played perhaps the finest match of her career, taking down titleholder Chris Evert 6-1 in the third set. Favored against Betty Stove in the final, Wade dropped the first set. But then she caught fire, winning nine of the final 10 games before accepting the championship plate from Queen Elizabeth II.</p>\n<h3>50 YEARS AGO: TIPPING POINT</h3><p>In 1967, tennis was split in two. Amateurs played at the grand slam events, but they could not earn prize money. Those who turned pro were banned from those prestigious tournaments. But in 1967, Wimbledon took a bold step. All England Club chairman Herman David wanted Wimbledon to showcase the best tennis in the world. And so it was determined that in August 1967, the All England Club would host an eight-man pro tournament. It was a resounding success. Fans—and many more watching on the BBC—were thrilled to see such grand slam champions as Rod Laver, Ken Rosewall and Pancho Gonzalez return from exile. In the wake of such a successful event, David decreed that come 1968, Wimbledon would be open to all. Wimbledon, a bastion of tradition, was now a trailblazer.</p>\n","layout":{"landscape":{"id":"am-rs-landscape-3","link":"feature_02-l.twig"},"portrait":{"id":"am-rs-portrait-3","link":"feature_02.twig"}},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":1,"link_source":"","image":[],"url_alias":"http://espnthemagazine-us.audiencemedia.com","type":"story","order":"16","folio_number":"78","folio_numbers":"78","pdf_page_index":"78","thumbnail":null,"color":"ef3e36","real_id":"884425","main_section_id":"1414","ads":[]},{"id":"zinio_685_espnus170626_article_080_01_1497518566.4789","title":"WOMEN'S PREVIEW","sub_title":"","author":[{"id":"0","name":"","email":"noreply@audiencemedia.com","is_default":false}],"tag":"","strap_line":"WIMBLEDON 2017","intro":"","body":"\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_143/storage/images/media2/images/espnus170626_article_080_01_01/4527985-1-eng-US/espnus170626_article_080_01_012.jpg\" width=\"969\" height=\"408\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"espnus170626_article_080_01_01\" title=\"espnus170626_article_080_01_01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p>RUNNER-UP 2016 ANGELIQUE KERBER</p>\n <span class=\"credit\">\nPHOTO BY SCOTT CLARKE / ESPN IMAGES</span></figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>Tradition at Wimbledon warrants that on the first Tuesday of The Championships, the defending ladies’ champion enters Centre Court to begin her title defense. But this year will be different: Serena Williams is pregnant and will not compete. In the absence of the seven-time winner, the field is more wide-open than it’s been in years.</p>\n<p>Certainly such past grand slam champions Victoria Azarenka and Venus Williams strongly believe that experience is the passport to victory. But others—veterans and youngsters alike—surely must feel that now is their time to win the most prestigious title in tennis.</p>\n<p>Last year Angelique Kerber was hoping to become only the fourth lefthander to win the women’s singles title at Wimbledon in the open era. Though she lost that championship to Serena Williams, over the course of the fortnight, Kerber dazzled fans and rivals with superb court coverage and excellent counterpunching skills. That effort was part of a career year in which Kerber won the Australian Open and U.S. Open and took silver at the Rio Olympics. Kerber credits much of her ascent to a player-mentor relationship with her long-standing tennis hero and fellow German, seven-time Wimbledon champion Steffi Graf. Though Kerber has struggled to find peak form this year, she has the skills to go the distance.</p>\n<h3>YEARS THE QUEEN HAS VISITED WIMBLEDON: <i>1957, 1962, 1977, 2010</i></h3>\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_143/storage/images/media2/images/espnus170626_article_080_01_02/4527978-1-eng-US/espnus170626_article_080_01_022.jpg\" width=\"393\" height=\"488\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"espnus170626_article_080_01_02\" title=\"espnus170626_article_080_01_02\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p>Victoria AZARENKA</p>\n <span class=\"credit\">\nPHOTO BY MATTHEW STOCKMAN / GETTY IMAGES</span></figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h4>2011, 2012 SEMIFINALIST</h4><p>Unseeded and rusty, Azarenka looks to enter the field at Wimbledon as a crowd-favorite underdog. This will be her first major tournament after giving birth to her son, Leo, just before Christmas. The new mom has ably balanced her family and career, embarking on a rigorous training schedule that has her slated to once again grace the grass courts at the All England Lawn Tennis &amp; Croquet Club Limited with her relentless, aggressive style of play. When we last saw Azarenka in a major, she was withdrawing from the first round of last summer’s French Open with a knee injury, but she should certainly be listed among the contenders at Wimbledon if she’s able to shrug off the cobwebs as expected. The 27-year-old Belarusian’s peak performance at the All England Club came in 2011 and 2012, when she reached back-to-back semifinals.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_143/storage/images/media2/images/espnus170626_article_080_01_03/4527971-1-eng-US/espnus170626_article_080_01_032.jpg\" width=\"387\" height=\"514\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"espnus170626_article_080_01_03\" title=\"espnus170626_article_080_01_03\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p>Karolina PLISKOVA</p>\n <span class=\"credit\">\nPHOTO BY JULIAN FINNEY / GETTY IMAGES</span></figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h4>2013-2016 SECOND-ROUNDER</h4><p>In five appearances at Wimbledon, Karolina Pliskova has never gone past the second round, but that’s expected to change this year. The 25-year-old from the Czech Republic has made considerable strides—and owns a perfect set of tools for the lawns of the All England Lawn Tennis &amp; Croquet Club Limited. Start with a big serve: In 2016, Pliskova struck a tour-leading 530 aces. That’s backed up by flat, powerful ground strokes. Pliskova’s weapons were richly on display in New York last summer, when at the U.S. Open she reached the final, along the way becoming only the fourth player to beat both Venus and Serena Williams at a grand slam

Ferguson is the founder and owner of Priority One, a company that services rackets for touring pros. Throughout the year, Ferguson and colleagues Ron Yu and Glynn Roberts set up shop near a tournament, stringing and preparing rackets day and night.</p>\n<p>Should the forecast call for cooler conditions than usual, the Priority One team likely will string the rackets looser in the quest for more control. If more heat is anticipated, the frame will be strung tighter, permitting greater control.</p>\n<p>Weather isn’t the only concern of the Priority One team. Each player’s racket is a carefully tuned instrument, everything from grip size and shape to string tension and frame weight playing an important role. (Four-time Wimbledon champion Rod Laver enjoyed whittling the wood around his grip.) But in recent years, there has been a major shift in the balance between racket and strings.</p>\n<p>“It used to be that the racket gave you control and the strings gave you power,” says Andy Gerst, spokesman for Tennis Warehouse. “Now it’s just the opposite.”</p>\n<p>The old model: The racket was dead—and heavy. Ivan Lendl reached the ’87 Wimbledon final with a racket that weighed 14.4 ounces, according to Ferguson. The grip was big so that the racket would not twist in the player’s hand. The gut strings were resilient, all the better to generate power.</p>\n<p>The new model: The racket is lively—and lighter (Andy Murray’s frame weighs 12.3 ounces). The grip is small so that a player can easily whip the frame through the point of contact. The string is a hybrid of classic gut for feel and new-school dead polyester for power.</p>\n<p>Strings in particular have dramatically altered the way professional tennis players strike the ball. A gut-strung racket with a smaller head required players—even those as skilled as Laver, Lendl and seven-time Wimbledon champion Pete Sampras—to carefully calibrate power and control, spin and pace. But these days, larger sweet spots, lighter frames and the dead polyester strings have transformed tennis, making it possible for players to generate tremendous racket-head speed and have it all—tons of spin and pace. No matter what the temperature, look for players at this year’s Wimbledon to make the ball sizzle.</p>\n","layout":{"landscape":{"id":"am-rs-landscape-3","link":"feature_02-l.twig"},"portrait":{"id":"am-rs-portrait-3","link":"feature_02.twig"}},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":1,"link_source":"","image":[{"id":"zinio_espnus170626_article_084_01_image_0_1497518573.5051","name":"espnus170626_article_084_01_01","source":"PHOTO BY SCOTT CLARKE / ESPN IMAGES","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_143/storage/images/media2/images/espnus170626_article_084_01_01/4528071-1-eng-US/espnus170626_article_084_01_012.jpg?t=story_img_size_768x0&ext/espnus170626_article_084_01_012_story_img_size_768x0.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"775","height":"1799","legacy_id":"884441","is_default":true},{"id":"zinio_espnus170626_article_084_01_image_0_1497518573.5051","name":"espnus170626_article_084_01_01","source":"PHOTO BY SCOTT CLARKE / ESPN IMAGES","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_143/storage/images/media2/images/espnus170626_article_084_01_01/4528071-1-eng-US/espnus170626_article_084_01_012.jpg?t=story_img_size_768x0&ext/espnus170626_article_084_01_012_story_img_size_768x0.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"775","height":"1799","legacy_id":"884441","is_default":false}],"url_alias":"http://espnthemagazine-us.audiencemedia.com","type":"story","order":"20","folio_number":"84","folio_numbers":"84","pdf_page_index":"84","thumbnail":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_143/storage/images/media2/images/espnus170626_article_084_01_01/4528071-1-eng-US/espnus170626_article_084_01_012.jpg?t=tablet_story_thumbnail&ext/espnus170626_article_084_01_012_tablet_story_thumbnail.jpg","color":"ef3e36","real_id":"884440","main_section_id":"1414","ads":[]},{"id":"zinio_685_espnus170626_article_085_01_1497518574.6742","title":"INTERVIEW WITH A LEGEND","sub_title":"","author":[{"id":"0","name":"","email":"noreply@audiencemedia.com","is_default":false}],"tag":"","strap_line":"","intro":"","body":"\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_143/storage/images/media2/images/espnus170626_article_085_01_01/4528095-1-eng-US/espnus170626_article_085_01_012.jpg\" width=\"811\" height=\"431\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"espnus170626_article_085_01_01\" title=\"espnus170626_article_085_01_01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p>NICK BOLLETTIERI</p>\n <span class=\"credit\">\nPHOTO BY JEAN-YVES RUSZNLEWSKI</span></figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p><i>Twenty-five years ago, Nick Bollettieri was front and center for one of the most surprising title runs in Wimbledon history. On July 5, 1992, Bollettieri’s longtime student, Andre Agassi, won the championship. Agassi is just one of 10 world No.1 players Bollettieri has worked with, a legacy that earned Bollettieri a spot in the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 2014. The brazen power of those who’ve worked with Bollettieri over the past 40 years goes hand-in-hand with the sport’s increasing physicality. Here is more from a one-of-a-kind tennis legend:</i></p>\n<p>Q : When you hear the phrase “tennis has become more physical,” what does that mean to you?</p>\n<p>A: It can mean a couple of things. It means that the points are not just bing-bing, but there’s a lot of running, fighting, jumping—grueling movement. It’s very physical. Body, movement and recovery—everything is part of the game today.</p>\n<p>Give examples of how that plays out.</p>\n<p>Look at Rafael Nadal. What made Nadal? Certainly not beautiful strokes, but he’d grind and grind. He hit that forehand, and then he’d grind. That’s what made him difficult to beat. You know when you play him, you’re in for a battle. It’s almost more like a war. He wasn’t just a tennis player. You were in for it. You’d think you’d hit a winner, but he’d run it down—always using his legs, using his body.</p>\n<p>Why has it gotten more physical?</p>\n<p>A few reasons. Technology of the rackets and the strings. You have bigger and stronger athletes playing the game. Look at the size—6-2, 6-6, 6-10. The game belongs to the big guy. You don’t see these guys 5-9 and 5-11 up in the spotlight. It doesn’t mean that the little guy doesn’t have a chance. But boy, he better be ready to put in a lot of hard work.</p>\n<p>What form did athleticism once take in tennis?</p>\n<p>Many years ago, the strokes were longer and prettier. The grips have changed. You go back to Rod Laver and Roy Emerson and even Pete Sampras. Today, you’ve got full Western grips. Look at the full stroke, a big stroke, even in the volleys. The biggest change today is hitting more forehands—and movement. You can’t just wait ’til the ball comes back. Movement and recovery is huge—absolutely more than it used to be.</p>\n<p>What kind of athleticism is now required?</p>\n<p>It’s a combination of strength, flexibility, movement—but also, some people, like Andre Agassi and Kei Nishikori, are born with eyes, hands and feet. When you’re born with that, and take it to the next level, incredible things can happen. Fitness training has changed. There’s a lot more emphasis on the lower body. Everything starts with the foundation. Yes, the upper-body is important, but you need lower body foundation to better hit the ball so that you use your legs for power and to move into the ball. You get more power from the foundation of your legs—relax, lift up, recover.</p>\n<p>What kind of playing style do you see happening in the future as a result of all these changes?</p>\n<p>What you’re going to see is a more well-rounded game that will be played on every inch of the tennis court. You’ll see a little more serve-and-volley. The influence of [Grigor] Dimitrov and [Roger] Federeryou might even see a few more one-handers. Still, in the long run, the two-handed backhand has more advantages.</p>\n<p>Where do you see physicality going in the years to come?</p>\n<p>You’re going to see the serve and the killer forehand are going to become even more important. The forehands will cover even more of the court. The second serves have got to become even more aggressive. You can have size, you can have strength, you can have strings. But if you don’t feel you’re a winner, you’ve still got to believe you’re a winner, and prove it again and again. That’s what being a champion is all about.</p>\n","layout":{"landscape":{"id":"am-rs-landscape-3","link":"feature_02-l.twig"},"portrait":{"id":"am-rs-portrait-3","link":"feature_02.twig"}},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":1,"link_source":"","image":[{"id":"zinio_espnus170626_article_085_01_image_0_1497518574.7876","name":"espnus170626_article_085_01_01","source":"PHOTO BY JEAN-YVES RUSZNLEWSKI","caption":"<p>NICK BOLLETTIERI</p>\n","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_143/storage/images/media2/images/espnus170626_article_085_01_01/4528095-1-eng-US/espnus170626_article_085_01_012.jpg?t=story_img_size_768x0&ext/espnus170626_article_085_01_012_story_img_size_768x0.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"811","height":"431","legacy_id":"884444","is_default":true},{"id":"zinio_espnus170626_article_085_01_image_0_1497518574.7876","name":"espnus170626_article_085_01_01","source":"PHOTO BY JEAN-YVES RUSZNLEWSKI","caption":"<p>NICK BOLLETTIERI</p>\n","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_143/storage/images/media2/images/espnus170626_article_085_01_01/4528095-1-eng-US/espnus170626_article_085_01_012.jpg?t=story_img_size_768x0&ext/espnus170626_article_085_01_012_story_img_size_768x0.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"811","height":"431","legacy_id":"884444","is_default":false}],"url_alias":"http://espnthemagazine-us.audiencemedia.com","type":"story","order":"21","folio_number":"85","folio_numbers":"85","pdf_page_index":"85","thumbnail":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_143/storage/images/media2/images/espnus170626_article_085_01_01/4528095-1-eng-US/espnus170626_article_085_01_012.jpg?t=tablet_story_thumbnail&ext/espnus170626_article_085_01_012_tablet_story_thumbnail.jpg","color":"ef3e36","real_id":"884443","main_section_id":"1414","ads":[]}],"type":null,"ads":[]}}
