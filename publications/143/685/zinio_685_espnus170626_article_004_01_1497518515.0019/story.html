<p>When we decided 18 months ago to chronicle the lives of Latino ballplayers, who make up more than a quarter of MLB rosters, we knew we wanted to give them the chance to tell their stories. So we turned to Marly Rivera, a Puerto Rican–born reporter for ESPN and ESPN Deportes, and together came up with a list of questions for players: What was hardest when you first moved to the U.S.? How long did it take to learn English? How did you stay in touch with family? Over the next year, we talked to 55 players, with Rivera conducting 28 of the interviews herself. Soon enough, Rivera says, “I realized that I was there to bear witness to their experiences, so I decided to put the list away and just listen.” To represent these experiences as fully and authentically as possible, we divided this issue into two sides, one in English, one in Spanish. On the Spanish side, you’ll find interviews with 11 of the biggest Latino stars, presented in the language in which they were conducted. On the English side, we translated and composed the words of 46 players into a breathtaking oral history. It’s all part of ESPN’s season-long Béisbol Experience project that explores the intersection of Latino culture and baseball—you’ll find other stories from this intersection in this issue and across ESPN TV, ESPN Deportes and <a href="http://ESPN.com" target="_self">ESPN.com</a>. Because, as Rivera puts it, each player has a story worth telling.</p>
<p>In Chicago during the World Series, Marly Rivera interviewed Francisco Lindor, Javier Báez and Roberto Pérez about what it meant to represent Puerto Rico on baseball’s biggest stage.</p>
<p><b>What actually went into making this bilingual issue? Here’s a breakdown:</b></p>
<p><b>300</b> Hours that ESPN Deportes reporter/ translator Rafael Rojas Cremonesi spent translating interviews into English.</p>
<p><b>20</b> MLB clubs repped in “We Live Baseball.” (See page 40.)</p>
<p><b>13</b> Cities visited, in three countries, by Scott Eden for his story “The Lost Prospects of Cuba.” (See page 56.)</p>
<p><b>2</b> Interviews with our cover subject, Manny Machado: one in English, one in Spanish.</p>
