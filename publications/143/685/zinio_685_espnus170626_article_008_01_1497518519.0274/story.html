    </div><h3><b>Alshon Jeffery</b></h3><h4><b>WR | EAGLES</b></h4><p>If he remains healthy and on the field, Jeffery (4,549 yards and 26 TDs in five seasons with the Bears) will be an immediate upgrade for QB Carson Wentz and the Philadelphia offense. He has the size and frame (6-foot-3, 218 pounds) to run inside breaking routes and cause matchup problems in the red zone. His skill set is a perfect match for coach Doug Pederson’s system.</p>
<p>—MATT BOWEN</p>
<h3><b>DeSean Jackson, Calais Campbell</b></h3><h4><b>WR | BUCCANEERS DT | JAGUARS</b></h4><p>Few non-quarterback free agents are good enough to add victories to their teams by themselves. But if you look at efficiency numbers, you can single out Jackson (17.9 ypc with the Redskins last season, tied for first in NFL) and Campbell (90.4 overall grade from Pro Football Focus with the Cardinals, No. 1 among players over 30).</p>
<p>—MIKE SANDO</p>
<h3><b>Martellus Bennett</b></h3><h4><b>TE | PACKERS</b></h4><p>Bennett will give Aaron Rodgers in a full season what Jared Cook provided for the final three weeks of 2016 and the playoffs: a playmaking tight end who changes the way teams defend the Packers. Rodgers noted often how Cook impacted the team, much like Jermichael Finley before him. Bennett (55 catches for 701 yards and 7 TDs for the Patriots) is cut from the same cloth.</p>
<p>—KEVIN SEIFERT</p>
<h3><b>Tony Jefferson</b></h3><h4><b>S | RAVENS</b></h4><p>It’s never easy choosing just one, but the addition of Jefferson gives the Ravens all sorts of flexibility in the back end. The safety duo of Jefferson (a team-leading 96 tackles for the Cardinals in ’16) and Eric Weddle—one of the game’s most consistent players—should bode well for coordinator Dean Pees. The rising value of the safety position around the league should not be overlooked.</p>
