    </div><h3><b>NO. 1 CELTICS MARKELLE FULTZ</b></h3><h4>6-5 | 186 | WASHINGTON | G</h4><p>Though Boston is considering Lonzo Ball, De’Aaron Fox, Josh Jackson and Jayson Tatum, Fultz has been the top guy on Boston’s board for a while. Scouts like the college point as a scorer and shooter, and his ability to play the 2 makes him especially attractive to the Celtics.</p>
<h3><b>NO. 2 LAKERS LONZO BALL</b></h3><h4>6-5 | 195 | UCLA | G</h4><p>The Lakers are trying to stifle talk that Ball to LA is a done deal. That’s mostly an attempt to control the narrative. There is disagreement in the front office about who’s best for the future, and Fox and Jackson have a real shot. But Ball, with his otherworldly passing, is the favorite.</p>
<h3><b>NO. 3 76ERS JOSH JACKSON</b></h3><h4>6-8 | 202 | KANSAS | F</h4><p>There’s a debate between the front office and coaching staff here. Jackson and Fox have elite toughness, athleticism and defensive potential but struggle as shooters, and the Sixers need backcourt players who can stroke it. I’ll give Jackson, an elite two-way player, a slight edge.</p>
<h3><b>NO. 4 SUNS DE’AARON FOX</b></h3><h4>6-3 | 170 | KENTUCKY | G</h4><p>Phoenix would love to see Ball here, but the pick will be Fox or Tatum. The Suns are loaded with offensive talent; getting Fox’s defensive versatility, intensity and playmaking would improve the team and open the door to an Eric Bledsoe trade.</p>
<h3><b>NO. 5 KINGS JAYSON TATUM</b></h3><h4>6-8 | 204 | DUKE | F</h4><p>There is talk in Sacramento of combining picks 5 and 10 to move up in the draft and secure Fox. But that’s a high price to pay. Tatum or Jonathan Isaac could replace Rudy Gay when Gay becomes a free agent this year. Tatum, with his uncanny ability to score, is the safer bet.</p>
<h3><b>NO. 6 MAGIC JONATHAN ISAAC</b></h3><h4>6-11 | 205 | FLORIDA STATE | F</h4><p>Orlando’s front office favors long, athletic, versatile players with upside, and Isaac has as much of that as anyone. But he’s also one of the biggest risks in this draft. Still, his combination of size and skill is highly alluring for any team that can be patient while his body catches up with his talent.</p>
<h3><b>NO. 7 TIMBERWOLVES LAURI MARKKANEN</b></h3><h4>7-0 | 230 | ARIZONA | F</h4><p>Both Isaac and Markkanen are excellent fits for the Wolves, who are looking for a stretch 4. Isaac offers more potential. Markkanen is a more proven shooter. With Isaac off the board, this looks like Markkanen’s spot.</p>
<h3><b>NO. 8 KNICKS MALIK MONK</b></h3><h4>6-3 | 185 | KENTUCKY | G</h4><p>The Knicks are looking at a number of backcourt players, including Monk, Dennis Smith and Frank Ntilikina. Monk, the best scorer in the draft, might be the highest-upside player and best fit of the group. If he lands here, Knicks fans will love him when he heats up.</p>
<h3><b>NO. 9 MAVERICKS DENNIS SMITH</b></h3><h4>6-2 | 190 | NC STATE | G</h4><p>The Mavs have scouted Ntilikina more than any other team, but Smith shoots better, has more athleticism and is more NBA-ready.</p>
<h3><b>NO. 10 KINGS FRANK NTILIKINA</b></h3><h4>6-5 | 180 | FRANCE | G</h4><p>Ntilikina has great size for his position, plays with strength and displays a great feel for the game. He’s also an improving shooter.</p>
<h3><b>NO. 11 HORNETS DONOVAN MITCHELL</b></h3><h4>6-3 | 211 | LOUISVILLE | G</h4><p>Scouts like his elite combination of athleticism, length and versatility—the latter of which will be a strong selling point for the Hornets.</p>
<h3><b>NO. 12 PISTONS LUKE KENNARD</b></h3><h4>6-6 | 196 | DUKE | G</h4><p>Kennard wowed ’em at his pro day with an epic 3-point display and unexpected athleticism (a 38›››-inch max vertical, according to the Lakers).</p>
<h3><b>NO. 13 NUGGETS OG ANUNOBY</b></h3><h4>6-8 | 232 | INDIANA | F</h4><p>Even though he could miss next season rehabbing his knee, Denver could use a long, athletic player who can guard five positions.</p>
<h3><b>NO. 14 HEAT ZACH COLLINS</b></h3><h4>7-0 | 232 | GONZAGA | F/C</h4><p>Collins can stretch the floor and protect the rim. He’s a good athlete, he’s aggressive and his advanced statistics are through the roof.</p>
