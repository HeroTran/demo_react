    </div><p><b>EVERY DRAFT HAS</b> at least one: the lottery pick who defies projections, for better (Klay Thompson) or worse (yikes, Anthony Bennett). Well, we will not be defied any longer! Introducing the NBA-Caliber Player Percentage, a metric that estimates the likelihood that a prospect will turn out to be a productive player—a role player, a starter or an All-Star—in Years 2 to 5 of his NBA career. (Rookie years are omitted because they are often not predictive of future success.) So what’s the verdict on the class of 2017? Lonzo Ball, not Markelle Fultz, has the best shot of being productive—and Frank Ntilikina has the top star potential of all. —PAUL SABIN, ESPN ANALYTICS</p>

<p>* SPM is an approximation of real plus-minus values based on NBA box score values. For players who have played at least one year in D1, SPM projections take into account stats such as eFG%, assists and rebounds after adjustments for opponent strength and pace. For international players, the SPM projections are based on box score data for pro and international competitions. The SPM projections also take into account biographical data and Chad Ford’s Big Board (as of May 25).</p>
