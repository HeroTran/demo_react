    </div><p>Chicago native Jeff Mauro moved to LA to be a comedian and actor before heading home to hone his cooking skills and win the seventh season of <i>Food Network Star.</i> This year he got an even bigger break: His Chicago sandwich shop, Pork &amp; Mindy’s, got a prized spot in Wrigley Field. Star of the network’s <i>Sandwich King</i> for five seasons and now co-host of <i>The Kitchen</i>, Mauro tells us about his Pig Candy BLT.</p>
<p><b>What makes this different from other BLTs?</b></p>
<p>We use our very addictive Pig Candy, which is our caramelized, sugarcoated bacon, as the base, and we have a custom house-made barbecue mayo that we put on there. It’s all served on a beautiful, shiny, buttery bun. Every element is prized.</p>
<p><b>What does it mean to be in Wrigley Field?</b></p>
<p>It’s a dream come true. People eating our food in the stands is surreal. We’re next to Hot Doug’s, which had been a famous gourmet sausage stand in the city, with lines out the door. The one-two punch of pork will be legendary stadium eating.</p>
<p><b>Growing up: Cubs or White Sox?</b></p>
<p>My dad was a Sox fan. We only went to Comiskey Park. I’m not going to say that I hated the Cubs, you know, but you rooted for what you knew. But I’m older. My love for all Chicago sports trumped any allegiance to one team. There’s nothing not to like about going to Cubs games.</p>
<h3><b>PIG CANDY BLT</b></h3><h4><b>INGREDIENTS</b></h4><h5><b>PIG CANDY</b></h5><p>12 to 14 slices apple wood smoked bacon (not thick-cut but not paper-thin)</p>
<p>2 cups light brown sugar</p>
<h4><b>INSTRUCTIONS</b></h4><p>Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Place brown sugar in a pie dish. Gently press each slice of bacon into sugar until coated (patches of naked bacon are OK). Arrange coated bacon on vegetable oil–sprayed wire rack, then place rack on top of a full sheet pan. Bake until extra crispy and golden, 30 to 50 minutes depending on oven, rotating sheet pan halfway through. Remove from rack to prevent sticking; let cool on new surface. Once cool, cut each piece of Pig Candy in half.</p>
<h5><b>CARAMELIZED ONIONS</b></h5><p>2 Maui onions, sliced</p>
<p>2 tbsp. vegetable oil</p>
<p>Dry red wine</p>
<p>Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Place oil and onions in pan and gently sweat, stirring only occasionally. If necessary, deglaze with the red wine. Cook until deep golden brown, about 30 minutes. Season with salt and pepper and set aside.</p>
<h5><b>BBQ RUB AIOLI</b></h5><p>1 cup mayonnaise</p>
<p>2 tbsp. Pork &amp; Mindy’s Sweet BBQ Rub (or another sweet dry rub blend)</p>
<p>1 tsp. hot sauce</p>
<p>In a bowl, mix all ingredients and set aside.</p>
<h4><b>ADDITIONAL INGREDIENTS</b></h4><p>4 brioche buns</p>
<p>1 Roma tomato, sliced medium thickness</p>
<p>4 crispy leaves romaine lettuce</p>
<p>2 tbsp. butter</p>
<h4><b>TO ASSEMBLE</b></h4><p>Butter brioche buns and toast on griddle until golden brown. On each bun, place layer of caramelized onions, 3 to 4 slices of halved Pig Candy and tomato slices; season with salt. Top tomatoes with 1 leaf of lettuce, spread aioli on top bun, close and serve. Makes 4 large sandwiches.</p>
