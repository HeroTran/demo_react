    </div><p><b>THEY ARE OFTEN CHEERED,</b> often celebrated, but how often are Latino baseball players actually understood? That’s the question that inspired ESPN’s Béisbol Experience project, which gives voice to the Latinos who make up a record 26.4 percent of MLB’s rosters and to those trying to join them. Much unites these players—their passion, drive, love of the game—but their lives also contain multitudes. There’s the joy of a Dominican-American who plays with such flourish in Baltimore, and the heartbreak of a Cuban exile whose hope has been stranded halfway here. There’s the comfort that <i>pelota</i> brings to a Cuban-American household, and the loneliness that comes from chasing a dream thousands of miles from home. All season, Béisbol Experience has told these stories, in Spanish and English, across TV, radio, digital—and now in this issue. The stories continue through October—each one bringing the lives of Latino players to light.</p>
<p><b>Béisbol Experience presents a weeklong flight of stories and specials June 19-25. Among the highlights:</b></p>
<p>Interviews with Latino players on <i>SportsCenter</i>; a Béisbol Experience–themed <i>Wednesday Night Baseball</i> game; a David Ortiz feature on <i>Béisbol Esta Noche</i>; and an <a href="http://ESPN.com" target="_self">ESPN.com</a> feature on Brazilian superprospect Eric Pardinho.
