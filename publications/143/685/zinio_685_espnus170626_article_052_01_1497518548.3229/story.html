<p>A portrait of the late José Fernández looks over the shoulders of Hugo Tandron and Christian Yelich. “By the [first] time he sat in the chair and got a haircut, we were friends already,” Tandron says of Fernández. “He was very caring, very loyal. He wouldn’t get his hair cut by anyone but me. I was kind of like his big brother.” The tattooed Tandron (“You don’t count them,” he says of how many he has) is in high demand. Ever since he first cut Gary Sheffield’s hair in 1993 (the two had a mutual friend), players have sought him out, like Justin Bour No appointment needed, they wander in before games, as A.J.

    </div><p>In the depths of Marlins Park sits Headz Up, the only pro barbershop in an MLB stadium. This one-chair joint, run by Hugo “Juice” Tandron, is strictly a players-only experience. With the late José Fernández’s No. 16 on his vest, Juice opens his doors for nearly every home game and takes only what he is offered. “As little as $5 and as much as $10,000,” he says. (And, oh, Dontrelle Willis once gave him a ’74 Chevy Caprice convertible.) Visiting players sit down too: Bryce Harper swears by him, Mike Trout came by, and others fly him to their cities for cuts. For Tandron, a Miami native who owns another Headz Up in town, it’s surreal: “I feel like I’m really dreaming.” Here’s a closer look at how Juice keeps it high and tight.</p>
