    </div><p><i>Picture a rectangle. This was the image a player had in mind throughout the 20th century when it came to the conquest and defense of a tennis court. The name of the game was penetration: the ability to generate significant pace and depth. While angles surfaced at times, at heart, traffic was linear, the idea that a player would drive the ball mostly through the court and either force the opponent into mistakes or strike winners. On the lawns of Wimbledon, for example, the most worn-out area was the “T,” where the service line met the center line. This was where an incoming net rusher paused before striking a first volley.</i></p>
<p>But many changes have broadened the dimensions of the court. In 2001, Wimbledon altered its grass, creating a slower surface that blunted the power of serve-and-volley tennis and triggered longer rallies. This dovetailed perfectly with the ascent of the baseliner, which had started in the 1970s. During that decade, Bjorn Borg, Jimmy Connors and Chris Evert succeeded at Wimbledon by striking forceful ground strokes off both sides—aided greatly by a game changer, the two-handed backhand, a shot that in many cases can be driven with more pace, depth and direction than the classic one-hander. In the ’80s and ’90s, graphite rackets with bigger sweet spots made it easier to generate power—a change accelerated over the past 15 years by a revolution in string technology. These days, the most worn-out area of the court is the baseline.</p>
<p>Players now take the ball off the court by imparting whiplike topspin from all corners. The need to patrol the space in and around the court is more demanding than ever, requiring an athlete who is quicker, stronger and bigger. In the kill-or-be-killed world of contemporary tennis, a long-standing sports cliché has surfaced: You can’t teach height. Of the eight men who reached the Wimbledon quarterfinals in 2002, only one, Richard Krajicek, was 6-foot-5 or taller. Last year’s final eight included four men who stood that tall.</p>
<p>“Players need to be in better shape for these longer points,” says Nate Ferguson, owner of Priority One, the company that services the rackets for the men who’ve won the past six Wimbledon titles—Andy Murray, Novak Djokovic and Roger Federer. “If everyone is playing spectacular points, then fitness really matters. You need to be flexible. You need to have speed, the ability to change direction, and ultimate endurance,” Ferguson says.</p>
<p>So long, rectangle.</p>
<p>Tennis is now a circle game.</p>
