    </div><p>First came Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal. Then, Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray. This quartet, known informally as “The Big Four,” has emphatically demonstrated a stranglehold on contemporary tennis at the All England Lawn Tennis &amp; Croquet Club Limited, owning the past 14 Wimbledon men’s singles titles. While Murray and Djokovic, each of whom turned 30 last month, have raised the champion’s trophy five of the past six years, neither has fared particularly well in 2017, the two thwarted by a mix of injuries and mental disarray. Instead, the 35-year-old Federer and 31-year-old Nadal have been resurgent, each capturing multiple titles. With these four champions and a host of powerful contenders, the stage is set for an intriguing Wimbledon.</p>
<p>It’s not easy to compete when an entire nation hangs on your every move. But native son Andy Murray has handled this pressure brilliantly. In 2013, he became the first British man to win the men’s singles title since Fred Perry capped off a three-peat in 1936. Murray’s dedication and skill also made it likely his homeland would not have to wait that long for another victory. Sure enough, last year Murray again took the title, winning six of his seven matches in straight sets. Fit, fast and focused, Murray finished 2016 by reaching the pinnacle–becoming No. 1 in the world. Though an elbow injury has hindered him for much of 2017, Murray is hungry for a guaranteed date with destiny: On Monday, July 3, at 1p.m., he is scheduled to enter Centre Court to commence his title defense.</p>

    </div><h3>TYPICAL NUMBER OF BALLS USED: <i>54,250</i></h3><h4>2011, 2014, 2015 CHAMPION</h4><p>A year ago, Novak Djokovic arrived at Wimbledon on top of the world. He’d just won Roland Garros—becoming the first man to concurrently hold the titles at all four grand slam events since Rod Laver in 1969. But then it all unraveled: Djokovic was upset in the third round of Wimbledon last year by American Sam Querrey. More slam upsets followed, including a second-round exit from this year’s Australian Open. More recently, Djokovic parted ways with his entire support team—coach, fitness trainer, nutritionist—before seeking advice from Andre Agassi during Roland Garros. But as distraught as Djokovic appears, note that this is a man who has won Wimbledon three times. When all is clicking, his superb footwork, exquisite balance and sustained firepower off the ground make Djokovic one of the finest grass-court players of recent times.</p>

    </div><h3>RACKET KEY RINGS SOLD IN 2016: <i>7,905</i></h3><h4>2003-2007, 2009, 2012 CHAMPION</h4><p>At Wimbledon a year ago, Roger Federer lost a five-set semifinal to Milos Raonic. That match turned out to be Federer’s last of 2016, as he spent the remainder of the year tending to his injured knee and harnessing his considerable resources. The Roger Resurgence has been the major story of the 2017 tennis year, with Federer taking the Australian Open—his 18th major—and big titles at Indian Wells and Miami. He’s done so with increased aggression and joy, most notably showcasing a sparkling, improved backhand. At 35, Federer has become increasingly prudent about his tournament schedule, building extensive layoffs into his year. But Wimbledon fans can rest easy: Federer is likely to bring every last ounce of his will and skill in the pursuit of a record eighth Wimbledon title.</p>
