<h3>25 YEARS AGO: THE AGASSI AND THE ECSTASY</h3><p>Before 1992, Andre Agassi had yet to fully embrace Wimbledon. Most figured that Wimbledon’s slick lawns would make it the least likely grand slam where he’d finally capture his first major. In the ’92 quarterfinals, the 12th-seeded Agassi took on Boris Becker, who’d reached the Wimbledon finals six of the past seven years. Winning that match in five sets, Agassi next dispatched three-time champion John McEnroe. But in the final, he’d have to wrestle with the hard-serving lefty Goran Ivanisevic. Serving at 4-5 in the fifth, Ivanisevic double-faulted twice, and eventually, down match point, he missed a backhand volley. In the locker room afterward, Agassi stared at the trophy with the pride of a new father.</p>
<h3>40 YEARS AGO: DELIVERANCE FOR A NATIVE DAUGHTER</h3><p>For Great Britain’s Virginia Wade, Wimbledon had long been a source of trouble. Prior to 1977, the woman dubbed “Our Ginny” had played The Championships 15 times and only twice reached the semis. Though graced with one of the best serves in the game and superb skills around the net, Wade was also often overwhelmed by Wimbledon’s significance. But in 1977, Wade reached the semis without losing a set—and then played perhaps the finest match of her career, taking down titleholder Chris Evert 6-1 in the third set. Favored against Betty Stove in the final, Wade dropped the first set. But then she caught fire, winning nine of the final 10 games before accepting the championship plate from Queen Elizabeth II.</p>
<h3>50 YEARS AGO: TIPPING POINT</h3><p>In 1967, tennis was split in two. Amateurs played at the grand slam events, but they could not earn prize money. Those who turned pro were banned from those prestigious tournaments. But in 1967, Wimbledon took a bold step. All England Club chairman Herman David wanted Wimbledon to showcase the best tennis in the world. And so it was determined that in August 1967, the All England Club would host an eight-man pro tournament. It was a resounding success. Fans—and many more watching on the BBC—were thrilled to see such grand slam champions as Rod Laver, Ken Rosewall and Pancho Gonzalez return from exile. In the wake of such a successful event, David decreed that come 1968, Wimbledon would be open to all. Wimbledon, a bastion of tradition, was now a trailblazer.</p>
