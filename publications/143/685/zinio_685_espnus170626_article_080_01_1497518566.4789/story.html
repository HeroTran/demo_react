    </div><p>Tradition at Wimbledon warrants that on the first Tuesday of The Championships, the defending ladies’ champion enters Centre Court to begin her title defense. But this year will be different: Serena Williams is pregnant and will not compete. In the absence of the seven-time winner, the field is more wide-open than it’s been in years.</p>
<p>Certainly such past grand slam champions Victoria Azarenka and Venus Williams strongly believe that experience is the passport to victory. But others—veterans and youngsters alike—surely must feel that now is their time to win the most prestigious title in tennis.</p>
<p>Last year Angelique Kerber was hoping to become only the fourth lefthander to win the women’s singles title at Wimbledon in the open era. Though she lost that championship to Serena Williams, over the course of the fortnight, Kerber dazzled fans and rivals with superb court coverage and excellent counterpunching skills. That effort was part of a career year in which Kerber won the Australian Open and U.S. Open and took silver at the Rio Olympics. Kerber credits much of her ascent to a player-mentor relationship with her long-standing tennis hero and fellow German, seven-time Wimbledon champion Steffi Graf. Though Kerber has struggled to find peak form this year, she has the skills to go the distance.</p>

    </div><h4>2011, 2012 SEMIFINALIST</h4><p>Unseeded and rusty, Azarenka looks to enter the field at Wimbledon as a crowd-favorite underdog. This will be her first major tournament after giving birth to her son, Leo, just before Christmas. The new mom has ably balanced her family and career, embarking on a rigorous training schedule that has her slated to once again grace the grass courts at the All England Lawn Tennis &amp; Croquet Club Limited with her relentless, aggressive style of play. When we last saw Azarenka in a major, she was withdrawing from the first round of last summer’s French Open with a knee injury, but she should certainly be listed among the contenders at Wimbledon if she’s able to shrug off the cobwebs as expected. The 27-year-old Belarusian’s peak performance at the All England Club came in 2011 and 2012, when she reached back-to-back semifinals.</p>

    </div><h4>2013-2016 SECOND-ROUNDER</h4><p>In five appearances at Wimbledon, Karolina Pliskova has never gone past the second round, but that’s expected to change this year. The 25-year-old from the Czech Republic has made considerable strides—and owns a perfect set of tools for the lawns of the All England Lawn Tennis &amp; Croquet Club Limited. Start with a big serve: In 2016, Pliskova struck a tour-leading 530 aces. That’s backed up by flat, powerful ground strokes. Pliskova’s weapons were richly on display in New York last summer, when at the U.S. Open she reached the final, along the way becoming only the fourth player to beat both Venus and Serena Williams at a grand slam event.</p>
