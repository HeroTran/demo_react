    </div><h3>2016 SECOND-ROUNDER</h3><p>At the end of 2015, Great Britain’s Johanna Konta finished the year ranked 47th in the world. Her strong work ethic and ability to strike the ball forcefully off both sides have helped elevate her standing since then. Earlier this year, Konta reached the quarters at the Australian Open and took a big title at the Miami Open, ousting former world No. 1 Caroline Wozniacki in the final. Competing this year at her adopted homeland slam as the first British woman in the top 10 in more than 30 years brings to mind a particular Dickens tale: Great Expectations.</p>

    </div><h3>2012 RUNNER-UP</h3><p>Among people who follow tennis and play it recreationally, Agnieszka Radwanska has built a reputation as somewhat of a must-see player. Clever and nimble, versatile and creative, Radwanska is one of the best tacticians in the sport. Her brand of cat-and-mouse tennis works well on grass, as evidenced by her superb 39–11 Wimbledon match record. The 28-year-old’s affinity for the All England Lawn Tennis &amp; Croquet Club Limited goes back to her teens, when she won the 2005 Wimbledon girls title. At her best, Radwanska skillfully mixes spin and pace, rarely making an unforced error.</p>

    </div><h3>2015 QUARTERFINALIST</h3><p>If you were to build a tennis player with a game perfectly suited for grass, Madison Keys would be your role model. This 22-year-old American has exceptional power, her success fueled by one of the best serves in women’s tennis and anchored with a bold forehand and strong backhand. In four trips to the All England Lawn Tennis &amp; Croquet Club Limited, Keys has won 11 of 15 matches, including a run to the quarterfinals two years ago. Though wrist surgery delayed the start of her 2017 campaign, come Wimbledon time, Keys will be eager to leave her mark on the grass.</p>

    </div><h3>2000, 2001, 2005, 2007, 2008 CHAMPION</h3><p>When it comes to longevity, it’s hard to surpass what Venus Williams has accomplished at Wimbledon. Twenty years ago she made her All England Lawn Tennis &amp; Croquet Club Limited debut, a precocious 17-year-old. In short order, she left a major mark. Between 2000 and 2008, Williams won five Wimbledon singles titles, persistently smothering opponents with excellent movement, reach and the ability to hit the big shot at the right time. But after announcing in 2011 that she had Sjogren’s syndrome, an autoimmune disease, it was hard to imagine a 30-something Williams remaining a major competitive factor. Guess again.</p>
