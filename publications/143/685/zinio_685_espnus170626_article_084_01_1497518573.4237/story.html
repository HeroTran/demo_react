    </div><p>Every day at Wimbledon, Nate Ferguson will pay close attention to the weather report. Ferguson is the founder and owner of Priority One, a company that services rackets for touring pros. Throughout the year, Ferguson and colleagues Ron Yu and Glynn Roberts set up shop near a tournament, stringing and preparing rackets day and night.</p>
<p>Should the forecast call for cooler conditions than usual, the Priority One team likely will string the rackets looser in the quest for more control. If more heat is anticipated, the frame will be strung tighter, permitting greater control.</p>
<p>Weather isn’t the only concern of the Priority One team. Each player’s racket is a carefully tuned instrument, everything from grip size and shape to string tension and frame weight playing an important role. (Four-time Wimbledon champion Rod Laver enjoyed whittling the wood around his grip.) But in recent years, there has been a major shift in the balance between racket and strings.</p>
<p>“It used to be that the racket gave you control and the strings gave you power,” says Andy Gerst, spokesman for Tennis Warehouse. “Now it’s just the opposite.”</p>
<p>The old model: The racket was dead—and heavy. Ivan Lendl reached the ’87 Wimbledon final with a racket that weighed 14.4 ounces, according to Ferguson. The grip was big so that the racket would not twist in the player’s hand. The gut strings were resilient, all the better to generate power.</p>
<p>The new model: The racket is lively—and lighter (Andy Murray’s frame weighs 12.3 ounces). The grip is small so that a player can easily whip the frame through the point of contact. The string is a hybrid of classic gut for feel and new-school dead polyester for power.</p>
<p>Strings in particular have dramatically altered the way professional tennis players strike the ball. A gut-strung racket with a smaller head required players—even those as skilled as Laver, Lendl and seven-time Wimbledon champion Pete Sampras—to carefully calibrate power and control, spin and pace. But these days, larger sweet spots, lighter frames and the dead polyester strings have transformed tennis, making it possible for players to generate tremendous racket-head speed and have it all—tons of spin and pace. No matter what the temperature, look for players at this year’s Wimbledon to make the ball sizzle.</p>
