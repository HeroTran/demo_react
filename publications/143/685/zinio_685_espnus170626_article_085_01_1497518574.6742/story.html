    </div><p><i>Twenty-five years ago, Nick Bollettieri was front and center for one of the most surprising title runs in Wimbledon history. On July 5, 1992, Bollettieri’s longtime student, Andre Agassi, won the championship. Agassi is just one of 10 world No.1 players Bollettieri has worked with, a legacy that earned Bollettieri a spot in the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 2014. The brazen power of those who’ve worked with Bollettieri over the past 40 years goes hand-in-hand with the sport’s increasing physicality. Here is more from a one-of-a-kind tennis legend:</i></p>
<p>Q : When you hear the phrase “tennis has become more physical,” what does that mean to you?</p>
<p>A: It can mean a couple of things. It means that the points are not just bing-bing, but there’s a lot of running, fighting, jumping—grueling movement. It’s very physical. Body, movement and recovery—everything is part of the game today.</p>
<p>Give examples of how that plays out.</p>
<p>Look at Rafael Nadal. What made Nadal? Certainly not beautiful strokes, but he’d grind and grind. He hit that forehand, and then he’d grind. That’s what made him difficult to beat. You know when you play him, you’re in for a battle. It’s almost more like a war. He wasn’t just a tennis player. You were in for it. You’d think you’d hit a winner, but he’d run it down—always using his legs, using his body.</p>
<p>Why has it gotten more physical?</p>
<p>A few reasons. Technology of the rackets and the strings. You have bigger and stronger athletes playing the game. Look at the size—6-2, 6-6, 6-10. The game belongs to the big guy. You don’t see these guys 5-9 and 5-11 up in the spotlight. It doesn’t mean that the little guy doesn’t have a chance. But boy, he better be ready to put in a lot of hard work.</p>
<p>What form did athleticism once take in tennis?</p>
<p>Many years ago, the strokes were longer and prettier. The grips have changed. You go back to Rod Laver and Roy Emerson and even Pete Sampras. Today, you’ve got full Western grips. Look at the full stroke, a big stroke, even in the volleys. The biggest change today is hitting more forehands—and movement. You can’t just wait ’til the ball comes back. Movement and recovery is huge—absolutely more than it used to be.</p>
<p>What kind of athleticism is now required?</p>
<p>It’s a combination of strength, flexibility, movement—but also, some people, like Andre Agassi and Kei Nishikori, are born with eyes, hands and feet. When you’re born with that, and take it to the next level, incredible things can happen. Fitness training has changed. There’s a lot more emphasis on the lower body. Everything starts with the foundation. Yes, the upper-body is important, but you need lower body foundation to better hit the ball so that you use your legs for power and to move into the ball. You get more power from the foundation of your legs—relax, lift up, recover.</p>
<p>What kind of playing style do you see happening in the future as a result of all these changes?</p>
<p>What you’re going to see is a more well-rounded game that will be played on every inch of the tennis court. You’ll see a little more serve-and-volley. The influence of [Grigor] Dimitrov and [Roger] Federeryou might even see a few more one-handers. Still, in the long run, the two-handed backhand has more advantages.</p>
<p>Where do you see physicality going in the years to come?</p>
<p>You’re going to see the serve and the killer forehand are going to become even more important. The forehands will cover even more of the court. The second serves have got to become even more aggressive. You can have size, you can have strength, you can have strings. But if you don’t feel you’re a winner, you’ve still got to believe you’re a winner, and prove it again and again. That’s what being a champion is all about.</p>
