The so-long-in-thetooth- it-qualifies-as-a-fang Mac Pro hasn’t been updated in more than three years, but still commands a hefty price tag. And last fall’s new <a href=\"http://go.macworld.com/mcbkpr\" target=\"_self\">MacBook Pro</a> added the splashy new Touch Bar while seeming to skimp on practicalities like RAM and processor power.</p>\n<p>But all may not be lost! During the recent Apple shareholder meeting, CEO Tim Cook had this cryptic answer to a question about the pro market: “Don’t think something we’ve done or something that we’re doing that isn’t visible yet is a signal that our priorities are elsewhere.” (Or, if I may paraphrase: “Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.”)</p>\n<p>In case that wasn’t clear, he also answered more directly, saying, “You will see us do more in the pro area. The pro area is very important to us. The creative area is very important to us in particular.” But that doesn’t mean Apple is necessarily about to drop a new Mac Pro. Cook’s definition of “pro” is open to interpretation.</p>\n<h3><b>MACS FOR PROS</b></h3><p>Historically, the Mac has been considered the platform of choice for creative professionals. In audio, video, and digital art, the Mac has long had a strong foothold, and so Apple has invested heavily in those areas, buying software companies for example. Logic Pro, Final Cut Pro, Color, and Motion all came out of acquisitions.</p>\n<p>Apple also builds hardware to appeal to professionals in those fields, but in a way that’s consistent with its product design ethos. That’s how we ended up with the Mac Pro redesign of 2013, which, like the new MacBook Pro, perhaps focused more on form than function.</p>\n<p>Given the popularity of laptops, Apple directs most of its attention to portable Macs, revising the MacBook Pro twice during the same period it’s ignored the Mac Pro. But laptops are about balancing power with constraints like heat, battery life, and weight. Apple lacks a real high-performance, no-holds-barred option.</p>\n<h3><b>MAC PRO OR iMAC—OR iPAD?</b></h3><p>The Mac Pro used to be the clear choice for professionals. It had the most powerful processors, the most RAM, the best video card, the biggest storage and expansion options. Yes, it was a beast, but its users wanted power and were OK with the trade-offs.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0011-0133/396184-1-eng-US/f0011-012.jpg\" width=\"763\" height=\"511\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0011-01\" title=\"f0011-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>While there’s a lot to like about Apple’s high-end iMacs, like their high-resolution displays, it’s hard to define any as “no-holds-barred.” More than a few professionals have made the jump from a Pro to an iMac, simply because it’s the only modern option for a powerful Mac desk top. In fact, the iMac has been its flagship desktop Mac for years. Before the 2013 revision, Apple gave the Mac Pro only sporadic speed bump updates—hardly surprising for a machine that makes up a small chunk of sales.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0012-0153/396177-1-eng-US/f0012-012.jpg\" width=\"762\" height=\"471\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0012-01\" title=\"f0012-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>Then there’s the other “pro” machine in Apple’s lineup: the iPad Pro. Apple’s targeting some creative professionals with the device, pitching the Apple Pencil directly to artists. But there’s no argument that the iPad Pro doesn’t service many pro users. Software developers, for example, can’t do their job without iOSbased development tools, and while video- and audio-editing solutions do exist, you’d be hard-pressed to find a professional who finds them an adequate substitution for the tools available on a Mac or PC.</p>\n<p>No, the iPad Pro isn’t ready to satisfy the entire creative pro market, and it’ll be a while before it is. In the meantime, the pro market needs to get work done, and it needs Apple to produce a machine that can do that work. My hope is that whatever Apple has up its sleeves will be a true successor to the Mac Pro, whether an updated version of that 2013 machine or an entirely new design—but there’s a distinct possibility that we’ll get a high-end iMac. Whatever Apple does release will tell us a lot about how the company views the pro market today.</p>\n","layout":{},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":0,"link_source":"","competition":[],"flatplan_title":"","notes":"","gutter_credit":"","other":"","image":[{"id":"e918ee0e265ff1d9539e61c9bd24adc0","name":"mac-pro","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/mac-pro/398059-1-eng-US/mac-pro.jpg?t=default_ipad_portrait&ext/mac-pro_default_ipad_portrait.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"768","height":"455","legacy_id":"26643","is_default":true},{"id":"e918ee0e265ff1d9539e61c9bd24adc0","name":"mac-pro","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/mac-pro/398059-1-eng-US/mac-pro.jpg?t=default_ipad_landscape&ext/mac-pro_default_ipad_landscape.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"1024","height":"607","legacy_id":"26643","is_default":false}],"related_objects":{"image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_2_1492428217.2215","name":"f0012-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0012-0153/396177-1-eng-US/f0012-012.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"762","height":"471","legacy_id":"26454"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_2_1492428217.2215","name":"f0012-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0012-0153/396177-1-eng-US/f0012-012.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"762","height":"471","legacy_id":"26454"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_1_1492428217.7755","name":"f0011-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0011-0133/396184-1-eng-US/f0011-012.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"763","height":"511","legacy_id":"26455"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_1_1492428217.7755","name":"f0011-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0011-0133/396184-1-eng-US/f0011-012.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"763","height":"511","legacy_id":"26455"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1492428218.3358","name":"f0010-01","source":"IMAGE: APPLE","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0010-0155/396191-1-eng-US/f0010-012.jpg?t=default_ipad_portrait&ext/f0010-012_default_ipad_portrait.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"768","height":"674","legacy_id":"26456"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1492428218.3358","name":"f0010-01","source":"IMAGE: APPLE","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0010-0155/396191-1-eng-US/f0010-012.jpg?t=default_ipad_landscape&ext/f0010-012_default_ipad_landscape.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"875","height":"768","legacy_id":"26456"}]},"url_alias":"http://macworld-us.audiencemedia.com","type":"story","order":"0","folio_number":"10","folio_numbers":"10","pdf_page_index":"10","thumbnail":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/mac-pro/398059-1-eng-US/mac-pro.jpg?t=tablet_story_thumbnail&ext/mac-pro_tablet_story_thumbnail.jpg","color":"2699cd","real_id":"28757","main_section_id":"1421","ads":[]},{"id":"99434d5fb5d4fd20ddef650b3619b603","title":"How to adjust macOS Sierra 10.12.4’s Night Shift settings","sub_title":"News and Analysis About Macs, OS X, and Apple","author":[{"id":"0","name":"ROMAN LOYOLA","email":"noreply@audiencemedia.com","is_default":false}],"tag":"","strap_line":"HOW TO ADJUST NIGHT SHIFT SETTINGS","intro":"Properly set the new Night Shift settings in macOS Sierra 10.12.4 and get a good night’s sleep.","body":"<p class=\"byline\"><b>BY ROMAN LOYOLA</b></p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/imac-2/398101-1-eng-US/imac-2.jpg\" width=\"725\" height=\"436\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"imac-2\" title=\"imac-2\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p><b>N</b>ight Shift was first introduced in iOS 9.3. It’s a setting that adjusts your display’s colors when it’s nighttime. When the sun sets, your Mac’s display will use less blue light, creating a picture that’s “warmer.” You’ll notice a yellowish cast on the screen. Night Shift is the major new feature in macOS Sierra 10.12.4. Let’s take a look at what Night Shift does, and how you can adjust it to best suit your Mac habits. </p>\n<p>Apple says many studies show that the blue light usually used by displays can affect your circadian rhythms and your sleep pattern. When you use Night Shift, the warmer colors aren’t as harsh on your eyes and better for your circadian rhythms. Whether this holds true for you or not, you now have the option to use Night Shift.</p>\n<h3><b>WHICH MACS WORK WITH NIGHT SHIFT</b></h3><p>&gt; MacBook Air (Mid 2012 or later)</p>\n<p>&gt; MacBook (Early 2015 or later)</p>\n<p>&gt; MacBook Pro (Mid 2012 or later)</p>\n<p>&gt; Mac mini (Late 2012 or later)</p>\n<p>&gt; iMac (Late 2012 or later)</p>\n<p>&gt; Mac Pro (Late 2013)</p>\n<h3>\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0008-0126/396141-1-eng-US/f0008-012.jpg\" width=\"469\" height=\"351\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0008-01\" title=\"f0008-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div></h3><h3><b>NIGHT SHIFT AND MULTIPLE DISPLAYS</b></h3><p>If you have multiple displays, Night Shift works only on the display that you use as your primary display. If you don’t see the Night Shift option for the display you want, you need to make it the primary. To set your primary display:</p>\n<p>&gt; Click on the Arrangement tab in the Displays system preference.</p>\n<p>&gt; Click on the menu bar and drag it to the desired display.</p>\n<p>Night Shift works with connected displays, such as Apple’s Thunderbolt Display. It does not work with projectors or televisions.</p>\n<h3><b>HOW TO TURN NIGHT SHIFT ON</b></h3><p>Night Shift is part of the Display system preference. Here’s how to turn it on.</p>\n<p>&gt; In the Apple menu, select System Preferences.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0009-0126/396134-1-eng-US/f0009-012.jpg\" width=\"476\" height=\"356\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0009-01\" title=\"f0009-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>&gt; Click on Diplays.</p>\n<p>&gt; Click on the Night Shift tab, which will be on the far right.</p>\n<p>The Schedule pop-up menu is where you turn Night Shift on or off.

The default is 10 p.m. to 7 a.m.</p>\n<p>&gt; <b>Sunset To Sunrise:</b> Night Shift changes the color temperature based on the time of sunset and sunrise in your area.</p>\n<p>With the Off and Custom settings, you have a manual option that activates Night Shift immediately. Check the box for Turn On Until Tomorrow and Night Shift switches to the warmer color space, regardless of the current time of day. It will switch back to the blue color space after 24 hours.</p>\n<p>With the Sunrise To Sunset setting, there is also a manual option that activates Night Shift immediately, but this setting switches the color space back at sunrise.</p>\n<h3><b>ADJUST THE COLOR TEMPERATURE</b></h3><p>Within the Off, Custom, and Sunrise To Sunset settings is a slider for color temperature. You can set Night Shift to be Less Warm or More Warm. When you slide toward Less Warm, more blue light is used. Slide toward More Warm and less blue light is used.

While you may never get the chance to play the new Zelda on your computer, there is a surprising connection here: the <a href=\"http://go.macworld.com/jcmac\" target=\"_self\">Joy-Con controllers </a>can pair with your Mac.</p>\n<p>That’s right: the little control nubs that bookend either side of the Switch’s screen detach from the unit, and since they pair via Bluetooth, you can use them with Mac games. We certainly wouldn’t recommend buying a Switch solely to use the Joy-Cons on your Mac, but if you game across multiple devices and snagged the console, then Mac compatibility is a sweet perk. And the Switch’s beefier Pro Controller works with macOS, as well.</p>\n<p>Want to wield some Nintendo hardware with your Mac? Here’s how to get set up, how well it all works, and why you should even bother.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0014-0156/396248-1-eng-US/f0014-012.jpg\" width=\"767\" height=\"498\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0014-01\" title=\"f0014-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>The Joy-Cons slide right off the Switch, and then you can attach the optional strap piece that makes them larger and enhances the shoulder buttons.</b></p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>HOW IT WORKS</b></h3><p>As first spotted by software engineer <a href=\"http://go.macworld.com/stimply\" target=\"_self\">Sam Williams</a> the pairing of Switch controllers to your Mac is surprisingly effortless. Just hold down the little pairing button on the top of either Joy-Con, open up Bluetooth preferences on your Mac, and you should be able to pair the devices right away. Now you have a Nintendo-made Mac controller.</p>\n<p>Each Joy-Con registers as its own controller, however, and unless someone creates a software solution to enable it, they can’t be used together simultaneously as a single unit on the Mac. That’s a big limitation, since each Joy-Con acts like half a controller: it has one analog stick and four primary face buttons, along with two small shoulder buttons. And since you’re holding it sideways, the additional shoulder and trigger buttons on the lower left or right side won’t really come into play.</p>\n<p>On the Switch, you have different kinds of configurations. The two Joy-Con pads can be used simultaneously, either attached to the screen or held separately, but each can also be used individually for multiplayer games. For example, you’ll be able to throw down in the new <i>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</i> with two players each wielding a single Joy-Con. And that’s essentially the experience you get on the Mac: a Joy-Con, held sideways, with a limited array of inputs.</p>\n<p>As such, you’ll have to choose carefully when it comes to games. Most 3D games are going to be too complex to work with a single analog stick, so skip the first-person shooters. I fired up Steam and had a look at my library, and found that it was a perfect fit for tower defense great <i>PixelJunk Monsters Ultimate</i> (go.macworld. com/pxjk), one of my all-time favorite PlayStation games that was ported to the Mac. After playing with the in-game bindings, I was dropping towers and running around with ease. It felt fantastic. Same with <a href=\"http://go.macworld.com/140\" target=\"_self\"><i>140</i></a>, an inventive, ultra-minimal side-scrolling platform game.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0015-0145/396241-1-eng-US/f0015-012.jpg\" width=\"1346\" height=\"873\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0015-01\" title=\"f0015-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>Each Joy-Con functions independently, but hopefully some enterprising soul gives us a way to use them in tandem.</b></p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p class=\"pullQuote\">Most 3D games are going to be too complex to work with a single analog stick, so skip the first-person shooters.</p>\n<p>Truth be told, the Joy-Cons are absolutely perfect for emulating old-school games. The legality of emulation is a sticky subject, but if you own the original game, you’re entitled to have a backup ROM. Using the Joy-Con with <a href=\"https://openemu.org\" target=\"_self\">OpenEmu</a> was a total breeze, and within moments I was immersed in Super Nintendo classics like <i>The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past</i> and <i>Super Mario Kart</i> like I was a kid again. Even a 3D legend like Super Mario 64 played well with the Joy-Con, although I lacked enough buttons to have manual camera control.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0016-0157/396234-1-eng-US/f0016-012.jpg\" width=\"537\" height=\"378\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0016-01\" title=\"f0016-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>Spend a minute mapping the buttons in OpenEmu, and you’ll be playing retro classics with the Joy-Con.</b></p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>WHY YOU’D BOTHER</b></h3><p>Emulation has never been a strong personal interest, as I always felt like you lost something in the transition—but playing classic Nintendo games using actual Nintendo hardware really helped bridge the gap. It was a seamless experience, and I think it’ll be one of the biggest draws for using the Joy-Con controllers on a Mac. That’s especially true since Nintendo released the Switch without its Virtual Console service for selling retro games (it’s coming eventually), so you won’t be playing those on the actual device for now.</p>\n<p>If you don’t already have a Mac-compatible gamepad, then the Joy-Con is certainly better than nothing. It’ll work with some games, but obviously not all of them given the lack of a second analog stick and additional buttons. And even for those who already have a fully-featured Mac controller, like the SteelSeries Stratus, the Joy-Cons have other advantages.</p>\n<p>For example, they’re super tiny and even pocket-sized, so you’d have a lot less to carry around if you’re traveling with a MacBook. If you’re packing your Switch and MacBook for a trip, you can easily swap between the devices with ease without needing to pack a separate Mac gamepad. Just be sure to consider what kinds of games you plan on playing on your Mac before you decide to ditch the full-sized gamepad.</p>\n<p>And actually, if you bring your Switch, you’ll have not just one Mac gamepad on hand, but two—both Joy-Cons can be paired at the same time and used with applicable games. I fired up <i>Super Mario Kart</i> in OpenEmu and was able to throw down in two-player split-screen using both gamepads. They may not be robust controllers, but for simple two-player fun, they’ll do the trick.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0017-0134/396227-1-eng-US/f0017-012.jpg\" width=\"536\" height=\"527\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0017-01\" title=\"f0017-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>Multiplayer Mario Kart on your Mac? Yes, please.</b></p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>GO PRO?</b></h3><p>Given Nintendo’s use of Bluetooth for Switch controllers, it makes sense that the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Pro-Controller/dp/B01NAWKYZ0?tag=macworld05-20&amp;SubscriptionId=AKIAIRZJHSP2SKQIWVZA&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;camp=2025&amp;creative=165953&amp;creativeASIN=B01NAWKYZ0\" target=\"_self\">Switch Pro Controller</a> also pairs swiftly with the Mac using the exact same process. The Pro Controller looks and acts much like an Xbox One or Xbox 360 controller, with two analog sticks, a directional pad, and a full complement of face, shoulder, and trigger buttons. It’s also pricey at $70, yet currently near-impossible to find, since it’s such a benefit for playing Zelda on your TV.</p>\n<p>In any case, if you have a Switch Pro Controller, you might as well use it on the Mac, right? As with the Joy-Cons, it worked perfectly with OpenEmu and its highly-customizable control schemes. It also played nicely with <i>PixelJunk Monsters</i> again, and once I created a gamepad profile within Steam, I was able to use it for the awesome <a href=\"https://rocketleague.com\" target=\"_self\"><i>Rocket League</i></a>, as well as oddball gem <a href=\"https://octodadgame.com\" target=\"_self\"><i>Octodad: Dadliest Catch</i></a> and indie blaster <a href=\"https://luftrausers.com\" target=\"_self\"><i>Luftrausers</i></a>.</p>\n<p>Yet I ran into issues with other games that offer gamepad support, but wouldn’t recognize the Pro Controller. That was the case with everything from <a href=\"https://nuclearthrone.com\" target=\"_self\"><i>Nuclear Throne</i></a> to <a href=\"https://gonehome.game/\" target=\"_self\"><i>Gone Home</i></a>, <a href=\"http://guacamelee.com/\" target=\"_self\"><i>Guacamelee</i></a>, and Valve’s classic <a href=\"http://www.valvesoftware.com/games/portal.html\" target=\"_self\"><i>Portal</i></a>, even with gamepad schemes engaged in the options. Your experience may vary, and perhaps it’s something that’ll improve over time as the Switch Pro Controller lands in more homes.</p>\n<h3><b>BOTTOM LINE</b></h3><p>The frustrations were, well, frustrating— but being able to wield a full gamepad for <i>Rocket League</i> and other Mac games made it worth the minimal hassle. If you snagged a Switch and also do a bit of gaming on your Mac, you have little to lose by quickly pairing a Joy-Con and/or Pro Controller and seeing what works well.

It requires a lot of sacrifices and the willingness to accept near-constant change. When my partner and I moved into our RV, it was easy to rid ourselves of unneeded clothing and furniture, but we couldn’t leave behind the computer gear we need to do our jobs. And suddenly I was on the market for a really small printer.</p>\n<p>After using the <a href=\"https://www.usa.canon.com/internet/portal/us/home/products/details/printers/inkjet-single-function/ip-series/ip110?sourcePath=ip110\" target=\"_self\">Canon Pixma iP110</a> portable inkjet printer for a few months, I feel comfortable recommending it to anyone who needs a portable printer. It doesn’t have a scanner, which is fine since I can use my iPhone camera and apps like Scanner Pro, but it’s more than capable of handling the documents, photos, and envelopes I need to print from the road.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0020-0165/396312-1-eng-US/f0020-012.jpg\" width=\"867\" height=\"316\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0020-01\" title=\"f0020-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>When not in use, the doors on the iP110 can be closed, making for easier storage.</b></p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>TINY BUT MIGHTY</b></h3><p>Picking up the iP110, you’ll be surprised that its compact body (12.7 by 7.3 by 2.5 inches) still weighs close to five pounds. All that weight jammed into such a tiny printer is good news, however—this thing is rock solid. After a few months of being slammed around in a storage cupboard with other pieces of hardware and test samples, the iP110 still performs as well as the day I unboxed it.</p>\n<p>Setting up the printer is easy. Plug it into the wall or charge up its optional lithium ion battery (more on that in a minute), and you’ll be well underway. The iP110 can connect wirelessly to your home network via PictBridge Wireless LAN (IEEE 802.11b/g/n) or kick it old school with a USB connection. No matter how you choose to connect, mating it to work with your computer is a breeze, thanks to Canon’s setup wizard. I was able to get my printer up and running both wirelessly and via USB without any difficulties. After installing the iP110’s software and drivers, you’ll be set to start printing from your Mac or an iOS device using AirPrint.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0021-0145/396305-1-eng-US/f0021-012.jpg\" width=\"483\" height=\"333\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0021-01\" title=\"f0021-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>Canon’s drivers and software installed just fine under the latest version of macOS.</b></p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>HOW’S IT WORK?</b></h3><p>Completed print jobs on the iP110 look pretty good. At a maximum DPI of 600x600, the black-and-white documents I print most often are always crisp and highly legible. On the odd occasion where I want a hard copy of a photo I’ve taken, the printer’s 9600x2400 DPI color photo resolution (borderless, no less) is a treat. That it can print anything from envelopes to legal-sized documents is an added perk.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0021-0219/396298-1-eng-US/f0021-022.jpg\" width=\"484\" height=\"301\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0021-02\" title=\"f0021-02\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>Whether bought separately or in a package deal with the printer, the iP110’s battery will cost you about $100.</b></p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>The iP110’s auto sheet feeder can handle roughly 50 sheets at a time, but you might want to throw less into its paper tray, depending on the paper weight you’re using. The same goes for photo paper. Its document handling after completing a print job is something of a letdown, though. The iP110 has no paper tray to catch documents after they’ve been run through the printer. Instead, the printer simply spits spent pages out the other end. That might be fine for small print jobs, but I’ve found that if I’m printing more than five or six pages, I need to move my printed pages to the side. If I don’t, the pages coming out of the printer mix in with the rest of my printing instead of stacking on top. That sucks.</p>\n\n<div>\n<table bgcolor=\"#eeeeee\">\n<tr>\n    <td>\n    <h3>CANON PIXMA IP110 WIRELESS MOBILE PRINTER</h3><h3>\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/3.5mice8/397976-1-eng-US/3.5mice.png\" width=\"271\" height=\"144\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"3.5mice\" title=\"3.5mice\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div></h3><h4><b>AT A GLANCE</b></h4><p>If you need something portable or just compact, this will get the job done—just be ready to pay for the convenience of being able to print anywhere.</p>\n<h4><b>PROS</b></h4><p>• Compact printer handles everything from legal size to envelopes to photos.</p>\n<h4><b>CONS</b></h4><p>• Ink cartridges and optional battery pack are expensive.</p>\n<h4><b>PRICE</b></h4><p>$155</p>\n\n    </td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n</div><p>And then there’s the price.</p>\n<p>On its own, the iP110 <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Wireless-Mobile-Printer-Airprint-Compatible/dp/B00NV9LL9Q/ref=sr_1_1?tag=macworld05-20&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1488858776&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=iP110\" target=\"_self\">sells for $150</a>.

</div><p><b>I</b>’m not a fan of Apple keyboards. There’s nothing wrong with them technically. I just don’t like the way they feel. But I put up with them and over time, my dislike for them has lessened.</p>\n<p>For the past few weeks, I’ve (mostly) ditched the Apple keyboard for the new <a href=\"http://www.lofree.co/\" target=\"_self\">Lofree Mechanical Keyboard</a>. What I found is that my frequent use of the Apple keyboard influenced my experience with the Lofree to mixed results.</p>\n<h3><b>A DIFFERENT FEEL</b></h3><p>The Lofree keyboard is being marketed as being “inspired by typewriters.” Instead of square keys (like those found on Apple and other keyboards), the Lofree’s keys are round, like those you’d find on a typewriter. The round keys are also slightly concave, not flat like the Apple keyboard keys, so your fingertips nestle in nicely. The Lofree is a mechanical keyboard, and there’s a satisfying click when you press a key followed by subtle spring-back action.</p>\n<p>Because I mostly use Apple keyboards, I have an issue when using the Lofree that may or may not happen to you. The Lofree keys have more travel (how deep you have to press the keys) than the keys on the Apple keyboard—a lot more travel. As a result, I encounter hand fatigue while using the Lofree, even after only a couple of hours of writing. The more I use the Lofree, the more my hands become “in shape” and the longer I can go before I have to go back to using the Apple keyboard. But after a few weeks of use, I’m still switching from the Lofree keyboard to the Apple one when my hands start to ache.</p>\n\n<div>\n<table bgcolor=\"#eeeeee\">\n<tr>\n    <td>\n    <h3>LOFREE KEYBOARD</h3>\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/3mice3/397997-1-eng-US/3mice.png\" width=\"215\" height=\"144\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"3mice\" title=\"3mice\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h4><b>PROS</b></h4><p>• Attractive and unique</p>\n<p>• Sturdy</p>\n<p>• Can connect up to three devices at a time via Bluetooth</p>\n<h4><b>CONS</b></h4><p>• Row of number keys shifted to the right of standard keyboard design</p>\n<p>• Might be too noisy for some shared work environments</p>\n\n    </td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n</div><p>Maybe your hands aren’t wimpy like mine, and you won’t have the same problem with hand fatigue.

But typing on a Lofree is much noisier. I actually like its sound, but I’m from a generation that grew up with typewriters and noisy computer keyboards. People have remarked to me on how noisy the Lofree is, enough so that I’m conscious about it in my workplace.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0025-0148/396355-1-eng-US/f0025-012.jpg\" width=\"591\" height=\"451\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0025-01\" title=\"f0025-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>The arrow keys on the Lofree keyboard (left) and the Apple Extended Keyboard (right).</b></p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>The one vexing problem I have with the Lofree is the key layout, especially with the row of number keys. This row is misaligned, so, for example, the 1/! key on the Lofree is to the upper right of the Q key, and the `/~ key is to the upper left. On the Apple keyboard (and many other non- Apple keyboards I’ve seen), the 1/! key is to the upper left of the Q key. At first, I would type the wrong numbers/characters, but now I stop to look at the keyboard when I need to use this row of keys. For anyone who relies on touch typing to get their work done, this is a deal-breaker.</p>\n<p>Then there are the arrow keys. I often tap the Shift key when I mean to tap the Up Arrow key. Also, in order to use the top row of keys as function keys, you have to press the Lofree’s Fn key.</p>\n<p>So, using the Lofree keyboard takes some getting used to if you’ve been using Apple keyboards. You have to adjust to the mechanics of the keys, the sound, and the key layout. Is it worth it? The Lofree is available with early adopter pricing on<a href=\"https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/lofree-typewriter-inspired-mechanical-keyboard-design-technology?sourcePath=lofr#/\" target=\"_self\"> Indiegogo for $74</a>, which isn’t a bad price for a wireless keyboard. Apple’s Magic Keyboard is $99, which will be the regular price of the Lofree when the Indiegogo campaign is done.</p>\n<h3><b>BOTTOM LINE</b></h3><p>The Lofree typewriter-inspired mechanical keyboard provides a different and unique look to your keyboard setup. It’s an attractive and sturdy keyboard with a personality of its own. If you do decide to use it regularly, you’ll need to make adjustments to your typing technique, especially if you’re an Apple keyboard user.</p>\n","layout":{},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":0,"link_source":"","competition":[],"flatplan_title":"","notes":"","gutter_credit":"","other":"","image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1492428229.4952","name":"f0023-01","source":"IMAGE:

The software is funky and inconsistent, as I’ve found on two different Macs (though it runs fine on others in my family’s network). And it uses a proprietary format for archiving. ChronoSync is a fantastic option, but so deeply and comprehensively fleshed out, I’m afraid that it requires a relatively high amount of sophistication to use it well. I’ve spent many hours with it and have mastered it, but it’s too high a burden for more casual users.</p>\n\n<div>\n<table bgcolor=\"#eeeeee\">\n<tr>\n    <td>\n    <h3><b>ARQ</b></h3>\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/4mice20/398004-1-eng-US/4mice.png\" width=\"289\" height=\"144\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"4mice\" title=\"4mice\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h4><b>PROS</b></h4><p>• Simplified interface accessible to most users</p>\n<p>• Works with flat-rate and high-capacity fixed-rate cloud data services</p>\n<p>• Includes data/cost budget to thin archives automatically</p>\n<p>• Lifetime software update for $30 extra</p>\n<h4><b>CONS</b></h4><p>• Needs to overhaul its restore process to improve selection and file version differentiation</p>\n\n    </td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n</div><p>This is where <a href=\"https:/www.arqbackup.com\" target=\"_self\">Arq</a> comes in—and stands out. The affordably priced backup software ($50) is native, more reliable and easier to use than CrashPlan, more focused on backups and simpler than ChronoSync, and has a unique twist: it can back up data to Amazon’s consumer-focused Amazon Cloud Drive service. Amazon’s data hosting costs a flat $60 a year for unlimited storage, making it competitive with Backblaze, CrashPlan, and other hosted services. Arq can also back up to Dropbox, Google Drive, and OneDrive, which some people may already be paying for, and which don’t charge for moving data in and out. While ChronoSync can archive to cloud services, it currently works only with those that charge for data transferred and data stored.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0028-0161/396447-1-eng-US/f0028-012.jpg?t=web480&ext/f0028-012_web480.jpg\" width=\"480\" height=\"364\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0028-01\" title=\"f0028-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>Browsing backups works better than searching for files, but you can’t make multiple selections, among other awkwardness.</b></p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>I ran Arq through its paces with several cloud storage services, local storage, and networked storage. (Arq also comes in a native Windows version, which I didn’t test, but has feature parity.)</p>\n<h3><b>A BASIC BACKUP WITH ACCESSIBLE OPTIONS</b></h3><p>Arq is closest to Backblaze, or even Apple’s long-ago Backups app, in terms of reducing complexity and focusing on documents. For straightforward backups with a history of revisions, Arq requires just selecting folders and one or more destinations. You can dig in a little deeper to exclude certain directories or kinds of files or customize a backup schedule and other parameters by destination.</p>\n<p>I’d say Time Machine is even simpler, but Time Machine offers effectively no options, and Apple’s built-in archiver is meant to offer a complete restoration of a disk as well as the ability to select older versions of modified files. Arq is not a cloner: you’ll want to use Time Machine, SuperDuper, Carbon Copy Cloner, or the cloning mode in ChronoSync for that purpose.</p>\n<p>In the simplest setup, you follow these steps:</p>\n<p>&gt; Set up a backup destination (see the “Choose backup destinations” section).</p>\n<p>&gt; Choose a password that you carefully store somewhere (more on that in the “Encryption” section).</p>\n<p>&gt; Agree to a prompt to back up your Home folder.</p>\n<p>&gt; Walk away.</p>\n<p>It then just runs hourly indefinitely. Arq stores incremental backups, uploading only changed chunks of files, and can restore by reassembling pieces across time that relate to the version you want. This is a common strategy. You can change the interval and times of day when a backup runs or set it to run only on a manual request.</p>\n<p>You aren’t limited to your Home folder: you can back up any folder you select, although because of its approach in backing up, I’d recommend avoiding system files, which is true of many backup programs that don’t perform a full clone operation.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0030-0165/396440-1-eng-US/f0030-012.jpg\" width=\"769\" height=\"422\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0030-01\" title=\"f0030-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>The search results for checking backups doesn’t provide enough information to choose among different versions.</b></p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>When it adds your Home folder, Arq excludes the same files and locations as Time Machine. But you can configure your own exclusions by unchecking files and folders in a browser list. You can also use one or more matching conditions for file/folder names as well as regular expressions used on the full file path.</p>\n<p>As you add folders by destination, they appear in a simple list at left under Configure Backups. Beneath that, there’s a corresponding set of entries for Restore Files. Each backup appears under a folder for both Configure and Restore showing the backup dates.</p>\n<h3><b>RESTORATION NEEDS AN UPGRADE</b></h3><p>Restoring files is a little chunkier than backing up, and more sophisticated software often has better options to assemble a set of items to retrieve. With Arq, you either drill down through a source to a folder to a given date-and-time backup, and then browse a folder and file hierarchy, or you can search across all backups. In search results, Arq only shows a file path, like <b>/Users/Home/billg/Documents/dog1.jpg</b> instead of a more friendly icon-based hierarchy, and it doesn’t reveal from which backup each file or folder comes in the list.</p>\n<p>If you browse through a given backup set from a destination, Arq labels folders and files changed, added, or deleted since the last backup, and labels all files with the last modified date, whether they were modified or not. However, when you search, the only information that shows is the date and time of the backup of which the result is part, and the backup source isn’t identified, either. This is subpar.</p>\n<p>While Arq’s selection options are frankly just about as clunky and frustrating as most other backup client software, its biggest flaw is that you can only select one file or folder at a time, either for dragging to the Finder (where it restores in the place you dragged) or using the Restore button, which offers to overwrite or restore into a separate folder in the original location from which files were backed up.</p>\n<p>Even that overwrite/write-alongside option is confusing: the dialog offers Do Not Overwrite, Cancel, and Overwrite, while the text explains that Arq is “downloading and replacing only the modified and missing files with the files from the backup.” That’s only true with Overwrite; click Do Not Overwrite, and Arq puts the entire selection in a folder in that nested location. This is good behavior, but explained poorly.</p>\n<p>Arq desperately needs multiple selections and noncontiguous ones, as well as other ways to retrieve files besides dragging and overwriting. Other software and services have varying approaches that make it easier to get to the right place at the right time.</p>\n<p>It’s primarily for a failure to have richer and more robust restore options that I gave Arq four mice instead of five.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0031-0149/396433-1-eng-US/f0031-012.jpg\" width=\"549\" height=\"147\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0031-01\" title=\"f0031-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>The overwrite dialog for restoring files doesn’t fully explain all the outcomes.</b></p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>CHOOSE BACKUP DESTINATIONS</b></h3><p>Beyond simplicity, Arq’s best point is supporting so many different kinds of backup destinations. As noted at the outset, it works with conventional cloud-storage offerings, Amazon S3 and Google Cloud Storage, which effectively charge for data transfer and then lease you storage on a per-gigabyte monthly pro-rated basis.</p>\n<p>But Arq also connects with Amazon Cloud Drive (unlimited storage for $60 a year), paid tiers of Dropbox (1TB, 2TB, and unlimited flavors from $8.25 to $20 per month), Google Drive (1TB for $10 a month), and Microsoft OneDrive (1TB for $6 a month). Many people, through work or for personal use, already have a cloud subscription, and Arq lets you leverage what you’re already paying instead of adding another monthly or yearly fee on top.</p>\n<p>Arq can also connect to any server that supports SFTP (Secure FTP), a long-available secured file-transfer protocol built on top of SSH (Secure Shell) for remote server access. It’s part of macOS’s Remote Access service in the Sharing system preference pane. And Arq can back up to any folder or volume you can select through a standard dialog box, which includes NAS devices and other Macs over AFP or SMB.</p>\n<p>This diversity of options and the ability to work with Amazon Cloud Drive puts Arq above the pack. While many hosted backup services cost between $4 to $6 per month per computer for unlimited storage, they control all remote access to your files, and all of them only back up to their own data stores.</p>\n<p>Arq has some nice subtleties in how you work with destination cloud services, letting you choose among different tiers of Amazon and Google’s usage-based storage services that are priced based on how frequently you might need to retrieve the data. Arq puts a friendly interface particularly in front of Amazon Glacier, an appropriately named “cold storage” service that’s meant for essentially long-term reliable storage of data you may never need to retrieve. Retrieval costs with Glacier vary, too, and Arq lets you select among three options.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0032-0161/396426-1-eng-US/f0032-012.jpg\" width=\"521\" height=\"405\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0032-01\" title=\"f0032-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>Arq provides access and cost insight into usage-based cloud-storage options.</b></p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>And in what is a fantastic option for managing storage limits and costs, you can set a backup budget in storage size or cost: Arq will cull pieces of files related to older versions when you exceed the budget, but will also ensure it has one complete backup, even if it goes over that total. The monetary cost appears for backup methods that charge in units and for which Arq can calculate storage costs; otherwise, you see a storage limit. You can set an interval during which to enforce the budget and perform a manual cull.</p>\n<p>A common scenario is when you have large files that you modify frequently enough and that use a data storage format that ripples changes throughout. A 100MB file could balloon to occupy tens of gigabytes or more over time if you don’t cull past versions.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0033-0138/396419-1-eng-US/f0033-012.jpg\" width=\"440\" height=\"551\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0033-01\" title=\"f0033-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>Every destination can have settings for frequency and time of day set, as well as a data or cost budget and thinning interval.</b></p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>You can also set a global preference in Arq → Preferences → Advanced called Thin Backups From Hourly To Daily To Weekly. On each backup, Arq retains no more than one backup per week per file, one month worth of daily backups, and one day of hourly backups. With a budget enabled, that culling also happens in reverse order from weekly to daily to hourly to stay within the budget.</p>\n<p>On the throughput side, it’s hard to provide a precise answer. I have gigabit Internet, and was able to see 100 Mbps to 200 Mbps throughput for uploading files to top-tier cloud destinations, which is impressive given the degree of scanning and encryption involved. Amazon Cloud Backup was about a tenth as fast as Amazon S3, which is not a surprise given the market for each service. For locally connected storage, I seemed to max out at 100 Mbps over USB 3.0 to a hard drive, which is far below the drive’s top rate. (You can set a network throttle in preferences, and tell Arq to use only certain network interfaces and Wi-Fi networks, too.)</p>\n<p>Arq’s one flaw in backup locations is that it doesn’t store credentials (all the login information) separately from destinations. If you’re using different kinds of storage at Amazon S3 or Google Cloud Storage, or different folders for SFTP, you have to go through the login process each time. That could be simplified with a credentials manager, used by file-transfer software like Transmit and Arq quasi-competitor ChronoSync. I suspect, however, most Arq users aren’t using lots of locations at the same service. And the pain is one time: once set up, you don’t have to repeat it.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0034-0165/396412-1-eng-US/f0034-012.jpg\" width=\"366\" height=\"450\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0034-01\" title=\"f0034-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>Arq can avoid backing up to certain Wi-Fi networks (and certain network interfaces, not shown).</b></p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>ENCRYPTION</b></h3><p>Several hosted backup services let you “own” your encryption keys, but some of those transmit the keys (in a secure fashion) to their servers, which handle part of the encryption or decryption process for backing up and restoring. Not controlling your keys or having them transmitted to a server for any reason puts your data security at risk from hackers, vandals, and governments (your own and others). It’s a set of trade-offs. (I wrote extensively about these trade-offs in September 2016.)</p>\n<p>All data is encrypted by Arq before it leaves your computer or before it’s stored locally in a folder using standard encryption elements, similar to the git versioncontrol system. (You can read the full details.) It seems well conceived to me.</p>\n<p>You pick a passphrase each time you start using a destination. The passphrase can be identical across all your destinations or re-used across some or all. The app generates random keys for encryption for each destination, and then encrypts those keys using your passphrase, which is transformed through an algorithm into an encryption key. That encrypted file with the destination keys is stored with the backup.</p>\n<p>Your passphrase is stored in Keychain and accessed by Arq and its background agent as needed. You can unlock Keychain with your login password to view Arq passphrases. So long as you can recover your passphrases if your computer or startup drive were lost, stolen, or destroyed, you can restore the corresponding Arq backups. Lose the passphrases, though, and your backup is locked away forever.</p>\n<p>The only vulnerability here is while your Mac is running, someone who could gain access to an active session on your computer could potentially grab your encryption keys. That’s a risk with all locally controlled encryption, however, and not unique to Arq. And having all the keys decrypted only locally, never transmitted and never used on remote servers, vastly reduces the potential of them being obtained.</p>\n<h3><b>COMPARING WITH TIME MACHINE, CRASHPLAN, AND CHRONOSYNC</b></h3><p>The real test of Arq is whether it fits users’ needs where other backup software and services fall short.</p>\n<p><b>Time Machine.</b> I don’t have to recount to most people the troubles with Time Machine. While it has grown increasingly reliable, release after release, it’s not configurable. And when a backup fails, it often corrupts silently and with little recourse. Time Capsule is even worse, in that you can’t access the drive directly, and many people have written me about an entire Mac’s worth of Time Machine backups being flushed from Time Capsule.</p>\n<p>Several third-party Time Machine utilities that let you control its function better have fallen by the wayside, and it’s now difficult to impossible to choose specific folders or files to back up, set a schedule, or control archive depth.</p>\n<p>Time Machine also omits encryption. If your Time Machine target is an encrypted volume, it’s secure at rest (unmounted), but files are written in the clear. Finally, Time Machine only backs up to local drives and networked volumes.</p>\n<p><b>CrashPlan.</b> CrashPlan should be a viable alternative, based on features. CrashPlan lets people back up at no cost locally or to a networked or peer’s Mac or Windows system running a CrashPlan client. It also lets you pick your own encryption key (in two different variants), controlling ownership of your encryption. It offers great file and folder selection. Its flat-rate unlimited cloud backup is reasonably priced for individuals and families.</p>\n<p>However, the CrashPlan Java client for home users is a sticking point. It’s not reliable, fast, or easy to use, although its restore feature is far superior to the current state of Arq’s restore. Mac users shouldn’t install or use Java, even in the restricted form that’s packaged with CrashPlan.</p>\n<p>CrashPlan also backs up to a proprietary format, even locally, and can’t pick other cloud destinations.</p>\n<p><b>ChronoSync.</b> ChronoSync combines some of the best options of cloning software and Time Machine, and has many similar advantages to Arq. However, its complexity best maps to those who really need to dig into the options and learn them. You can create extraordinary layers of archives and exclusions and schedules. It’s definitely over the top for average users, even when you try to choose the kind of sync option from a pop-up menu. I’m very glad the app exists, but I can’t recommend it broadly.</p>\n<p>ChronoSync also isn’t built around encryption. The only option to use encryption is with Amazon S3 and Google Cloud Storage, and only using limited server-side options that I don’t recommend.</p>\n<p>The app is best for people who have very specific and sometimes elaborate needs.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0036-0163/396405-1-eng-US/f0036-012.jpg\" width=\"584\" height=\"193\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0036-01\" title=\"f0036-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>You set your own passphrase for each destination’s encryption keys.</b></p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>BOTTOM LINE</b></h3><p>Arq seems to hit several sweet spots for folks who want to own their encryption fully and control more of their backup process, including having identical or different local and cloud archives.</p>\n<p>The initial setup isn’t painful, and there’s so little configuration, I can recommend it to users who feel overwhelmed with some of the competing options. Its ability to work with Dropbox and Amazon Cloud Backup provide reasonable alternatives to other cloud-based backup services.</p>\n<p>If Arq seems too thin to you, I recommend ChronoSync, which offers a staggering array of options and customization. But for most people, Arq should provide the right combination of power, simplicity, one-time cost, and ongoing hosted data costs.</p>\n","layout":{},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":0,"link_source":"","competition":[],"flatplan_title":"","notes":"","gutter_credit":"","other":"","image":[{"id":"a12d5ea0bf7463964a931a340ed54e4c","name":"arq","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/arq/398066-1-eng-US/arq.jpg?t=default_ipad_portrait&ext/arq_default_ipad_portrait.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"768","height":"495","legacy_id":"26644","is_default":true},{"id":"a12d5ea0bf7463964a931a340ed54e4c","name":"arq","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/arq/398066-1-eng-US/arq.jpg?t=default_ipad_landscape&ext/arq_default_ipad_landscape.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"1024","height":"659","legacy_id":"26644","is_default":false}],"related_objects":{"image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_8_1492428231.0328","name":"f0028-02","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0028-0238/396398-1-eng-US/f0028-022.jpg?t=default_ipad_portrait&ext/f0028-022_default_ipad_portrait.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"768","height":"356","legacy_id":"26481"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_8_1492428231.0328","name":"f0028-02","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0028-0238/396398-1-eng-US/f0028-022.jpg?t=default_ipad_landscape&ext/f0028-022_default_ipad_landscape.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"1024","height":"474","legacy_id":"26481"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_7_1492428231.7278","name":"f0036-01","source":"","caption":"<p><b>You

Compatibility updates aside, could there be any newer features worth adding?</p>\n<h3><b>COLOR WHEEL</b></h3><p>Judging from iScrapbook 7 ($50 single user; $90 family pack) the answer is yes, as this impressive update arrives with a singular focus on color. The change is apparent throughout the user interface, most notably with the addition of a new color wheel that allows users to discover complementary color combinations by using techniques familiar to artists.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0038-0164/396504-1-eng-US/f0038-012.jpg\" width=\"775\" height=\"512\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0038-01\" title=\"f0038-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>The new color wheel offers a limitless number of choices for embellishing any scrapbook project.</b></p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>The edit window is split into three sections: At left, Photoshop-style base color sliders for red, green, blue plus hue, saturation, and brightness; the color wheel itself in the center, which can be displayed in traditional (RYB) or modern (RGB) primary views; and saved color schemes on the right side, which are accessible throughout the application.</p>\n\n<div>\n<table bgcolor=\"#eeeeee\">\n<tr>\n    <td>\n    <h3>iSCRAPBOOK 7</h3>\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/4.5mice14/398011-1-eng-US/4.5mice.png\" width=\"345\" height=\"144\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"4.5mice\" title=\"4.5mice\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h4><b>PROS</b></h4><p>• Create unlimited number of custom color schemes</p>\n<p>• Photo analyzer determines dominant colors in selected image</p>\n<p>• Color wheel with 11 built-in combinations</p>\n<h4><b>CONS</b></h4><p>• New features limited to color</p>\n<p>• Analyze results disappear when deselecting photo</p>\n\n    </td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n</div><p>Several presets are included, but it’s super-easy to create your own in a few clicks. That’s because iScrapbook 7 introduces the ability to analyze inserted photos and quickly create a custom color palette from its dominant colors. This is done by first selecting the photo, browsing to Image → Analyze from the right-hand design sidebar, and clicking the Analyze button.</p>\n<p>Results appear in the blink of an eye, each with five primary hues that can be saved and applied throughout a project. Additional hues are available by using the pull-down menu to display only lighter or darker color options, but users can save an unlimited number of color schemes, each with a custom name. I did find one small bug that caused color schemes to vanish when reselecting analyzed photos, but toggling the pull-down menu temporarily restored them.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0039-0148/396497-1-eng-US/f0039-012.jpg\" width=\"619\" height=\"384\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0039-01\" title=\"f0039-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>iScrapbook 7 includes a powerful new color wheel for creating or editing just the right hue for each project you’re working on.</b></p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>THROWING SHADE</b></h3><p>Analyzing photos isn’t the only way to bring a splash of color to iScrapbook 7 projects. There’s a new eyedropper tool that can be used to pick colors from anywhere on your screen—even outside of the application—and apply them to selected content. You can also use the standard Mac color picker, although it’s positively feeble compared to what Chronos offers.</p>\n<p>Divided into warm and cool shades, the color wheel also includes a Blends tab, which can be used to create up to 100 shades, tints, or tones from a pair of dominant colors. Finally, users can choose from a dizzying array of color wheel display modes, including analogous, triadic, and several complementary, compound, and rectangular choices.</p>\n<p>The downside of any major update so focused on a specific feature category is there’s no room for anything else. Outside of the color-tinged overhaul, version 7.0 is identical to its predecessor. Every new feature involves pigment, from color schemes all the way down to the built-in hex field used to copy or paste colors from other applications.</p>\n<p>Normally the lack of new feature diversity would be disappointing, but after a decade in development, Chronos has already introduced every bit of technological wizardry scrapbookers could ever want. If you’re an existing user who doesn’t need more robust color tools, you can stick with iScrapbook 6.0.9 for now, which is fully compatible with the latest macOS Sierra.</p>\n\n<div

target=\"_self\">Apple</a> made several product updates this spring, introducing a slew of new bands for the Apple Watch. We’re really feeling the $49 Nike Sport Band. This perforated band is designed to let maximum air flow reach your wrist, which you might appreciate if you wear your Apple Watch during grueling, sweaty workouts. This band wasn’t sold separately before—you could only get it with the Nike+ edition of the Apple Watch Series 2. Now you can pick one up for any Apple Watch you already own in three official colorways: black/volt (“volt” is a bright neon yellow), platinum/white (platinum is gray), and anthracite/black (all black). <b>—SUSIE OCHS</b></p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/casetify-bow-copy/398094-1-eng-US/casetify-bow-copy.jpg\" width=\"746\" height=\"560\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"Casetify Bow copy\" title=\"Casetify Bow copy\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3>CASETIFY iPHONE 7 CASES AND COVERS</h3><p>You’ve got your gorgeous new red iPhone 7, and you’ve managed to make it this far without dropping it, scratching it, or throwing it against a wall—congrats! But now it’s time to get back to the real world and slap a case on that thing. We love <a href=\"https://www.casetify.com/\" target=\"_self\">Casetify’s</a> collection of customizable clear cases, which typically run $40 a pop. These polycarbonate cases have a glossy transparent back and a matte, soft-touch frame for extra grip. The frame comes in seven different colors (including clear, black, and red), and Casetify has several different backplate designs to pick from— including this cute bow, pictured here. <b>—SARAH JACOBSSON PUREWAL</b></p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0043-0146/396598-1-eng-US/f0043-012.jpg\" width=\"850\" height=\"518\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0043-01\" title=\"f0043-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n <span class=\"credit\">\nIMAGE: PIXIE</span></figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>PIXIE SMART TAGS</b></h3><p>If you constantly misplace important objects—like your keys, wallet, or Apple TV remote—a smart tracking device like the <a href=\"https://getpixie.com/\" target=\"_self\">Pixie</a> ($50 for a set of two) could help. On the surface, Pixie isn’t much different than other smart tracking devices. You need two teardrop-shaped smart tags called Pixie Points—one attached to your iPhone or iPad, another on the object you want to keep tabs on. Points use proprietary signaling to remain in constant communication with each other, triangulating your location for increased accuracy. To find your missing object, Pixie will scour the area for Pixie Points located within a 30 to 50 feet indoor area or up to 150 feet outside. When it’s been found, AR “pixie dust” appears on-screen, at which point the hunt is on. <b>—J.R.
