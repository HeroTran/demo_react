After all, it was just last November that Sal Soghoian, Apple’s product manager of automation technologies, left the company when <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/link/2016/11/sal-soghoian-leaves-apple/?sourcePath=soghoian\" target=\"_self\">his position was eliminated</a>.</p>\n<p>And yet, Apple snapped up <a href=\"http://www.macworld.com/article/2859939/workflow-for-ios-review-an-awesome-mac-like-app-for-our-post-pc-devices.html?sourcePath=wrkflw\" target=\"_self\">Workflow</a>, an app that many had compared to Apple’s own <a href=\"http://www.macworld.com/article/2038095/5-automator-workflows-everyone-should-have.html?sourcePath=autowf\" target=\"_self\">Automator</a>, which was introduced way back in 2005’s Mac OS X Tiger. So what gives? Is there still some life in automation and scripting features on Apple’s platforms, or is this merely a case of Apple acquiring useful talent?</p>\n<h3><b>FOLLOW THE SCRIPT</b></h3><p>Scripting’s been part of the Mac since the earliest days. AppleScript, which grew out of HyperCard’s HyperTalk scripting language, was built into System 7 back in 1993. It was a way to automate complex tasks across multiple applications, and it had a lot of power thanks not only to its deep integration into the OS, but also to third-party developers who made their apps addressable by the scripting language.</p>\n<p>But for all its power, AppleScript has always been a bit esoteric. While it was intended to be accessible and used a sort of natural English syntax, it was often still too complex for the average user. On the other end, those used to more traditional programming languages found its idiosyncrasies equally baffling.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0046-0161/396634-1-eng-US/f0046-012.jpg\" width=\"1250\" height=\"888\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0046-01\" title=\"f0046-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>When AppleScript found its way into OS X—if anecdotal accounts are to be believed, almost entirely thanks to the willpower of Soghoian—it laid the groundwork for Automator, a graphical and more user-friendly attempt to handle the kind of tasks AppleScript had. But Automator never quite managed to live up to its potential. In many cases, one had to fall back on AppleScript or UNIX shell scripts to accomplish some functions, and its graphical interface still wasn’t enough to make it friendly to most mainstream users.</p>\n<p>But as computers became more mature and powerful, there wasn’t always the same need for automation and scripting as there had been back in the early days when many users needed to also be part programmer to get things done. Many tasks that had once been automated could now be handled by applications created by Apple or third parties. Though both AppleScript and Automation stuck around in subsequent releases of OS X, neither got any real attention from Apple.</p>\n<p class=\"pullQuote\">A few years after Automation’s introduction, the iPhone showed up with no automation capabilities whatsoever.</p>\n<h3><b>WORKFLOW ON iOS</b></h3><p>A few years after Automation’s introduction, the iPhone showed up with no automation capabilities whatsoever. Though many parts of OS X made the jump to the platform, AppleScript and Automator were left behind. Almost 10 years later, that situation hasn’t changed. It was just in 2014 that apps even got the ability to <a href=\"http://www.macworld.com/article/2684894/ios-8-extensions-how-they-work-and-why-they-matter-to-you.html?sourcePath=ios8ext\" target=\"_self\">communicate with one another</a>.</p>\n<p>Enter Workflow, an app that is, on the surface, very similar to Automator, providing a graphical interface with which to automate complex tasks across apps and services. But the kicker is that it pulled all this functionality off without Apple’s help.</p>\n<p>While some have embraced Workflow’s power, it’s suffered from the same chal- lenges that Automator has encountered on the Mac. Most users either don’t have or haven’t identified a need for automation, and for the fraction that have, only another fraction go through the trouble of finding and learning to use a tool like Workflow.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0048-0163/396627-1-eng-US/f0048-012.jpg\" width=\"366\" height=\"650\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0048-01\" title=\"f0048-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>WILL THE FUTURE BE AUTOMATED?</b></h3><p>All of which makes Apple’s acquisition of Workflow even more puzzling. The easy answer, of course, is that Apple was impressed with the resourcefulness of the development team and wanted to hire them. In the long term, that will probably mean shutting down Workflow.</p>\n<p>I’m not convinced, though, in part because Workflow provides useful features that aren’t available anywhere else. (And Apple’s first move was to make the app free, which could be a sign they plan to keep it around.) That could be a compelling enough argument for Apple to make use of the app’s capabilities itself. Why reinvent the wheel if the company is interested in bringing automation to iOS?</p>\n<p>And, frankly, it should be. Even with the addition of app extensions in iOS 8, interapp communication has remained a weak point. Why not bring Workflow to the Mac? Well maybe because at its more mature age, it isn’t crying out for automation in the same way. AppleScript and Automator are still there, after all, and while they might not get more useful as time goes by, neither has their functionality been snatched away.</p>\n<p>But let’s face it: iOS and the iPhone are the most prominent part of Apple’s identity these days, and what happens there sets the tone for the company. It’s a no-brainer that the company wants its products to get more powerful and useful, and Workflow’s capabilities might be one way to do that.</p>\n","layout":{},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":0,"link_source":"","competition":[],"flatplan_title":"","notes":"","gutter_credit":"","other":"","image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1492428245.4019","name":"f0045-01","source":"IMAGE: ADAM PATRICK MURRAY","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0045-0148/396641-1-eng-US/f0045-012.jpg?t=default_ipad_portrait&ext/f0045-012_default_ipad_portrait.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"768","height":"550","legacy_id":"26510","is_default":true},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1492428245.4019","name":"f0045-01","source":"IMAGE: ADAM PATRICK MURRAY","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0045-0148/396641-1-eng-US/f0045-012.jpg?t=default_ipad_landscape&ext/f0045-012_default_ipad_landscape.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"1024","height":"734","legacy_id":"26510","is_default":false}],"related_objects":{"image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_2_1492428244.1664","name":"f0048-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0048-0163/396627-1-eng-US/f0048-012.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"366","height":"650","legacy_id":"26508"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_2_1492428244.1664","name":"f0048-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0048-0163/396627-1-eng-US/f0048-012.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"366","height":"650","legacy_id":"26508"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_1_1492428244.8427","name":"f0046-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0046-0161/396634-1-eng-US/f0046-012.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"1250","height":"888","legacy_id":"26509"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_1_1492428244.8427","name":"f0046-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0046-0161/396634-1-eng-US/f0046-012.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"1250","height":"888","legacy_id":"26509"}]},"url_alias":"http://macworld-us.audiencemedia.com","type":"story","order":"8","folio_number":"45","folio_numbers":"45","pdf_page_index":"45","thumbnail":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0045-0148/396641-1-eng-US/f0045-012.jpg?t=tablet_story_thumbnail&ext/f0045-012_tablet_story_thumbnail.jpg","color":"2699cd","real_id":"28771","main_section_id":"1422","ads":[]},{"id":"7d520b5fb447588afb72ea9d0401e5d6","title":"New Apple Watch buyers face limited band selection","sub_title":"","author":[{"id":"0","name":"CAITLIN McCARRY","email":"noreply@audiencemedia.com","is_default":false}],"tag":"","strap_line":"APPLE WATCH BAND SELECTION","intro":"You may have to buy your preferred Apple Watch band as a separate accessory.","body":"<p class=\"byline\"><b>BY CAITLIN McGARRY</b></p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0049-0150/396677-1-eng-US/f0049-012.jpg\" width=\"974\" height=\"621\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0049-01\" title=\"f0049-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n <span class=\"credit\">\nIMAGE: APPLE</span></figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p><b>W</b>hen I decided to buy an Apple Watch Series 2, I knew exactly which model I wanted: rose gold with the pink and midnight woven nylon band.

In fact, you can’t choose a nylon band alongside your aluminum or stainless steel watch at all anymore. Your choices are a Sport band, a Milanese loop, or an ultra-expensive Hermes leather band.</p>\n<p>The changing inventory, first noticed by AppleInsider, could be due to limited demand for specific combinations of case and band. But one of the great things about the Apple Watch is its personalization, and being able to choose the exact finish and band type right out of the box went a long way toward making that buying decision even more personal.</p>\n<p>Now you’re limited to four Sport band colors— pink, blue, white, and black—with your new 38mm or 42mm Series 2 watch, and just one Milanese loop, the silver option. Sure, you can customize your stainless steel Apple Watch with an Hermes leather band, but that’ll drive the price way up—the cheapest Hermes-and-watch combo is $1,149. Why not allow people to choose a cheaper Apple-made leather option out of the box instead?</p>\n<p>Accessories have huge revenue-driving potential, and Apple just released new watch bands in a variety of colors and styles that will tempt many watch owners to stock up (myself included). That wide range of options likely makes inventory management tougher, so it makes sense that Apple would simplify the combinations it stocks as it adds more bands as standalone accessories. But it’s a bummer that new Apple Watch buyers won’t be able to get that truly customized experience.

target=\"_self\">Overcast 2.5 review</a>  for the fundamentals. The app’s improvements and significant changes are called out in this review. Fortunately, nothing has gotten worse.</p>\n<p>Here’s what Overcast 3 does better or differently than version 2.5.</p>\n<p><b>Queuing.</b> One of the biggest gaps between Overcast and its non-Apple competitors was the lack of an on-the-fly way to add podcasts to a queue. Version 3 creates a special kind of static playlist, the Main Queue, to which episodes can be added in any view in which you can see individual episodes. This isn’t as flexible or robust as Castro’s approach, but it fits in neatly with Overcast’s focus on playlist-based subscription and episode management.</p>\n<p><b>Wonky pop-ups, pop-overs, and sliders.</b> Version 3 eliminates a number of different interface modalities for letting you interact with elements of the app by using a card view in most cases. This makes it easier to manipulate controls or simply find them in the first place, and scrapes away most of the app’s minimal routine frustrations that remained. For example, the Now Playing view is a card that shows the playback by default as the center of three cards: swipe right to get playback controls and swipe left to see show notes, which contain clickable links.</p>\n\n<div>\n<table bgcolor=\"#eeeeee\">\n<tr>\n    <td>\n    <h3><b>OVERCAST 3</b></h3>\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/5mice3/398087-1-eng-US/5mice.png\" width=\"362\" height=\"144\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"5mice\" title=\"5mice\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h4><b>PROS</b></h4><p>• Clean design across all iOS devices</p>\n<p>• Queue feature adds simple episode triage</p>\n<p>• Smart playlists allow robust organization</p>\n<p>• Can trim silences from spoken word podcasts</p>\n<h4><b>CONS</b></h4><p>• Queue feature requires too many steps for streamlined triage</p>\n\n    </td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n</div><p><b>Tiny i button fixed.</b> This was a tweaky complaint of mine, but I wasn’t alone. A tiny <i>i</i> info-button target was used for episode interaction in all playlist views. It was easy to miss the target, which would then start an episode playback with no way to easily resume the podcast you had been listening to. That’s gone. The playlist view now has a “hamburger” re-order button so you can drag episodes. Tapping the episode reveals controls, such as Sharing, Favorite, Play, and Add To Queue. A larger <i>i</i> target on that view then properly brings up show notes. If you didn’t use Overcast prior to version 3, it’s difficult to express how much this improves the interface.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0057-0144/396813-1-eng-US/f0057-012.jpg\" width=\"401\" height=\"676\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0057-01\" title=\"f0057-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>Recommendations for podcast to which to listen in Overcast 3 remains strong, but adding multiples is now possible.</b></p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p><b>Adding multiple podcast subscriptions.</b> Another minor but ongoing irritation was the podcast directory. You could spend a while searching and find multiple podcasts to which you wanted to subscribe, and then after adding one the directory dismissed itself, and you had to perform the same searches and navigation to get back to the same place. That’s been fixed. Adding a podcast leaves the view available and in the same location.</p>\n<p><b>A change in patronage support.</b> Developer Marco Arment has worked through multiple approaches for ongoing revenue from the app, and is now in his fourth iteration. He started with a freemium design, in which the basic app was limited, and an in-app purchase unlocked the full app. This shifted to voluntary patronage, which included a few extra features. That didn’t pan out quite as well, so he moved to free with ads from an ad network coupled with Overcast Premium, a $9.99-a-year patronage level that removed ads and added non-podcast feed file uploads.</p>\n<p>In version 3, he’s shifted to selling his own ads and removing third-party ad network code and analytics, so he’s in full control of information about user-targeting data that leaves the app. (Which, according to the privacy page, is none.)</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0058-0168/396806-1-eng-US/f0058-012.jpg\" width=\"366\" height=\"239\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0058-01\" title=\"f0058-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>The info button no longer leads to unwanted playback.</b></p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>BOTTOM LINE</b></h3><p>Overcast 3 is the final icing on a cake that’s been perfected over three years. All of the tiny flaws coupled with the inability to create a simple queue have been reworked. Improvements at this point are only about massaging the app rather than achieving a new apotheosis.</p>\n<p>The only issue with Overcast that might prevent someone from adopting it as their app of choice is whether its playlist approach matches the way in which they consume podcasts. If you routinely listen to most podcasts to which you subscribe and episodes you add manually, or create custom lists to shift among as you commute, travel, or workout, Overcast is the best app for your needs.</p>\n","layout":{},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":0,"link_source":"","competition":[],"flatplan_title":"","notes":"","gutter_credit":"","other":"","image":[{"id":"06375c76042885a6c2d0ac3d11b24979","name":"overcast","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/overcast/398157-1-eng-US/overcast.jpg?t=default_ipad_portrait&ext/overcast_default_ipad_portrait.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"768","height":"539","legacy_id":"26657","is_default":true},{"id":"06375c76042885a6c2d0ac3d11b24979","name":"overcast","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/overcast/398157-1-eng-US/overcast.jpg?t=default_ipad_landscape&ext/overcast_default_ipad_landscape.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"1024","height":"719","legacy_id":"26657","is_default":false}],"related_objects":{"image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_3_1492428254.26","name":"f0058-02","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0058-0224/396799-1-eng-US/f0058-022.jpg?t=default_ipad_portrait&ext/f0058-022_default_ipad_portrait.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"768","height":"287","legacy_id":"26528"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_3_1492428254.26","name":"f0058-02","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0058-0224/396799-1-eng-US/f0058-022.jpg?t=default_ipad_landscape&ext/f0058-022_default_ipad_landscape.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"1024","height":"382","legacy_id":"26528"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_2_1492428254.8248","name":"f0058-01","source":"","caption":"<p><b>The
