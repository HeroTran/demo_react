The new 2017 iPad is more or less a mashup of parts we’ve seen before: the same A9 chip that powers the iPhone 6s, the same size and weight as the first iPad Air (minus the physical lock switch, sadly), and the same camera as the iPad Air 2. This is more of a throwback than a brand-new product, kind of the iPad equivalent of the iPhone SE.</p>\n<p>And you know what? That’s fine with me. Now that the iPad has been around a while, and we’ve seen what the use cases are and how long they tend to last, a low-cost, full-size iPad is just what the lineup needed.</p>\n<h3><b>DEJA VIEW</b></h3><p>An iPad is basically a screen you hold in your hands, so the screen quality is important, and Apple didn’t skimp on this one. First of all, it’s plenty bright. Apple says it tops out at 500 nits, thanks to a stronger backlight, which is the same brightness as the 9.7-inch iPad Pro, and 25 percent brighter than the iPad Air 2. It can still be tricky to see in the very brightest sunlight, but overall you can notice the improvement.</p>\n<p>The 9.7-inch iPad Pro has the <a href=\"https://www.dpreview.com/forums/thread/4052120?sourcePath=ipadpro97p3\" target=\"_self\">P3 color gamut as well as SRGB</a>, and iOS manages the colors so you always see the most accurate image. The same iPad Pro also has <a href=\"http://www.anandtech.com/show/10286/the-97-ipad-pro-review/6?sourcePath=truetoneana\" target=\"_self\">True Tone</a>, which further adjusts the display to match the color temperature of the room’s lighting. This new iPad has neither of those: no True Tone (although it does have <a href=\"http://www.macworld.com/article/3047121/iphone-ipad/ios-93-the-new-night-shift-feature-probably-wont-help-you-sleep-better.html?sourcePath=nightshiftsleep\" target=\"_self\">Night Shift</a>, and just SRGB color. But since those features are available on the higher-end tablet, it makes sense to cut them from the lower-cost model— they’re nice-to-haves, not need-to-haves, and I haven’t missed them when using the new iPad in a variety of lighting situations.</p>\n<p>The new iPad also lacks <a href=\"http://www.macworld.com/article/3159549/hardware/apple-pencil-2-might-be-coming-this-spring-along-with-a-new-105-inch-ipad-pro.html?sourcePath=pencil2news\" target=\"_self\">Apple Pencil</a> support, the iPad Pro’s fourspeaker setup, as well as the Smart Connector. Again, I don’t miss them much. The iPad gets loud enough to watch movies and TV and enjoy music without relying on headphones or a Bluetooth speaker, even if the sound doesn’t have all the gravitas of the iPad Pro’s. Yes, it has a headphone jack, and let’s pray that iPads always will.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0069-0147/396977-1-eng-US/f0069-012.jpg\" width=\"648\" height=\"489\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0069-01\" title=\"f0069-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>UNDER THE HOOD</b></h3><p>The main reason the new iPad is nearly as good as the iPad Pro is how well it runs the thousands of iPad apps. The A9 chip is the third generation of the 64-bit A-series chips, and it also brings a better image signal processor and more accurate M9 motion coprocessor than the iPad Air 2’s A8X. Apple says the new chip is more battery efficient, plus the new iPad has a slightly larger battery than its predecessor. (The battery is 32.9 watt-hours, the same as the first iPad Air. The slimmer iPad Air 2 shaved the battery down to 27.6, and interestingly, the 9.7-inch iPad Pro’s battery is 27.9.) I had no trouble beating Apple’s 10-hour estimate consistently, with one video-streaming test stretching to 12 hours, 44 minutes.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"pullQuote\">The 8-megapixel rear-facing iSight camera, and the front-facing 1.2-megapixel camera aren’t changed from the iPad Air 2, but the coprocessor that controls them—the image signal processor—is.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0070-0171/396970-1-eng-US/f0070-012.jpg\" width=\"286\" height=\"306\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0070-01\" title=\"f0070-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>The iPad starts up quickly, unlocks in a flash with the speedy Touch ID button, and runs heavy apps like Pixelmator, Lightroom, and GarageBand with no sweat. It scored 2251 in Geekbench 4.1’s single- core CPU test, and 4417 in the multicore CPU test, putting it right between the iPad Air 2 and the iPad Pro in terms of performance—right where you’d expect.</p>\n<p>The 8-megapixel rear-facing iSight camera, and the front-facing 1.2-megapixel camera aren’t changed from the iPad Air 2, but the coprocessor that controls them—the image signal processor—is. Like the iPhone 7, the iPad’s ISP assembles multiple frames each time you take a photo, which should reduce noise and give you a sharper, clearer result. I don’t take a lot of pictures with my iPad—I’m more likely to have my iPhone handy when a photo opportunity strikes—but a good camera is still important for video chatting, augmented reality, and creative fun like stop-motion animation or Apple’s new Clips app. Oh, and the camera sits flush with the back of the iPad, unlike the 9.7-inch iPad Pro, which has a slight camera bulge.</p>\n<h3><b>IPAD, IPAD PRO, OR IPAD MINI?</b></h3><p>Which iPad should you buy? The iPad mini is still around, but down to one SKU, 128GB of storage for $399. So if that’s the size you like, this feels like a “now or never” moment. It’s got an A8 chip, which is 64-bit, so it should support iOS updates for a while, although it seems a given that Apple would stop supporting the iPad mini before the A9-equipped 2017 iPad. In fact, Apple didn’t even give this iPad mini a new generation number: It’s the same fourth-generation iPad mini first introduced in the fall of 2015. You just get more storage for your $399: now 128GB, up from the 16GB it launched with in 2015 or the 32GB it was bumped up to in 2016.</p>\n<p>So if you need tons of storage, you’ll save a little bit opting for the 128GB iPad mini 4 for $399, instead of the 128GB iPad for $429. But since that $30 difference gets you a bigger iPad with a newer processor, I don’t think the iPad mini 4 will be overwhelmingly popular. It feels like a clearance product.</p>\n<p>If you’re trying to choose between this $329 9.7-inch iPad and the $599 9.7-inch iPad Pro, there are a couple factors to consider. If you know you want the Apple Pencil or Apple’s Smart Keyboard, you’ll need the Pro of course. But there are capable third-party alternatives for both of those accessories that would work with the regular iPad, like Adobe’s lovely Ink stylus and Logitech’s Bluetooth keyboard cases.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0071-0150/396963-1-eng-US/f0071-012.jpg\" width=\"913\" height=\"560\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0071-01\" title=\"f0071-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>For me, the value of a $329 iPad outweighs the novelty of the Apple Pencil or Smart Keyboard. Add cellular for $130 more, and you’re still spending less than you would on the Wi-Fi-only iPad Pro. However, if you intend to do real work on your tablet day in and day out—treating it like a laptop—you might want to future-proof your investment a little by selecting an iPad Pro with the more advanced A10X chip, or even waiting a bit to see if and how Apple refreshes the iPad Pro lineup this year.</p>\n<h3><b>BOTTOM LINE</b></h3><p>This iPad is great for families, schools, businesses looking for a point-of-sale system, and just anyone who wants a workhorse of an iPad without the bells and whistles of the more expensive iPad Pro. It’s everything great about the iPad at a lower cost to entry than ever, and if your kids are as nuts about the iPad as mine is, this is the one to get them.</p>\n","layout":{},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":0,"link_source":"","competition":[],"flatplan_title":"","notes":"","gutter_credit":"","other":"","image":[{"id":"4739a69520c53d5e21285b4cdc1e1f50","name":"iPad-feature-2","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/ipad-feature-2/399054-1-eng-US/ipad-feature-2.jpg?t=default_ipad_portrait&ext/ipad-feature-2_default_ipad_portrait.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"768","height":"576","legacy_id":"26669","is_default":true},{"id":"4739a69520c53d5e21285b4cdc1e1f50","name":"iPad-feature-2","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/ipad-feature-2/399054-1-eng-US/ipad-feature-2.jpg?t=default_ipad_landscape&ext/ipad-feature-2_default_ipad_landscape.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"1024","height":"768","legacy_id":"26669","is_default":false}],"related_objects":{"image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_4_1492428264.3764","name":"f0071-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0071-0150/396963-1-eng-US/f0071-012.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"913","height":"560","legacy_id":"26548"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_4_1492428264.3764","name":"f0071-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0071-0150/396963-1-eng-US/f0071-012.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"913","height":"560","legacy_id":"26548"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_3_1492428264.9991","name":"f0070-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0070-0171/396970-1-eng-US/f0070-012.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"286","height":"306","legacy_id":"26549"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_3_1492428264.9991","name":"f0070-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0070-0171/396970-1-eng-US/f0070-012.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"286","height":"306","legacy_id":"26549"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_2_1492428265.5288","name":"f0069-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0069-0147/396977-1-eng-US/f0069-012.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"648","height":"489","legacy_id":"26550"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_2_1492428265.5288","name":"f0069-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0069-0147/396977-1-eng-US/f0069-012.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"648","height":"489","legacy_id":"26550"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_1_1492428266.075","name":"f0068-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0068-0168/396984-1-eng-US/f0068-012.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"914","height":"503","legacy_id":"26551"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_1_1492428266.075","name":"f0068-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0068-0168/396984-1-eng-US/f0068-012.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"914","height":"503","legacy_id":"26551"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1492428266.6081","name":"f0067-01","source":"IMAGES:

In my <a href=\"http://www.macworld.com/article/3151535/iphone-ipad/airpods-review-they-sound-great-but-siri-holds-them-back.html?sourcePath=arpdrev\" target=\"_self\">testing</a>, I’ve found the AirPods surprisingly stable—they stay perched in my ears no matter what, even when <a href=\"http://www.macworld.com/video/72535/apple-airpods-review-nope-they-dont-fall-out?sourcePath=arpdjump\" target=\"_self\">I’m running, jumping, and headbanging</a>. But the BeatsX earbuds are more comfortable, since they come with four sets of silicone tips, and two sizes of optional wings you can slip on over the tips if you want extra help keeping the earbuds in place.</p>\n<p>Even the quality of the silicone tips seems top-notch—the tips grip the insides of my ear canals firmly and don’t slide out. They don’t even get sticky or greasy like other earbuds can after they’ve been exposed to your earwax for a while.</p>\n<p>The wire that connects the two earbuds wraps around the back of your neck, and plastic pieces on either side act as anchors to keep the whole thing stable. One of the plastic pieces has the on/off button, and the other has a Lightning port you’ll use to charge the BeatsX. (You can’t listen to them while charging.) Then the inline remote is a little further up the cable on the left side, which puts it right below your chin in a pretty easy spot to reach up and grab.</p>\n\n<div>\n<table bgcolor=\"#eeeeee\">\n<tr>\n    <td>\n    <h3><b>BeatsX</b></h3>\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/5mice4/398164-1-eng-US/5mice.png\" width=\"362\" height=\"144\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"5mice\" title=\"5mice\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h4><b>AT A GLANCE</b></h4><p>BeatsX boast the best features of AirPods, plus a more comfortable, customizable fit, and a handy inline remote so you don’t need to rely on Siri for control.</p>\n<h4><b>PROS</b></h4><p>• Inline remote plus Siri control gives you options.</p>\n<p>• Deep integration with iOS, including battery level readout in Today view.</p>\n<p>• Comfortable fit and good sound.</p>\n<h4><b>CONS</b></h4><p>• Cable that connects the earbuds is a little awkward.</p>\n<h4><b>PRICE</b></h4><p>$150</p>\n\n    </td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n</div><p>It took me a while to get used to the remote being on the left side, which is common with Beats headphones, even though it’s on the right side on other Apple headphones. The buttons on the remote are easy to click, and it supports the standard button-presses: One click on the center button to play or pause, two clicks to advance, and three clicks to go back.</p>\n<p>I love having a remote on these so much that I don’t even mind how they look. Totally wireless earbuds like the AirPods are still new—they stand out, even while the lack of wire hanging down lets them blend in. If my hair is down or I’m wearing a hat, you might not even notice the AirPods, but if you do see them, they kind of look like futuristic earrings, and of course they only come in white. People still stop me to ask me how I like them.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0075-0151/397055-1-eng-US/f0075-012.jpg\" width=\"591\" height=\"367\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0075-01\" title=\"f0075-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>Headphone selfie!

There’s no wire to your iPhone of course, but you wind up with a big wire loop on either side of your head, where the headphone cable hangs down from your ears before then snaking around behind your neck. While the overall look is less attention- grabbing than the newness of the AirPods, it’s also a little clunky and cheaper- looking. Then again, I got the stark white BeatsX—the other colors (black, gray, and blue) might blend in with clothing and hair a little more and not stand out so much.</p>\n<p>When I asked coworkers which look “cooler,” opinions were split. I think the AirPods look a little cooler, personally, but I still like the BeatsX better.</p>\n<h3><b>EASY PAIRING AND AWESOME BATTERY LIFE</b></h3><p>Thanks to the same W1 chip that’s in the AirPods, the BeatsX is easy to pair to your iPhone. When you press the power button on the BeatsX, the earbuds go into pairing mode, and you can connect them to any Bluetooth device in the usual way.</p>\n<p>If you’re trying to connect to an iPhone or iPad running iOS 10, a pop-up will offer to pair them automatically, and then they’ll show up as an available device in other iOS 10 and macOS Sierra devices you’re signed in to with the same iCloud account. On my Mac, I had to go to the Bluetooth menu and select Connect next to the BeatsX option to switch, rather than the BeatsX showing up in the audio menu automatically. On other iPads and iPhones, they just appear as a potential audio source right away.</p>\n<p>All in all, pairing and switching is just as easy with the BeatsX as with the AirPods, and like the AirPods, the BeatsX’s battery life will appear in the Batteries widget in iOS’s Today view. The battery life is also viewable on the Mac, if you Option-click the Bluetooth icon in your menu bar and then mouse over the connected BeatsX.</p>\n<p>And speaking of battery life, the BeatsX delivers. Apple estimates 8 hours per charge, but mine can routinely squeeze out closer to 9. The AirPods last 5. And in my tests, a quick 15-minute top-up boosted my BeatsX from totally dead to 73 percent charged—let’s hear it for the W1 chip’s killer quick-charging feature.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/beats-iphone/399047-1-eng-US/beats-iphone.jpg\" width=\"513\" height=\"451\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"beats-iphone\" title=\"beats-iphone\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>Pairing to an iOS 10 device is simple—just press the button on the BeatsX and you’ll see the pop-up shown at left. iOS knows the BeatsX battery life too (and you’ll get none of the weirdness displayed here by my AirPods, where one is more charged than the other).</b></p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>The BeatsX charge with a Lightning cable, and one is included. This isn’t quite as cool as the AirPods’ charging case, but it’s certainly more convenient. Most iPhone users own multiple Lightning cables, and you could use a portable USB battery to top up on the go. The package of battery, cable, and the BeatsX (even in their little rubber carrying case) is bulkier than the AirPods inside their case, that’s true. But I once left my AirPods case at the office and then walked out wearing them, which resulted in unusable, dead AirPods for a whole weekend, something that just wouldn’t happen with these.</p>\n<h3><b>GREAT SOUND</b></h3><p>The sound of the BeatsX is full and clear, similar to the AirPods’ sound. I like the sealed-off feeling from silicone earbuds that fit snugly into my ear canals, and I think it gives a more complete bubble of sound that doesn’t need to be quite as loud to be effective at shutting out the world.</p>\n<p>The AirPods stay put in my ears, but they aren’t designed to seal off your ear canals, so more outside sound bleeds through and the music feels a little airier, in my opinion. But both sound good to my ears, and worth their premium price. I’ve heard people complain that Beats headphones tend to be too bass-heavy, but I like a bass-heavy sound, so I either didn’t notice or didn’t mind.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0078-0168/397027-1-eng-US/f0078-012.jpg\" width=\"556\" height=\"556\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0078-01\" title=\"f0078-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>They come in white, black, gray, or blue.</b></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n <span class=\"credit\">\nImage: Beats by Dre</span></figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>BOTTOM LINE</b></h3><p>If you aren’t using these with exclusively Apple devices, definitely get the BeatsX because of the inline remote. The button-less AirPods are too reliant on Siri or the controls on your phone. If you are all-in with Apple gear, either is a fine option, but the BeatsX has the comfort, long battery life, and convenient charging that give it the edge.</p>\n","layout":{},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":0,"link_source":"","competition":[],"flatplan_title":"","notes":"","gutter_credit":"","other":"","image":[{"id":"58c6ef87163f06b1980478dfd03e1396","name":"beats","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/beats/399095-1-eng-US/beats.jpg?t=default_ipad_portrait&ext/beats_default_ipad_portrait.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"482","height":"1024","legacy_id":"26671","is_default":true},{"id":"58c6ef87163f06b1980478dfd03e1396","name":"beats","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/beats/399095-1-eng-US/beats.jpg?t=default_ipad_landscape&ext/beats_default_ipad_landscape.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"361","height":"768","legacy_id":"26671","is_default":false}],"related_objects":{"image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_8_1492428267.7601","name":"f0075-02","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0075-0222/397020-1-eng-US/f0075-022.jpg?t=default_ipad_portrait&ext/f0075-022_default_ipad_portrait.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"768","height":"287","legacy_id":"26555"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_8_1492428267.7601","name":"f0075-02","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0075-0222/397020-1-eng-US/f0075-022.jpg?t=default_ipad_landscape&ext/f0075-022_default_ipad_landscape.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"1024","height":"382","legacy_id":"26555"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_7_1492428268.2921","name":"f0078-01","source":"Image:
