Here at <i>Macworld,</i> we like to throw open the windows, beat the dust out of the rugs, and straighten up our Mac desktops. Don’t stop at cleaning your home this season. Clean up your Mac.</p>\n<p>If you’re using macOS Sierra, it has a feature that will help tremendously with your Spring cleaning: Optimize Storage. You can use Optimize Storage to activate the Store In iCloud option, remove iTunes videos you’ve watched (they can be re-downloaded), set it to empty the Trash automatically, reduce clutter caused by large files and downloads, and a lot more. Optimize Storage is especially handy if you’re using a Mac laptop with flash storage. You usually don’t get the same amount of space as you would with a hard drive, so managing your space becomes more important.</p>\n<p>Besides Optimize Storage, there are other ways to keep your Mac digitally clean. These tips from our editors will help you keep your Mac fresh and organized, whether you’re using macOS Sierra or an older version of OS X.</p>\n<h3><b>TIDY UP YOUR DESKTOP</b></h3><p>Light Pillar’s wonderful app <a href=\"http://www.macworld.com/article/1168312/desktop_tidy_lets_you_hide_and_manage_desktop_files.html?sourcePath=desktoptidy\" target=\"_self\">Desktop Tidy</a> ($8; available on the App Store; requires OS X 10.8 or later) is a handy utility that cleans up your Mac’s desktop, keeping it free of clutter. It stores all desktop files and folders in a hidden Shadow Desktop, which you can access from the menu bar or in the Finder. That way, every file I download, each screenshot I capture, and every image I drag and drop to my desktop is stored and filed in an easy-to reach location.</p>\n<p>The utility quietly works its magic at scheduled intervals—as often as every minute or as infrequently as every seven days. It even organizes desktop items by file type, which makes finding and renaming files easy.<i>—Leah Yamshon</i></p>\n<h3><b>DELETE UNNECESSARY DISK IMAGES</b></h3><p>For most people, the Downloads folder is a dumping ground where files pile up in forgotten heaps. Go to the Downloads folder in the Finder and type <b>disk image</b> into the search box. Select Disk Image under the Kinds header. Now, delete all of those downloaded DMG files that are just taking up space!—Jason Snell</p>\n<p>In macOS Sierra, there’s another way to delete disk images. Go to the Apple menu and select About This Mac, then select Storage and click on the Manage button. In the Reduce Clutter section, click on the Review Files button. In the main window, click on Downloads and the click on the Kind header to sort by that particular type. To delete a disk image, click on it, and then click on the X button that appears.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0082-0167/397140-1-eng-US/f0082-012.jpg\" width=\"584\" height=\"221\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0082-01\" title=\"f0082-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>Find all those leftover disk images in your Downloads folder and clean them out.</b></p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>EMPTY OUT SPACE-HOGGING MAIL DOWNLOADS</b></h3><p>I get quite a few attachments via email—PDFs, ePub ebooks, Word documents, images, you name it. Most of the time I save those files to my desktop or my Downloads folder, but on occasion I make the mistake of double-clicking a file. When you do that, the document saves itself to your Mail Downloads folder, hidden away in your Library file. Double- click enough files, and that folder can balloon in size. That’s why I make sure to check it and empty it every year or so.</p>\n<p>The easiest way I find to do this is to use Spotlight—press Command-Space to see a search field appear—and then type <b>Mail Downloads</b>. In the Folders section, you should see the Mail Downloads Data folder.</p>\n<p>If this isn’t working for you, try getting to it the long way. In the Finder, select Go → Go To Folder. Type <b>~/Library/Containers/com.apple.mail/Data/Library/Mail Downloads</b> in the text field. Click Go, and a Finder window will open showing the Mail Downloads folder.</p>\n<p>Once you get to the folder, you can select all files and delete, or rescue the few files you want to keep awhile in a more permanent location—say, the regular old Downloads folder.<i>—Serenity Caldwell</i></p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0083-0151/397133-1-eng-US/f0083-012.jpg\" width=\"495\" height=\"313\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0083-01\" title=\"f0083-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>With a few stray clicks, the Mail Downloads folder can balloon in size, holding megabytes’ worth of files you didn’t even know were there.</b></p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>KEEP A CLEAN CACHE</b></h3><p>We’ve all heard “Empty your cache” as a web browser troubleshooting tip. As it turns out, a Mac stores a lot of information—not just browser-related details—in files called caches, allowing quick access to that data and reducing the need to fetch it from the original source again. Unfortunately, that information can sometimes become corrupted, or otherwise problematic. For example, you might end up looking at old data instead of the most current version of a website, or you may notice that a file’s icon doesn’t look quite right in the Finder.</p>\n<p>Although you can manually go in and find some of OS X’s most commonly used cache directories (<b>~/Library/Caches</b> is a good place to start), plenty of tools will handle this job for you. <a href=\"http://www.maintain.se/cocktail/\" target=\"_self\">Cocktail</a>, from Maintain, is among the longest-running and best of these. Not only can it clear your caches, but it can also perform assorted other maintenance tasks, such as deleting your browser’s cookies, looking for corrupted preference files, rebuilding certain databases, and way more. You can download it and use it for free for up to ten launches, but at $19, it’s a pretty good buy.<i>—Dan Moren</i></p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0084-0166/397126-1-eng-US/f0084-012.jpg\" width=\"450\" height=\"299\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0084-01\" title=\"f0084-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>Maintain’s Cocktail utility can clear out your caches and perform a bunch of other maintenance tasks.</b></p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>PURGE UNWANTED APPS</b></h3><p>As someone who reviews products for <i>Macworld,</i> I regularly try new apps and then delete them. For the most part, you can drag an app from the Applications folder to the Trash, but often an app creates folders and files outside of the app package and in various locations on the drive, which makes those files and folders difficult to find and toss out. For this reason, I use <a href=\"http://onnati.net/apptrap/\" target=\"_self\">AppTrap</a>, a free utility that installs as a System Preference pane and runs in the background.</p>\n<p>When you Trash an app, AppTrap finds all the associated files and folders and moves them to the Trash—there’s no need for you to find those files on your hard drive yourself. Sometimes, however, when your Mac is updating an app, you want to keep the associated files but discard the old app; AppTrap will ask if you want to leave the files (which you want to do) or move them to the Trash. You can find other, just-as-capable utilities that do the same thing, but I’ve used AppTrap for years, and it has never given me problems or affected my Mac’s performance.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0084-0224/397119-1-eng-US/f0084-022.jpg\" width=\"438\" height=\"161\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0084-02\" title=\"f0084-02\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>Kumaran Vijayan’s AppTrap rounds up all the files associated with an app, so you can delete everything.</b></p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>In macOS Sierra, you can also remove apps through the Optimize Storage feature. In the Apple menu, select About This Mac. Select Storage and click on the Manage button. In the left section, select Applications. The main section of the window will show a list of your applications. Select the app you want to remove, and then click on the X button to remove it. One caveat with this method: Only apps downloaded from the App Store will have all its components removed. If you got an app outside of the App Store and use this method to uninstall it, all the components may not be removed. Under the Kind header, you can see if an app was from the App Store or not.<i>—Roman Loyola</i></p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0085-0160/397112-1-eng-US/f0085-012.jpg\" width=\"535\" height=\"458\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0085-01\" title=\"f0085-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>In macOS Sierra, the Optimize Storage feature can be used to delete apps from the App Store that you new longer use</b></p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>DISINFECT YOUR GRUBBY KEYBOARD</b></h3><p>My ergonomic keyboard accumulates so much dust and crumbs that occasionally I have to turn it upside down and shake it just to get the keys to work. But a thorough cleaning, even just once a year, can knock away the grime and germs. Unplug your keyboard or, if it is wireless, remove its batteries. If you’re cleaning a laptop, shut it down and unplug it. Blow the dust out from between the keys with a can of compressed air.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0085-0231/397105-1-eng-US/f0085-022.jpg\" width=\"122\" height=\"173\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0085-02\" title=\"f0085-02\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>To finish the job, all you need is a package of disinfecting wipes. <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201294\" target=\"_self\">Apple recommends</a> Lysol Wipes or Clorox Kitchen Disinfecting wipes by brand name. The basic idea, however, is to wipe your keys gently with something alcohol- based. (Before you use a wipe, squeeze out any excess liquid.) As tempting as it might be when you’re feeling germophobic, do not use wipes with bleach, or spray everything with Lysol; you might damage the keyboard.—<i>Scholle Sawyer

If you didn’t know, we just told you. Actually, the name is bit of a giveaway: NAS is storage that you attach via ethernet or Wi-Fi and access across the network. What that <i>doesn’t</i> tell you is that most NAS boxes have the smarts of a PC, with a full-blown app environment that includes extensive backup abilities.</p>\n<p>But there are two things that even NAS aware users might not realize: First, many NAS boxes are perfectly capable of backing up data from PCs running any type of operating system (e.g., Windows, OS X, or Linux) from anywhere, using nothing more than their integrated utilities. All you need to do is configure the PC to give up its data, and then use the NAS box to grab it.</p>\n<p>Second, most NAS boxes can also sync with OneDrive, Google Drive, DropBox and other cloud services to keep your <i>mobile</i> data backed up, too. Sadly, Apple’s iCloud is one of the few services that is not widely supported. But there are ways, and I’ll cover NAS/online syncing at the end for this article.</p>\n<p>There are of course any number of ways to back up to a NAS box that can be invoked locally; i.e., from the PC or device you want to back up. But nearly all involve installing software or client apps or using native backup solutions. Some NAS vendors even provide their own proprietary client/server solutions. Indeed, if you want to back up whole partitions or drives to images, you can only do it from your PC.</p>\n<p class=\"pullQuote\">Most NAS boxes can also sync with OneDrive, Google Drive, DropBox and other cloud services to keep your mobile data backed up, too.</p>\n<h3><b>BACKUP TO NAS USING NAS SOFTWARE</b></h3><p>But if you’re like me, the last thing you want is yet another program bugging you with reminders, warnings, and other messages, not to mention chewing up CPU cycles that you might want for more useful purposes. Why not just use the integrated file-sharing capabilities of computers and leverage the software on the NAS box, instead?</p>\n<p>I’ll show you how to use the backup and sync apps on a NAS box in a bit, but first you need to select a sharing/transfer protocol and configure your computers.You have two choices: SMB (Server Message Block), which is simple to set up on PCs, or FTP (File Transfer Protocol), which can work both locally and remotely. FTP is almost universally supported by NAS boxes for remote-to-local backup, while for some reason, SMB isn’t always.</p>\n<p>Your NAS box might choose the protocol for you. WD, for instance, only supports FTP for backing up to the box, Seagate supports SMB and FTP, while Synology doesn’t support either on many of its less-expensive boxes.</p>\n<p>The chart lists some of the more popular NAS box vendors and which protocols they support for remote to local backup.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0087-0160/397204-1-eng-US/f0087-012.jpg\" width=\"498\" height=\"227\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0087-01\" title=\"f0087-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>Not every NAS box manufacturer supports both the SMB and FTP protocols. Synology supports both, but only on its more-expensive models.</b></p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>FILE SHARING/SMB</b></h3><p>The simplest way to back up computers on a local network is via SMB. It’s the standard network protocol for Windows PCs, and is what is used by Windows simply as <i>file sharing.</i>But it’s also supported by Macs and Linux PCs. In fact most NAS boxes run some form of Linux.</p>\n<p>The basic concept here is to enable sharing for each folder on your PCs you want to back up, then simply point the NAS box to those shares and tell it to back them up. Personally, I share entire drives, then select the folders to back up using the app on the NAS box, but sharing only specific folders is fine as well. Make note of the IP address, user name and password for every PC you want to back up. Next is a step-by-step description of how to enable sharing a folder on Windows.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0088-0162/397197-1-eng-US/f0088-012.jpg\" width=\"361\" height=\"495\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0088-01\" title=\"f0088-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>Setting up a Windows PC starts in the S<i>haring</i> tab in the <i>Properties dialog</i> that pops up when you right-click on a drive or folder and select <i>Properties</i> from the context menu.</p>\n<p>Once the dialog is open, click on <i>Advanced Sharing</i>. In the dialog, check <i>Share this folder</i>, then click on <i>Permissions</i>. Depending on the folder, you might see your user name, or <i>Everyone</i> in the list of users.</p>\n<p>To limit permissions to a single user:</p>\n<p><b>1.</b> Select <i>Everyone</i>, then click <i>Remove</i>.</p>\n<p><b>2.</b> To add a user (required), click on <i>Add</i>, and in the next dialog, type in your user name or the name of the user you’ll be logging on with from the NAS box. Click on the <i>Check</i><i>Name</i> button make sure it’s a legitimate choice and you’ve spelled it correctly. If you have, Windows will underline it, and put the name of your PC or domain in front of it. Click <i>Okay</i>, and you’ll return to the previous dialog.</p>\n<p><b>3.</b> If all you want is to back up the drive or folder, de-select <i>Full Control</i> and <i>Write</i>, leaving <i>Read</i> checked.</p>\n<p>That’s all there is to it for a Windows PC.</p>\n<p>It’s even easier on a Mac as almost everything is already shared by default, but you need to turn on SMB sharing for the user you want to log on as before it will be accessible by the NAS box.</p>\n<h3><b>FTP</b></h3><p>SMB is the easiest for computers on your local network, but how about your mother’s PC across town? Or even your downtown office PC? FTP, one of the oldest file transfer technologies around, is just the ticket.</p>\n<p>Setting up your PC as an FTP server takes a few steps, but is not at all difficult. This example is based on Windows 10, but the process will be similar with other versions.</p>\n<p>&gt; Open the Control Panel and go to <i>Programs → Turn Windows features on and off</i>.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0089-0145/397190-1-eng-US/f0089-012.jpg\" width=\"523\" height=\"316\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0089-01\" title=\"f0089-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>Setting up SMB on the Mac is easier than Windows, and most folders are already shared.</b></p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>&gt; Scroll down to <i>Internet Information Services</i>, expand it, and check the <i>FTP</i> box.</p>\n<p>&gt; Make sure <i>FTP Extensibility</i> and <i>FTP service</i> are both checked.</p>\n<p>&gt; Hit okay and the FTP server will be installed.</p>\n<p>Close the control panel, type <i>IIS</i> into the search field on the task bar, and select the <i>Internet Information Services</i> app that will appear. (See image on the next page.)</p>\n<p><b>1.</b> Look in the far left column for a folder called <i>Sites</i>. Right-click on <i>Sites</i> and select <i>Add FTP site</i>….</p>\n<p><b>2.</b> In the dialog that pops up, give the site a name, such as “MomsFTP,” and browse to the directory that you want as the main source for the site. This will be the directory or folder you want to back up, although if you prefer, you could back up files from other locations to that folder as well. You can add other folders to the site later.</p>\n<p><b>3.</b> Hit next and from the drop-down IP menu select the IP address of the PC you’re on. If you don’t know this, look under<i>Control Panel → Network and internet → Network and sharing center → Active Network → Connection → Details → IPV4</i>. This assumes you’re using a normal home router and haven’t switched to IPV6.</p>\n<p><b>4.</b> Make sure Start FTP site automatically is selected, then select <i>No SSL</i> (assuming only local access from your home network), or leave it unselected if you’ll be backing up from a remote location, and again click <i>Next</i>.</p>\n<p><b>5.</b> On the next page, leave <i>Basic security</i> checked. Only check <i>Anonymous access</i> if you want everyone to be able to see the site without entering a username and password. This is probably a bad idea for most of us. The username and password will be the Windows username and password for the PC you’re setting up.</p>\n<p><b>6.</b> Click <i>Finish</i> and your site should be up and running.</p>\n<p>To add additional folders to the site, right-click on the name of the FT<i>P site in</i> the column to the left (once it’s up and running), and select Add Virtual Directory. The<i>n simply browse to the folder (or drive) you want and add it. Easy Peasy. Note: Depend</i>ing on your NAS box, you might need to switch between MS-DOS and UNIX browsing under IIS → FTP site → Directory browsing. Otherwise, folder names may not appear.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0090-0154/397183-1-eng-US/f0090-012.jpg\" width=\"627\" height=\"384\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0090-01\" title=\"f0090-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>You can create FTP sites using the Windows Internet Information Services console, after you’ve enabled it under Control Panel → Programs → Add or remote programs → Turn Windows features on and off.</b></p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>SET UP YOUR MAC AS AN FTP SITE</b></h3><p>To enable the FTP server on MacOS, open a Terminal, paste the following at the command prompt, and hit enter:</p>\n<p><b>sudo -s launchctl load -w / System/Library/LaunchDaemons/ftp. plist</b></p>\n<p>To disable the FTP server, paste this and hit enter.</p>\n<p><b>sudo -s launchctl unload -w / System/Library/LaunchDaemons/ftp. plist</b></p>\n<p>Unlike with Windows, all folders will be available by default. Yes, it’s easier than Windows once you get past using the Terminal. Note that drives and their contents are found under the <i>Volumes</i> folder.</p>\n<h3><b>SET UP YOUR NAS BOX TO BACK UP</b></h3><p>Now for the fun part: Setting up the backup job on your NAS box. I don’t have the room to lay out specific instructions for every NAS box, but it basically goes like this: Open the backup program, select the local directory to receive the backup, choose the SMB or FTP protocol, browse to the IP address of the source and select the folder you want to back up to the box, and then adjust the schedule to taste.</p>\n<p>As mentioned previously, you’ll need three pieces of information to do this: the IP address of the remote PC to be backed up (local and/or public if it’s remote), the user name for the computer, and the password for that user. The NAS box needs this information to find your PC and log on. You might also need the paths of the drives or folders you’ll want to back up, depending on whether your NAS box lets you browse the destination. Most will, with the notable exception of Netgear when using FTP.</p>\n<p>As I mainly use a QNAP HS-251, here are the specific instructions for that box. Others will be similar.</p>\n<p>If you haven’t installed <i>Hybrid Backup Sync</i>, go the the <i>Apps</i> section and install it. Many other NAS boxes—such as WD’s and Seagate’s—will already have any backup features pre-installed. From the <i>Overview</i> page, select <i>Sync</i>. Yes, we’re going to do a one-way sync, which is like a mirror of your source. If you want a true backup, i.e. a point-in-time saved image, you’ll need to use other means.</p>\n<p><b>1.</b> Check <i>One-way Sync</i> and then select <i>Sync with remote server</i>.</p>\n<p><b>2.</b> Select <i>Remote to local sync</i>.</p>\n<p><b>3.</b> If you’re going to use normal file sharing, select <i>CIFS/SMB</i>, if you’re going to use <i>FTP</i>, select that.</p>\n<p><b>4.</b> In the <i>Create Sync Job</i> dialog that pops up, give the job a meaningful name such as “Office PC to NAS” and then click on the <i>Settings</i> button below that.</p>\n<p><b>5.</b> In the <i>Add Remote Connection</i> dialog that pops up, give the remote PC a meaningful name such as “Office-PC”, type in its IP address, the user name you want to log on as, and that user’s password. In the folder, type in the share name.</p>\n<p><b>6.</b><i>Test</i>. If you entered everything correctly, and the remote PC is online, you will see <i>Succeed</i>. Click okay and exit.</p>\n<p>Now it’s just a matter of selecting the Local destination folders and Remote source folders from the NAS box and the remote PC. Click Add for each pairing and then save the job.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0092-0148/397176-1-eng-US/f0092-012.jpg\" width=\"762\" height=\"470\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0092-01\" title=\"f0092-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>Once you’ve opened Hybrid Backup Sync, you’ll want to go to FTP or CIFS/SMB under the remote to local sync menu.</b></p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>SCHEDULING</b></h3><p>If there’s anything at all tricky about using your NAS box and SMB/FTP to back up your stuff, it’s making sure that everything is on when the backup is scheduled to run. In my experience, the backup process requires so little effort on the part of the PC being backed up that it’s unnoticeable, so I set the backup for times I know I’ll most likely be using the PC.</p>\n<p>There’s a backup running as I write and there is absolutely nothing to indicate that the operation is taking place. No slowdowns, no dialogs, no nothing. The only reason I know it’s in progress is checking with the NAS box via its web browser interface. I truly love it.</p>\n<h3><b>CLOUD SYNC</b></h3><p>All NAS boxes feature apps that will sync with online services. Which services and how many of them varies, but the most important are those used for backup by phones: Google Drive and OneDrive. Alas, Apple doesn’t allow access to iCloud from anything other than its own apps. If you’re an iPhone user, I recommend using DropBox.</p>\n<p>QNAP is definitely the heavyweight in terms of the number of other services it supports: Google Drive, Dropbox, Amazon S3, Microsoft Azure, and OneDrive to mention just a few, so this is another item to check when you’re shopping. I’m not going into setting up your phone to back up to the cloud. They all do, so read the instructions.</p>\n<p>Setting up these apps is almost exactly the same as it is from other devices. Generally, the setup will take you quickly to the site of the service where you can okay access by the NAS box and you’re all done. You might have to define a folder to store the synced data, but that’s about it.</p>\n<h3><b>CAVEATS</b></h3><p>I haven’t talked about the security of these operations. They are generally safe, but obviously not suitable for defense contractors. I have no problem using these methods, and I have for decades, but I’m not paranoid about my stuff—there’s nothing there that I care if someone steals. Lost in many security discussions is the theft-worthiness of your data. Worry about credit- card numbers and financial data such as tax returns, not an ebook collection.</p>\n<p>Also what I’ve described is actually a one-way sync, rather than a true static, point-in-time backup. You can, however, define a job as one-time and then change the destination folders. I generally just let my jobs run regularly, then once every few months I also create an image backup. (Using Paragon Backup and Recovery or R-Drive Image.)</p>\n<h3><b>FINAL WORDS</b></h3><p>Warnings aside, the absolute best thing about using a NAS box and this methodology is that once it’s set up, it’s completely transparent and requires zero intervention under normal circumstances. That’s very important as it’s become abundantly clear over my two decades of writing about backup that the hardest part is actually getting around to doing it.</p>\n<p>Once you’ve set your NAS box up, you’ll probably forget it’s running. But if data disaster strikes, you’ll have a big ol’ grin on your face once you remember that you did this.</p>\n","layout":{},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":0,"link_source":"","competition":[],"flatplan_title":"","notes":"","gutter_credit":"","other":"","image":[{"id":"d6cf973c827c24f436bfb5c4c6309e1e","name":"NAS-hub-image","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/nas-hub-image/399143-1-eng-US/nas-hub-image.jpg?t=default_ipad_portrait&ext/nas-hub-image_default_ipad_portrait.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"768","height":"546","legacy_id":"26674","is_default":true},{"id":"d6cf973c827c24f436bfb5c4c6309e1e","name":"NAS-hub-image","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/nas-hub-image/399143-1-eng-US/nas-hub-image.jpg?t=default_ipad_landscape&ext/nas-hub-image_default_ipad_landscape.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"1024","height":"728","legacy_id":"26674","is_default":false}],"related_objects":{"image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_5_1492428278.3671","name":"f0092-01","source":"","caption":"<p><b>Once

Of those surveyed, 62 percent said the Mac is as easy or easier to deploy than a PC, and 93 percent said it’s as easy or easier to deploy an iPhone or iPad over another device.</p>\n<p>While most IT professionals found Apple’s products easier to manage overall, that was not the case when it comes to Mac integration. Only <a href=\"https://www.jamf.com/resources/2016-survey-managing-apple-devices-in-the-enterprise/?sourcePath=16surveyapplent\" target=\"_self\">36 percent</a> of IT professionals claimed that it was easy or easier to integrate Macs into other environments. The survey is based on responses from 300 IT professionals and was commissioned by Jamf, the software management firm that focuses solely on Apple devices.</p>\n<p>In addition, the survey found that a whopping 99 percent of companies have iOS devices in use, while 90 percent use Macs. Jamf speculates that Apple’s penetration in enterprise is being fueled by device choice programs, with user preference leaning toward Apple devices.</p>\n<p>According to the survey, 71 percent of companies offered employees a choice between an iPhone, an Android device, or a Windows phone, while 44 percent offered them their choice between a Mac or PC. Employees’ use of Apple devices also went up in 2016, with 76 percent of companies seeing an increase in iOS adoption and 74 percent seeing an increase in Mac adoption.</p>\n<p>Jamf cites IBM as an example of a device choice program that led to the world’s largest Mac deployment for enterprise. Since 2015, IBM has deployed almost 100,000 Macs. According to IBM’s internal survey, 73 percent of its employees choose a Mac as their next computer. Similar to the enterprise, the education sector agrees that Macs and iPads are easier to manage than other devices.</p>\n<p>User preference was also a key factor driving adoption of Apple products in education, according to the survey. Ninety percent of K-12 schools use iPads, and 70 percent use Macs. In higher education, 94 percent have iOS users and 80 percent use Macs, the survey found.</p>\n<p>“Similar to the enterprise, the education sector agrees that Mac and iPad are easier to manage than other devices,” <a href=\"https://www.jamf.com/resources/survey-mac-iphone-and-ipad-are-easier-to-manage-than-rival-devices/\" target=\"_self\">read the press release</a>.</p>\n<p>These findings may seem to counter an earlier report that found a decrease in shipments of Apple products <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/02/technology/apple-products-schools-education.html?sourcePath=nytappledu&amp;_r=0\" target=\"_self\">to K-12 schools</a>. That report, however, was based on new shipments, not already installed products. So, while more Chromebooks may have shipped to schools in 2016, it’s possible that Macs still account for a higher percentage of laptops installed in classrooms.</p>\n<p><b>Why this matters:</b> Despite just recently starting to lose ground to Google, Apple’s grip on education is not necessarily loosening. After all, it was just in 2013 when nearly half of all products shipped to classrooms came from Apple. And those products have not yet been replaced by Chromebooks or Windows tablets, at least according to the Jamf survey.</p>\n","layout":{},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":0,"link_source":"","competition":[],"flatplan_title":"","notes":"","gutter_credit":"","other":"","image":[{"id":"8438ff487783865b5d6447a8d9f014f3","name":"IT","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/it/399150-1-eng-US/it.jpg?t=default_ipad_portrait&ext/it_default_ipad_portrait.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"768","height":"602","legacy_id":"26675","is_default":true},{"id":"8438ff487783865b5d6447a8d9f014f3","name":"IT","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/it/399150-1-eng-US/it.jpg?t=default_ipad_landscape&ext/it_default_ipad_landscape.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"980","height":"768","legacy_id":"26675","is_default":false}],"related_objects":{"image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1492428282.39","name":"f0094-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0094-0139/397240-1-eng-US/f0094-012.jpg?t=default_ipad_portrait&ext/f0094-012_default_ipad_portrait.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"768","height":"416","legacy_id":"26583"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1492428282.39","name":"f0094-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0094-0139/397240-1-eng-US/f0094-012.jpg?t=default_ipad_landscape&ext/f0094-012_default_ipad_landscape.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"1024","height":"554","legacy_id":"26583"}]},"url_alias":"http://macworld-us.audiencemedia.com","type":"story","order":"19","folio_number":"94","folio_numbers":"94","pdf_page_index":"94","thumbnail":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/it/399150-1-eng-US/it.jpg?t=tablet_story_thumbnail&ext/it_tablet_story_thumbnail.jpg","color":"2699cd","real_id":"28793","main_section_id":"1424","ads":[]},{"id":"0a55a3298343ce94e7d13da8f9363b3d","title":"How to take best advantage of iCloud Desktop and Documents across Macs","sub_title":"","author":[{"id":"0","name":"OSCAR RAYMUNDO","email":"noreply@audiencemedia.com","is_default":false}],"tag":"","strap_line":"ICLOUD DESKTOP AND DOCUMENTS","intro":"But Mac integration could use some work.","body":"<p class=\"byline\"><b>BY OSCAR RAYMUNDO</b></p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/icloud/399157-1-eng-US/icloud.jpg\" width=\"1145\" height=\"828\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"icloud\" title=\"icloud\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p><b>G</b>ordon Potter has considered using iCloud Desktop and Documents, a macOS Sierra feature that both syncs and selectively archives less-used files to free up storage, retrieving them on demand as needed. But, he is concerned that once he create/use this iCloud system, there is no obvious way out.</p>\n<p>This is a reasonable degree of concern. Gordon wonders in particular:</p>\n<p><b>1.</b> Does it sync across Macs registered to the same iCloud account and, if so, can he select what syncs?</p>\n<p><b>2</b>.

If not, you can still access those files via iCloud Drive. However, if you turn it on for multiple Macs with Sierra, the same Desktop and Documents folders appear on each Mac.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0097-0137/397269-1-eng-US/f0097-012.jpg\" width=\"630\" height=\"467\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0097-01\" title=\"f0097-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>You can disable Desktop and Documents sync without losing your data.

This confuses people a-plenty, because at first glance, it appears as if all the files are deleted! This feature doesn’t merge multiple Desktop and Documents folders, but rather just retains them in this fashion.</p>\n<p>You can’t select what’s synced. For that, you need Dropbox, which offers Selective Sync, and plans to improve on that in the future. (As Gordon currently uses for some purposes.)</p>\n<p>Beware when turning this feature on that you’re not too hasty when things start to disappear. If you have files that take up gigabytes of storage, it may seem like things have been deleted while it’s in progress. If you cancel the process, you can wind up in an ugly indeterminate state that requires a lot of effort to get back to normal.</p>\n<p><b>Turning it off.</b> You can simply uncheck the box <i>Desktop &amp; Documents Folder</i> in the iCloud system preference pane’s iCloud Drive’s Options dialog. macOS then moves the Desktop and Documents folder into the iCloud Drive, and the Desktop on your Mac appears empty, as does the Documents folder in your user account. All the files are still there! But you have to now choose to select and copy (drag) or move (Command-drag) the files back to their original locations.</p>\n<p><b>Using Desktop and Documents for exchanging files.</b> When you’re using different iCloud accounts or Apple IDs, this feature doesn’t offer any way to share files. And iCloud Drive as a whole also lacks this seemingly obvious and useful feature. For this, you still need to rely on Dropbox.</p>\n","layout":{},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":0,"link_source":"","competition":[],"flatplan_title":"","notes":"","gutter_credit":"","other":"","image":[{"id":"18a793bb4addf3ba90468ed05ff2fe6f","name":"icloud","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/icloud/399157-1-eng-US/icloud.jpg?t=default_ipad_portrait&ext/icloud_default_ipad_portrait.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"768","height":"555","legacy_id":"26676","is_default":true},{"id":"18a793bb4addf3ba90468ed05ff2fe6f","name":"icloud","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/icloud/399157-1-eng-US/icloud.jpg?t=default_ipad_landscape&ext/icloud_default_ipad_landscape.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"1024","height":"740","legacy_id":"26676","is_default":false}],"related_objects":{"image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_1_1492428283.414","name":"f0097-01","source":"","caption":"<p><b>You can disable Desktop and Documents sync without losing your data.
