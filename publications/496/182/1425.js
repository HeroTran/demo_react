In this column, I answer a couple of those questions and explain some of the changes in iTunes 12.6. Apple has— finally—brought back the ability to open playlists in their own windows. And the MiniPlayer, that small floating window that lets you control iTunes, has been updated. Read on to find out what’s new in iTunes 12.6.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0102-0137/397319-1-eng-US/f0102-012.jpg\" width=\"812\" height=\"665\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0102-01\" title=\"f0102-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>Here’s a playlist in its own window, open in front of the main iTunes window.</b></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>PLAYLIST WINDOWS</b></h3><p><b>Q: I remember that, some time ago, I could open playlists in iTunes in their own windows. Will Apple ever bring that feature back?</b></p>\n<p><b>A:</b> I get this question often, and just recently, when Apple updated iTunes to version 12.6, I was surprised to discover that this ability had been restored. Back in 2015, on my website, I wrote a series of articles about how I would <a href=\"http://www.kirkville.com/how-i-would-fix-itunes-part-3-multiple-windows/?sourcePath=fixit3\" target=\"_self\">fix iTunes</a>, and part 3 was about multiple windows. I asked for both playlist windows and for the ability—long available in iTunes—to open the iTunes Store in its own window.</p>\n<p>You can open a playlist in iTunes 12.6 in a window in two ways. The first is to right-click on a playlist and choose Open Playlist In New Window. The second is to press the Command key and double-click on a playlist. This is useful when you are working on a playlist and want to add songs from your library. You can have two windows open, and drag songs from your library to the playlist more easily. Or you can have multiple playlist windows open, to add songs to various playlists, or move them among existing playlists.</p>\n<p>There are some limitations to this, however. These playlist windows don’t show in iTunes’ Window menu, so there’s no easy way to switch to and from these windows when they’re hidden behind the main iTunes window. But you can cycle through the windows by pressing Command-~, so if you only have a few open, you can switch among them easily.</p>\n<p>While Apple followed part of my suggestion about multiple windows, they did not, however, restore the ability to open the iTunes Store in its own window. For now, you can only view the Store in the main iTunes window.</p>\n<h3><b>THE NEW MINIPLAYER</b></h3><p><b>Q: I’m used to using the MiniPlayer to control my listening with iTunes. But I updated to the latest version of iTunes, and it’s very different. I no longer see an artwork thumbnail, and it is much larger than before. What’s up with that?</b></p>\n<p><b>A:</b> iTunes 12.6 features a totally revamped MiniPlayer. You activate this by choosing Window → MiniPlayer. </p>\n<p>By default, the previous MiniPlayer displayed without artwork visible, but with a small thumbnail at the left of the window. Now, the first time you invoke the MiniPlayer, you see artwork.</p>\n<p>Here’s what it looks like:</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0103-0136/397312-1-eng-US/f0103-012.jpg\" width=\"362\" height=\"440\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0103-01\" title=\"f0103-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>The new MiniPlayer displays artwork by default.</b></p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>You can change this by hovering your cursor over the MiniPlayer window, which displays controls in the place of the track name, artist name, and album above, then clicking the ellipsis (…) button and choosing Hide MiniPlayer Large Artwork. You can also drag the window up from the bottom until the artwork disappears.</p>\n<p>Click the Up Next button at the right of the control section of the window to display your Up Next queue, and have access to your listening history, and to lyrics, if they are available. This isn’t new, but the display is much cleaner. (Note: the Clear button that used to be at the top of the list is now at the bottom.)</p>\n<p>Try resizing the window in different directions. If you resize it enough vertically, then move your cursor away, the controls disappear, and just artwork displays. Keep dragging up and the artwork disappears, and you get that simple controller. And you can drag to the right or left to expand the window (and then contract it going in the other direction).</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0104-0134/397305-1-eng-US/f0104-012.jpg\" width=\"566\" height=\"159\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0104-01\" title=\"f0104-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>Here’s the MiniPlayer in its smallest form, showing controllers, which display when you hover your cursor over the window.</b></p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>Ask the iTunes Guy</b></h3><p>Have questions of your own for the iTunes Guy?

href=\"http://www.macworld.com/article/3169375/videos/how-to-rip-dvds-with-handbrake.html\" target=\"_self\"> DVDs with the free HandBrake</a>. While the solution I describe in that article is easy to use, you might want to consider another way of ripping discs. You can do this using the free <a href=\"http://makemkv.com/\" target=\"_self\">MakeMKV</a>, and then using HandBrake. This has several advantages:</p>\n<p>&gt; There’s no need to install additional tools from the command line, as I explained in the “How to rip DVDs with HandBrake” article.</p>\n<p>&gt; You can also rip Blu-ray discs with MakeMKV and then convert these files to iTunes-compatible files.</p>\n<p>&gt; If you don’t want to store your videos in iTunes, you can play them with the <a href=\"http://www.videolan.org/\" target=\"_self\">free VLC media player</a>, and you can view them in the iOS version of VLC as well.</p>\n<p>&gt; And if you use <a href=\"http://www.macworld.com/article/3012244/streaming-media/the-best-way-to-watch-media-on-the-new-apple-tv-itunes-home-sharing-vs-plex.html?sourcePath=plexvsapl\" target=\"_self\">Plex</a> to manage and view videos, then you can use the MKV file as is; Plex can read and play this type of file, and it’s got great apps for iOS and the Apple TV.</p>\n<p>Here’s how to use MakeMKV to rip optical discs, and how to convert them with HandBrake.</p>\n<h3><b>GET SOFTWARE</b></h3><p>Get the free MakeMKV. (This app has been in beta forever, and you can get a free beta key from the <a href=\"https://www.makemkv.com/forum2/viewtopic.php?f=5&amp;t=1053\" target=\"_self\">developer’s forum</a>.) This app rips your DVD or Blu-ray disc and converts it to an MKV file. You cannot play the MKV file in Apple’s apps—iTunes, or on an iOS device—but you can use the file as a source for HandBrake to convert.</p>\n<p>Get the <a href=\"https://handbrake.fr/\" target=\"_self\">free HandBrake</a>.</p>\n<h3><b>GET HARDWARE</b></h3><p>You’ll need an optical drive to rip DVDs, and if you want to rip Blu-rays, you’ll need a Blu-ray drive (which can also rip CDs and DVDs). I have long used the Pioneer BDR-XD05B, which is a bus-powered drive (it doesn’t need a separate power supply) that supports USB 3. This drive is sturdy and reliable. While macOS doesn’t support Blu-ray discs, any software that can read such discs will be able to do so from this drive, or any other.</p>\n<h3><b>USE MAKEMKV</b></h3><p>Launch MakeMKV, insert a disc in your optical drive, then click the big button that looks like an optical drive. MakeMKV will read the disc, then display its contents.</p>\n<p>If you click the disclosure triangle next to the disc, you can choose to exclude different parts of a disc, such as the main feature and bonuses, or different episodes for a TV series; you can also exclude any audio and subtitle tracks you don’t need.</p>\n<p>EDITOR’S NOTE: <i>The MPAA and most media companies argue that you can’t legally copy or convert commercial DVDs and Blu-ray discs for any reason. We (and others) think that, if you own a DVD or Blu-ray disc, you should be able to override its copy protection to make a backup copy or to convert its content for viewing on other devices. See <a href=\"http://go.macworld.com/ripfaq\" target=\"_self\">go.macworld.com/ripfaq</a>. The law isn’t entirely clear one way or the other. So our advice is: If you don’t own it, don’t do it. If you do own it, think before you rip.</i></p>\n<p>Click the MakeMKV button, and wait for the app to create the file. (If your disc has multiple titles, you’ll have one file for each.)</p>\n<p>Note that ripping Blu-rays can take a long time; on my 5K iMac, it takes about as long as the duration of the video (i.e., a 2-hour movie takes two hours to rip). And the resulting files can be quite large, as much as 30GB to 40GB.</p>\n<p class=\"pullQuote\">Note that ripping Blu-rays can take a long time; on my 5K iMac, it takes about as long as the duration of the video.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0107-0131/397369-1-eng-US/f0107-012.jpg\" width=\"767\" height=\"661\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0107-01\" title=\"f0107-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>The MakeMKV interface lets you select which elements from a disc you want to rip.</b></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>If you want to store your videos in MKV format, you can stop here.

I won’t go into detail here about how to do this. My previous article explains how to rip a DVD with HandBrake. When you have an MKV file, you choose it as a source in HandBrake, and follow the same procedure as with a DVD.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0109-0131/397355-1-eng-US/f0109-012.jpg\" width=\"277\" height=\"278\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0109-01\" title=\"f0109-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>If you want to retain your videos in MKV format but save space, you can use HandBrake to convert these videos to smaller MKV files. In the Presets drawer, click the disclosure triangle next to Matroska (MKV stands for Matroska video) and choose one of the presets. I recommend using the H.264 MKV 1080p30 preset for Blu-rays, and the H.264 MKV 576p26 or H.264 MKV 480p30 presets for DVDs. (See my previous HandBrake article for an explanation of the difference between 576 and 480 line videos.) H.265 is a newer compression codec that might not be supported on all your devices, and VP8 and VP9 are codecs designed by Google, which you may not be able to play on Apple devices.</p>\n<p>In my experience, converting a 30GB to 40GB MKV file (a 2- to 3-hour movie) to an .m4v file with HandBrake results in a file about 6GB to 10GB. Converting the same MKV file using the H.264 MKV 1080p30 preset gives you a much smaller file, around 3Gb to 4GB. And the conversion takes about as long as the duration of the video on my 5K iMac, so ripping and converting a 2-hour movie takes about four hours altogether.</p>\n<p>So you have several options: rip a DVD with HandBrake, or rip a DVD or Blu-ray disc with MakeMKV. And you can then choose to create an Apple-compatible file to use with iTunes and iOS devices, or use an MKV file with other apps, such as VLC or Plex. No matter which method you choose, you’ll be able to easily rip any of your optical discs and digitize some or all of your video collection. The only other thing you need is time.</p>\n","layout":{},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":0,"link_source":"","competition":[],"flatplan_title":"","notes":"","gutter_credit":"","other":"","image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1492428289.3111","name":"f0105-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0105-0131/397376-1-eng-US/f0105-012.jpg?t=default_ipad_portrait&ext/f0105-012_default_ipad_portrait.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"768","height":"423","legacy_id":"26599","is_default":true},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1492428289.3111","name":"f0105-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0105-0131/397376-1-eng-US/f0105-012.jpg?t=default_ipad_landscape&ext/f0105-012_default_ipad_landscape.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"1024","height":"564","legacy_id":"26599","is_default":false}],"related_objects":{"image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_3_1492428287.6751","name":"f0109-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0109-0131/397355-1-eng-US/f0109-012.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"277","height":"278","legacy_id":"26596"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_3_1492428287.6751","name":"f0109-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0109-0131/397355-1-eng-US/f0109-012.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"277","height":"278","legacy_id":"26596"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_2_1492428288.1753","name":"f0108-01","source":"","caption":"<p><b>HandBrake’s Matroska presets let you convert an MKV file to a smaller file in the same format.</b></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0108-0136/397362-1-eng-US/f0108-012.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"799","height":"471","legacy_id":"26597"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_2_1492428288.1753","name":"f0108-01","source":"","caption":"<p><b>HandBrake’s Matroska presets let you convert an MKV file to a smaller file in the same format.</b></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0108-0136/397362-1-eng-US/f0108-012.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"799","height":"471","legacy_id":"26597"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_1_1492428288.7413","name":"f0107-01","source":"","caption":"<p><b>The MakeMKV interface lets you select which elements from a disc you want to rip.</b></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0107-0131/397369-1-eng-US/f0107-012.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"767","height":"661","legacy_id":"26598"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_1_1492428288.7413","name":"f0107-01","source":"","caption":"<p><b>The MakeMKV interface lets you select which elements from a disc you want to rip.</b></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0107-0131/397369-1-eng-US/f0107-012.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"767","height":"661","legacy_id":"26598"}]},"url_alias":"http://macworld-us.audiencemedia.com","type":"story","order":"22","folio_number":"105","folio_numbers":"105","pdf_page_index":"105","thumbnail":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0105-0131/397376-1-eng-US/f0105-012.jpg?t=tablet_story_thumbnail&ext/f0105-012_tablet_story_thumbnail.jpg","color":"2699cd","real_id":"28799","main_section_id":"1425","ads":[]}],"type":null,"ads":[]}}
