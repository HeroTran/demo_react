They have two iPhoto Libraries that I copied over to the new iMac. Now, on the new iMac, there are three Photos Libraries. I have no idea how the extra libraries came about. Is there a way to merge the iPhoto Libraries and the Photos Libraries so we</b><b>can see all of them together in one library in Photos?</b></p>
<p class="ezoeAlignright text-right"><i>— Bryan Packer</i></p>
<p><b>A:</b> This seems to be a multiplication problem. Each iPhoto Library, when opened in Photos, becomes a Photos library. So on launching Photos with the Option key held down, you should see both old iPhoto libraries and both new Photos libraries. The third Photos library may have been created during setting up the Mac, and contains no images, although you can select it using the Option key launch sequence to make sure.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Apple’s greatest missing piece in iPhoto and Photos is the ability to move photos and albums among libraries and to merge them. For that, I routinely recommend the only third-party option out there, <a href="https://www.fatcatsoftware.com/powerphotos/" target="_self">PowerPhotos</a>, which costs $30 for a bundle of itself and the developer’s previous tool, iPhoto Library Manager. (You can see our review of PowerPhotos 1.1; it’s now at <a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/3007385/photography/powerphotos-11-review-now-with-library-merges-album-copy-and-search-across-libraries.html?sourcePath=powerphotos" target="_self">version 1.2.2</a>.)</p>

    </div><h3><b>How to fix a persistent iCloud approval request on your iPhone</b></h3><p>Mary Gascho has a persistent pest. After upgrading her iPhone, “I am constantly getting an ‘approval request sent’ popup.” The message tells her that if she wants to keep using iCloud, she needs to approve that from another device that is using the same iCloud account.</p>
<p>This appears to be related to iCloud Keychain based on reports from other people having the persistent problem. My colleague Joe Kissell wrote a thorough rundown in 2013 on using <a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/2058081/how-to-use-icloud-keychain.html?sourcePath=icloudkey" target="_self">iCloud Keychain</a>, including approving access from one device for another, and that’s remained largely unchanged.</p>
<p>However, Mary’s problem and that of others doesn’t seem to be alleviated by using his directions. Her old phone, which is still active, isn’t giving her a way to approve access on the new one. Other users have found a way to clear this message without losing access to iCloud:</p>

<h3><b>What you can do if you forget your password on a FileVaultprotected Mac</b></h3><p>Several readers have asked recently about what to do with systems they’ve purchased, inherited, or were given to them that were protected by <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204837?sourcePath=filevaulthelp" target="_self">FileVault</a> and the original owner can’t recall or provide the password.</p>
<p>FileVault protects in two parts: You know the first, which is that while a Mac is at rest (that is, powered down), its startup drive remains strongly encrypted, so even if the data is extracted, it’s unusable to another party.</p>
<p>But it also protects the startup process. Because the disk is encrypted, macOS can’t boot into your main system on the startup volume. Instead, it boots a special part of the Recovery Disk, a partition you normally use for emergencies. That boot process presents a login screen that looks similar to the main macOS login, but only contains accounts that have FileVault-access enabled.</p>
<p>Behind the scenes, after you enter the password correctly for one of those accounts, macOS decrypts the volume encryption key and passes the boot to the startup partition along with the affirmation that you’ve logged in correctly.</p>
<p>You can recover a lost FileVault password or erase a FileVault drive, losing everything but regaining the ability to use the system.</p>
<p>(Now if I were suspicious, I’d wonder if the emails I’ve received were from people who had obtained systems illegitimately, and were trying to crack into them or reformat a system that they’d potentially obtained through another party who might not have had full authority to give it to them. However, each email I’ve received sounded fully plausible, and most had personal details attached.)</p>

    </div><p><b>If you don’t have a valid password, you can try to recover one.</b> Apple has <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-au/HT202860?sourcePath=keychainlogin" target="_self">full instructions</a>, but it requires that you either cached your password in iCloud—which doesn’t work for another party who doesn’t have access to your account—or the person who enabled FileVault created a recovery key that they can provide to you. (Rich Trouton wrote up an extensive <a href="http://go.macworld.com/fv2recvry" target="_self">blog entry</a> on the recovery process in 2015 that remains valuable.)</p>
<p><b>Erase via Recovery.</b> Hold down Command- R at startup (Option by itself won’t work on a FileVault-protected Mac), and then erase the FileVault partition using Disk Utility, and then reinstall macOS. This may not always work, in which case you have two other options.</p>
<p><b>Erase via another startup drive.</b> File- Vault protects the startup drive from access, but you can hold down Option at startup and select other attached drives’ volumes that have valid macOS (or OS X) startup partitions. Boot from one of those, and you simply wipe the FileVault drive. You’ll need to reinstall macOS entirely on that drive to wipe out the Recovery Disk settings.</p>
<p><b>Use Internet Recovery.</b> At startup, hold down Command-Option-R, and you can select Reinstall macOS. This retrieves macOS over the Internet, which can take a while if you have a slow connection.</p>
