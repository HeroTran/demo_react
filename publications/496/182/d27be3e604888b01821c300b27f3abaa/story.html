    </div><h3>APPLE’S NIKE SPORT BAND</h3><p><a href="https://www.apple.com/" target="_self">Apple</a> made several product updates this spring, introducing a slew of new bands for the Apple Watch. We’re really feeling the $49 Nike Sport Band. This perforated band is designed to let maximum air flow reach your wrist, which you might appreciate if you wear your Apple Watch during grueling, sweaty workouts. This band wasn’t sold separately before—you could only get it with the Nike+ edition of the Apple Watch Series 2. Now you can pick one up for any Apple Watch you already own in three official colorways: black/volt (“volt” is a bright neon yellow), platinum/white (platinum is gray), and anthracite/black (all black). <b>—SUSIE OCHS</b></p>

    </div><h3>CASETIFY iPHONE 7 CASES AND COVERS</h3><p>You’ve got your gorgeous new red iPhone 7, and you’ve managed to make it this far without dropping it, scratching it, or throwing it against a wall—congrats! But now it’s time to get back to the real world and slap a case on that thing. We love <a href="https://www.casetify.com/" target="_self">Casetify’s</a> collection of customizable clear cases, which typically run $40 a pop. These polycarbonate cases have a glossy transparent back and a matte, soft-touch frame for extra grip. The frame comes in seven different colors (including clear, black, and red), and Casetify has several different backplate designs to pick from— including this cute bow, pictured here. <b>—SARAH JACOBSSON PUREWAL</b></p>

    </div><h3><b>PIXIE SMART TAGS</b></h3><p>If you constantly misplace important objects—like your keys, wallet, or Apple TV remote—a smart tracking device like the <a href="https://getpixie.com/" target="_self">Pixie</a> ($50 for a set of two) could help. On the surface, Pixie isn’t much different than other smart tracking devices. You need two teardrop-shaped smart tags called Pixie Points—one attached to your iPhone or iPad, another on the object you want to keep tabs on. Points use proprietary signaling to remain in constant communication with each other, triangulating your location for increased accuracy. To find your missing object, Pixie will scour the area for Pixie Points located within a 30 to 50 feet indoor area or up to 150 feet outside. When it’s been found, AR “pixie dust” appears on-screen, at which point the hunt is on. <b>—J.R. BOOKWALTER</b></p>
