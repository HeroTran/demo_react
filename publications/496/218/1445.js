The current iMac was released in October of 2015, well past the yearly updates Apple used to issue. So the iMac is due.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0008-0129/438291-1-eng-US/f0008-012.jpg\" width=\"764\" height=\"628\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0008-01\" title=\"f0008-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n <span class=\"credit\">\nImage: Pixabay</span></figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>Pike’s <a href=\"http://pikeralpha.wordpress.com\" target=\"_self\">Universum</a>, which has an eagle eye for finding references to future Apple products in Apple’s operating system code, reported on some specs that could be used for the new iMac—though the site says that the information should be “handled with care/skepticism.” I’ll point out Pike’s findings in each section I discuss, along with my commentary.</p>\n<h3><b>THE LATEST CPUS</b></h3><p>Pike’s Universum says that the high-end iMac could have an Intel E3-1285 v6 processor. This is a Xeon processor that’s not on Intel’s E3 v6 <a href=\"http://go.macworld.com/e3v6\" target=\"_self\">Family list</a>, so you can either dismiss it as not true, or it could be a processor not yet developed. Intel does have older Xeon processors with the E3-1285 part number, so it does seem feasible.</p>\n<p>Intel released the E3-1200 v6 processor family in <a href=\"http://go.macworld.com/e31200v6\" target=\"_self\">late March</a>, so if there’s any credence to Pike’s report, it checks a box on my iMac wish list: that Apple use current CPUs, not ones that are a generation behind.</p>\n<p>It’ll be interesting if Apple decides to go with a quad-core Xeon processor, which is used in professional workstations. During the Mac Pro briefing, the iMac was mentioned as being used by professionals, and since a ship date for the future Mac Pro has not been announced, Apple could want to fill the professional demand in the meantime by offering a superfast iMac.</p>\n<p>Apple offers multiple models of the iMac, with 21.5- and 27-inch displays. You’ll probably see Core i5 or Core i7 processors in the 21.5-inch iMacs, and then a Xeon processor in the 27-inch model. Let’s hope those Core processors are from Intel’s <a href=\"http://go.macworld.com/10kbylk\" target=\"_self\">7th generation</a>.</p>\n<h3><b>16GB OF MEMORY</b></h3><p>Besdes the fast performance, another reason for using a Xeon processor in the high-end iMac is its support for Error Correction Code (ECC) RAM. ECC RAM has a chip that’s dedicated to finding and fixing memory errors. Standard RAM doesn’t have this capability, but it’s also less expensive. So you should experience fewer memory errors when using ECC RAM.</p>\n<p>What I’d like to see with the iMac is a standard configuration of 16GB of memory. Currently, it’s at 8GB. I’d also like to see Apple make the RAM user-accessible on all iMac models, not just on the high-end 27-incher, so you can upgrade to 32GB or 64GB at a later date.</p>\n<h3><b>MAKE FUSION DRIVES STANDARD</b></h3><p>A solid-state drive would be great because of the speed benefits, but it’s expensive and will drive the price of the iMac up. Apple currently stocks 1TB hard drives in its standard configurations of the iMac, and a 1TB SSD would be really pricey. Pike’s Universum says that the new high-end iMac could have an <a href=\"http://go.macworld.com/nvmeall\" target=\"_self\">NVMe SSD</a>, which would be awesome, but there’s still a price consideration for the lower-priced iMacs.</p>\n<p>A good compromise would be to make a <a href=\"http://go.macworld.com/fusndrv\" target=\"_self\">1TB Fusion Drive</a> standard. A Fusion Drive is a hard drive that’s combined with flash storage and seen on the Mac and a single storage device. This provides fast file access and spacious file storage.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0010-0158/438284-1-eng-US/f0010-012.jpg\" width=\"763\" height=\"542\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0010-01\" title=\"f0010-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>Ports on the Retina 5K iMac. Above the power cable is the cover where users can upgrade RAM.</b></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n <span class=\"credit\">\nImage: Roman Loyola</span></figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>A Fusion Drive upgrade for the current iMac is only $100. Hopefully Apple could find a way to offset the cost of making it a part of the standard configuration.</p>\n<p class=\"pullQuote\">You have to reach around and scrape up the back of the iMac as you try to fit a connector into a port.</p>\n<h3><b>EASIER TO ACCESS PORTS</b></h3><p>Apple puts its iMac ports on the back, because they’re ugly and they ruin the aesthetic of the iMac’s front appearance. If you need to regularly access those ports, however, it’s annoying. You have to reach around and scrape up the back of the iMac as you try to fit a connector into a port. Or you have to move the iMac itself, which can be disruptive if you have a special hardware setup.</p>\n<p>But Apple won’t move the ports from the back. Maybe they have data that shows that it’s not really an issue. Maybe the data they have says customers want a change, but Apple doesn’t care, it’s sticking to its design. I can wish, but I know that in this case, it won’t happen.</p>\n<h3><b>THUNDERBOLT 3/USB-C AND USB 3</b></h3><p>Here’s a wish that has a really good chance of coming true. I can easily see Apple replacing the Thunderbolt 2 ports on the current iMac with Thunderbolt 3/ USB-C on the new iMac.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0011-0136/438277-1-eng-US/f0011-012.jpg\" width=\"624\" height=\"440\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0011-01\" title=\"f0011-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>CalDigit’s TS 3 Lite docking station.</b></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n <span class=\"credit\">\nImage: Caldigit/Amazon</span></figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>I hope Apple retains the other ports on the back of the iMac: USB 3, ethernet, the headphone jack, and the SD card slot. I don’t see a reason for Apple to eliminate these ports, but I can also see Apple deciding to offer only Thunderbolt 3, and then telling people that you can use a dock like CalDigit’s <a href=\"http://go.macworld.com/tc3lite\" target=\"_self\">TS 3 Lite</a> ($200 <a href=\"http://go.macworld.com/tc3ltamz\" target=\"_self\">on Amazon</a>). That would mean paying extra money for something that used to be included. But on the bright side, a dock would address my issue with port access.</p>\n<h3><b>EXTERNAL GPU SUPPORT</b></h3><p>The iMac’s all-in-one design limits the type of GPU that can be used. You can’t use one that generates a lot of heat. But if lots of pros are using iMacs, a proclass GPU accessible externally would address the needs of graphically demanding apps.</p>\n<p>An external GPU is also on my <a href=\"http://go.macworld.com/mcprwl\" target=\"_self\">wish list for the Mac Pro</a>. In that article, I said that an external GPU is the type of product you usually wouldn’t see from Apple, but if it can be used by any Mac, it makes it more feasible. And as I noted in the Mac Pro wish list, macOS needs some updating to support an external GPU.</p>\n","layout":{"landscape":{"id":"am-landscape-13","link":"macuser_article_01-l.twig"},"portrait":{"id":"am-portrait-13","link":"macuser_article_01.twig"}},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":0,"link_source":"","competition":[],"flatplan_title":"","notes":"","gutter_credit":"","other":"","image":[{"id":"9e6d35beb03670f97adc337b4f85f1ef","name":"imac","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/imac5/468152-1-eng-US/imac.jpg?t=story_img_size_768x0&ext/imac_story_img_size_768x0.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"2000","height":"1149","legacy_id":"31547","is_default":true},{"id":"9e6d35beb03670f97adc337b4f85f1ef","name":"imac","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/imac5/468152-1-eng-US/imac.jpg?t=story_img_size_768x0&ext/imac_story_img_size_768x0.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"2000","height":"1149","legacy_id":"31547","is_default":false}],"related_objects":{"image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_3_1495463773.8501","name":"f0011-01","source":"Image: Caldigit/Amazon","caption":"<p><b>CalDigit’s TS 3 Lite docking station.</b></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0011-0136/438277-1-eng-US/f0011-012.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"624","height":"440","legacy_id":"29234"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_3_1495463773.8501","name":"f0011-01","source":"Image: Caldigit/Amazon","caption":"<p><b>CalDigit’s TS 3 Lite docking station.</b></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0011-0136/438277-1-eng-US/f0011-012.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"624","height":"440","legacy_id":"29234"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_2_1495463774.6263","name":"f0010-01","source":"Image: Roman Loyola","caption":"<p><b>Ports on the Retina 5K iMac.

Instead, the company held its cards close and let the rumor mill run amok. But lately, Apple is being much more open about its future. Expect new iMacs later <a href=\"http://go.macworld.%20com/mcpr\" target=\"_self\">this year</a>, company executives said earlier this month, but that’s not all: Apple plans to make all of its products with recycled materials.</p>\n<p>That means the end of mining metals from the earth, which is a tall order. Apple doesn’t have a time line for moving to a completely closedloop supply chain, said Lisa P. Jackson, the company’s vice president of environmental and social initiatives. Jackson, former head of the Environmental Protection Agency under President Barack Obama, told Vice News Tonight that Apple is trying to move the industry in the direction of sustainability.</p>\n<p>“We’re actually doing something we rarely do which is announce a goal before we completely figure out how to do it,” Jackson said. “We’re a little nervous, but we also think it’s really important because as a sector it’s where we believe technology should be going.” You can see Jackson’s full <a href=\"http://go.macworld.com/jacksonvn\" target=\"_self\">Vice News Tonight interview</a>.</p>\n<p>Liam, Apple’s iPhone-disassembling robot, will play a big part in recycling and reusing Apple’s own components to produce new devices. But there’s much more to it than that, which Apple is still trying to figure out.</p>\n<p>The company managed to move almost entirely to renewable energy to power its facilities within four years of announcing that goal, so it can be done. In 2016, 96 percent of the electricity Apple uses worldwide came from renewable energy. In 24 countries, it’s 100 percent renewable. The company is encouraging its suppliers to do the same, and seven have promised to power their Apple manufacturing with renewable energy by the end of 2018. Apple is also using 99 percent recycled and sustainably sourced paper for its packaging.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0013-0161/438327-1-eng-US/f0013-012.jpg\" width=\"543\" height=\"187\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0013-01\" title=\"f0013-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>Apple released its annual comprehensive environmental sustainability report, which covers its progress in fiscal 2016, and you can check it out in full <a href=\"http://go.macworld.com/aplenviro\" target=\"_self\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>The news of Apple’s new goal came just in time for Earth Day, which fell on April 22.

You may not have helped the earth with that workout, really, but you were probably already recycling your iPhones and being responsible in other ways. The Earth Day challenge was just for fun.</p>\n","layout":{"landscape":{"id":"am-landscape-14","link":"macuser_article_02-l.twig"},"portrait":{"id":"am-portrait-14","link":"macuser_article_02.twig"}},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":0,"link_source":"","competition":[],"flatplan_title":"","notes":"","gutter_credit":"","other":"","image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1495463778.1131","name":"f0012-01","source":"IMAGES: APPLE","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0012-0156/438334-1-eng-US/f0012-012.jpg?t=story_img_size_768x0&ext/f0012-012_story_img_size_768x0.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"975","height":"518","legacy_id":"29241","is_default":true},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1495463778.1131","name":"f0012-01","source":"IMAGES: APPLE","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0012-0156/438334-1-eng-US/f0012-012.jpg?t=story_img_size_768x0&ext/f0012-012_story_img_size_768x0.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"975","height":"518","legacy_id":"29241","is_default":false}],"related_objects":{"image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_1_1495463777.4376","name":"f0013-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0013-0161/438327-1-eng-US/f0013-012.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"543","height":"187","legacy_id":"29240"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_1_1495463777.4376","name":"f0013-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0013-0161/438327-1-eng-US/f0013-012.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"543","height":"187","legacy_id":"29240"}]},"url_alias":"http://macworld-us.audiencemedia.com","type":"story","order":"1","folio_number":"12","folio_numbers":"12,13","pdf_page_index":"12","thumbnail":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0012-0156/438334-1-eng-US/f0012-012.jpg?t=tablet_story_thumbnail&ext/f0012-012_tablet_story_thumbnail.jpg","color":"2699cd","real_id":"29239","main_section_id":"1445","ads":[]},{"id":"zinio_218_100340926_1495463779.1477","title":"Apple’s confusing method of device authorization and association","sub_title":"","author":[{"id":"0","name":"KIRK MCELHEARN","email":"noreply@audiencemedia.com","is_default":false}],"tag":"","strap_line":"Device Authorization","intro":"Why does it have to be so difficult when all you want to do is watch an iTunes video on one of your devices?","body":"<p class=\"byline\"><b>BY KIRK MCELHEARN</b></p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0014-0159/438377-1-eng-US/f0014-012.jpg\" width=\"763\" height=\"556\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0014-01\" title=\"f0014-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n <span class=\"credit\">\nIMAGES: APPLE</span></figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p><b>T</b>he iTunes Store was launched 14 years ago, and has morphed from its initial music-only offering to embrace all forms of digital media. It’s now just another digital purveyor among many, though still the leading seller of digital music in the world.</p>\n<p>While music files were protected with digital rights management (DRM) in the early years, it’s now been eight years since this was removed. But other types of content sold on the iTunes Store still have DRM: movies, TV shows, apps, audiobooks, ebooks, and ringtones. For these types of media with DRM, there are restrictions as to how many devices you can use.</p>\n<p>It gets complicated, though, because there are two types of restrictions. The first is for computers that are <i>authorized</i> to sync and play content from the <a href=\"http://go.macworld.com/playsync\" target=\"_self\">iTunes Store</a>, and the second is for devices that are allowed to <a href=\"http://go.macworld.com/dlplay\" target=\"_self\">download and play</a> iTunes Store purchases.</p>\n<p>Confusing, isn’t it? Trying to understand what these different categories cover, and then trying to manage your devices, can be a head-scratcher.</p>\n<p>Let’s start with authorized computers. As Apple says, “You can authorize up to 5 computers, which means that you can play your content on 5 different computers.” To authorize a computer, you start playing some protected content—say, a movie or TV show—and enter your Apple ID and password when prompted. Or, in iTunes, you can choose Account → Authorizations → Authorize This Computer.</p>\n<p class=\"pullQuote\">Trying to understand what these different categories cover, and then trying to manage your devices, can be a head-scratcher.</p>\n<p>You may want to deauthorize one or more of your computers as well; you may have a computer that no longer works, or you may have sold or given away your Mac or PC. If you haven’t deauthorized it before selling or giving it away, or if you find that you’ve reached your limit, then you can deauthorize all of your computers from your iTunes account. Choose Account → View My Account, then, in the Apple ID Summary section, under Computer Authorizations, click Deauthorize All.</p>\n<p>As you can see below, I have five computers authorized. The only problem is, I don’t have five computers authorized. There’s no way to see which computers are listed as authorized, and I only know of four computers that are currently linked to my account. I could deauthorize them all, but Apple only lets you do this once per year. If you shift computers often, or if you have problems with a computer that gets repaired several times (the authorization is based on a unique identifier in your hardware) you may be stuck.</p>\n<p>Understanding associated devices can be complicated too. It’s not clear how different this is than authorizations (at least for computers; associated devices include iOS devices, but not the Apple TV). My computers show up as associated devices, and they’re authorized; I can disassociate devices, once every 90 days, but I don’t understand why a computer needs to be both authorized and associated.</p>\n<p>If I can see which devices are associated with my account, why can’t I see which computers are authorized?</p>\n<p class=\"pullQuote\">Understanding associated devices can be complicated too.</p>\n<p>And why can’t I deauthorize a single computer, especially if I have had one that needed repairs? And why the annual limit?</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0016-0160/438363-1-eng-US/f0016-012.jpg\" width=\"762\" height=\"410\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0016-01\" title=\"f0016-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p>Associated devices include iOS devices, but it’s not entirely clear how different this association is from authorization.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>Apple has made this process confusing, and, though it isn’t a problem for most people, anyone with a couple of kids, a few Macs, and a bunch of iOS devices, will have problems.

After all, who doesn’t like not paying for things? The recent announcement that Apple’s productivity and creative software— namely Pages, Numbers, Keynote, GarageBand, and iMovie—is now free to all users was mainly greeted with a positive reaction from pundits and consumers alike.</p>\n<p>I’ll agree that making these apps (which were already provided no charge to people who bought new Macs, iPhone, and iPads) free across the board is largely a positive move. But that decision does have some consequences that could be a downside for end users, developers, and even Apple.</p>\n<h2><b>NOT-SO-FIERCE COMPETITION</b></h2><p>The effect is probably most pronounced for small and indie developers. Since Apple can afford to fund the development of these apps and then just give them away, it’s a tough proposition for small businesses to invest the time and money into building competing apps. Those developers generally have to charge for their apps, and consumers may wonder why they should pay when they can get Apple’s offerings for free.</p>\n<p>That said, in the case of these particular apps, that ship pretty much sailed long ago. Most Mac and iOS users only ended up paying for an app like Pages or Garage- Band when it was time to upgrade the version. Apple’s essentially been the 800-pound gorilla in these markets since it first started giving away these apps with new devices.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0018-0160/438413-1-eng-US/f0018-012.jpg\" width=\"366\" height=\"366\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0018-01\" title=\"f0018-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>That’s not to say there’s no competition for these apps. On one side you’ve got open-source software (Audacity remains a popular audio editor, for example), while on the other you’ve got similar offerings from other giant companies, like Google Docs, Google Sheets, and Microsoft’s Office 365. So while consumer choice isn’t eliminated, it does certainly make it harder for a new player to enter the market. This might seem like a minor issue, when you have these wealth of choices…except for the niche users.</p>\n<h2><b>YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR</b></h2><p>Here’s the thing: free can be a not-sogreat price to pay. Sure, it feels satisfying, but when it comes to getting that one feature you want, or fixing that annoying bug, the gap between user and customer can feel broad. It’s easier to argue or advocate for a missing or broken feature when you’ve shelled out hard-earned cash for it.</p>\n<p>That can be tough if a piece of software largely, but not completely, meets your needs. For example, take Garage- Band. It’s a remarkably competent audio editor, and I use it for all the podcasts I produce. But a few years ago, Apple removed the app’s podcast-specific editing features, and there are other features that would aid in podcast editing that the company never added in the first place—and there’s a good chance that it never will.</p>\n<p>That makes it tough if you’re looking for that one specific feature that really sells an app for you. Because if Apple isn’t likely to add the feature, and third-party developers can’t compete enough to make money, what are your options left? (Aside from building your own software, which, let’s be honest, is beyond most of our capabilities.)</p>\n<p>And frankly, that’s a problem not just for users, but for Apple too.</p>\n<h2><b>ALL ABOUT THE ECOSYSTEM</b></h2><p>Part of me thinks that Apple would love to incorporate all those niche features in apps that it can provide to all of its users free of charge, but there are always limitations and priorities when it comes to running a business.</p>\n<p>That’s one reason moving those apps to free worries me. iWork, GarageBand, and iMovie are no longer even bringing in a small amount of revenue—instead they’re purely ecosystem plays that help attract people to buy Apple’s hardware. That’s nothing new for Apple: the iTunes Store long operated in a similar fashion, and Apple made its yearly macOS updates free as well.</p>\n<p>But when it comes to productivity apps, the calculus is a little different. Giving these apps away could de-incentivize updates that incorporate new features. After all, if they’re not directly bringing in revenue, how much sense does it make to dedicate valuable resources to developing free apps that aren’t either basic table stakes for the company’s operating systems— Mail, Safari, Messages—or apps that provide a gateway to bringing in more revenue, like iTunes.</p>\n<p class=\"pullQuote\">It’s easier to argue or advocate for a missing or broken feature when you’ve shelled out hard-earned cash for it.</p>\n<h2><b>THE UPSIDE</b></h2><p>Despite all these concerns, I think that, on balance, making these apps free is a good move. That’s because the benefit to end users is mostly positive. Users, for example, won’t be confused about why they suddenly need to pay for updates to these apps they own, when they don’t have to pay for other app updates. (And I’m sure, from Apple’s perspective, it’s preferable to those users simply not updating at all.)</p>\n<p>But the risks are real, even though we may not see some of them truly materialize until down the road.

And, often, you need to make some tweak or change in a PDF or fill it out when it hasn’t been set up by its creator to have preset form elements.</p>\n<p>If you’re working as a design professional, you probably already subscribe to or have access at work to Adobe’s Creative Cloud, which includes Adobe Acrobat pro tools. If not, you likely rely on Apple’s Preview app, which has basic PDF handling, but suffered a series of glitches in Sierra that made it hard to use with PDFs. (Those all seem to be fixed now.)</p>\n<p>But I’ve found in my own work and in correspondence with both design pros and regular users that Acrobat is obscure and hard to master, and Preview typically insufficient.</p>\n<p>It’s into this gap that Smile developed PDFpen (<a href=\"https://smilesoftware.com/pdfpen\" target=\"_self\">$75</a>) and PDFpenPro (<a href=\"https://smilesoftware.com/pdfpenpro\" target=\"_self\">$125</a>), which have matured for many years as an alternative. PDFpenPro is as full featured as Acrobat in nearly every respect and PDFpen just a little less so, while Smile offers each at a standalone price that’s reasonable. It’s much easier to master either app than Acrobat, and Smile has retained a consistent but routinely improved interface for the software over the years, unlike Adobe’s giant shifts in approach for Acrobat that leaves longtime users like me reeling.</p>\n\n<div>\n<table bgcolor=\"#eeeeee\">\n<tr>\n    <td>\n    <h3>PDFPEN 9</h3>\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/3.5mice17/468414-1-eng-US/3.5mice.png\" width=\"271\" height=\"144\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"3.5mice\" title=\"3.5mice\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h4><b>PRICE</b></h4><p>$75</p>\n<h3>PDFPENPRO 9</h3>\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/3.5mice17/468414-1-eng-US/3.5mice.png\" width=\"271\" height=\"144\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"3.5mice\" title=\"3.5mice\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h4><b>PRICE</b></h4><p>$125</p>\n\n    </td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n</div><p>The macOS software is both exhaustively featured and generally intuitive. Both editions can create and edit the contents of PDFs, allow drawing and adding text on top of files, and include excellent optical character recognition (OCR) software. The Pro flavor is also a superb way to design forms, retrofit existing documents to contain form fields, and fill out forms. There’s a slight awkwardness in picking, setting values for, and switching among the app’s several tools, but it’s minor compared to its utility and ease of use once you’re using a tool.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/pdf2/468173-1-eng-US/pdf.jpg\" width=\"1200\" height=\"708\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"pdf\" title=\"pdf\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>Powerful OCR works even with rough original, like this example from 1917.

Version 9 isn’t nearly as big an upgrade, but it’s packed full of enhancements and additions, notably a large variety of image export options and better annotation management, useful when marking up a PDF.</p>\n<p>The Pro version differs from the regular by adding to its features some options that are critical to niche audiences, including Microsoft Excel, Microsoft PowerPoint, and PDF/A output and table of contents and form creation and editing.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0023-0154/438463-1-eng-US/f0023-012.jpg\" width=\"501\" height=\"400\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0023-01\" title=\"f0023-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>Table of contents editing in the Pro version of PDFpen brings it close to Acrobat parity.</b></p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>(In this review, I’ll refer to both apps’ core functionality as PDFpen, calling out features that require PDFpenPro.)</p>\n<h3><b>WHAT’S NEW IN VERSION 9</b></h3><p>For those who already use or know PDFpen, let me jump to the chase about new features in version 9. Smile has focused on improving annotations used to comment on a PDF, export formats and controls, and table of contents support (Pro version only)</p>\n<p>Annotations let you mark up a PDF and share the results without modifying the underlying PDF. It’s one of PDFpen’s strongest features, offering easily accessible, multiple tools for highlighting, adding comments, striking through text, and the like.</p>\n<p>However, in previous versions, it was slightly harder to work with these annotations. Version 9 makes it possible to select multiple annotations at once, copy the text, delete them, and show highlights in the Annotations sidebar view. You can also choose to print just annotations, making it easier to review comments separately from the document as another PDF or in print form.</p>\n<p>For those who require a table of contents (TOC) or need to work with one created elsewhere, Acrobat has been your best choice until now. PDFpenPro allows substantially more advanced TOC options for more sophisticated and less clunky interaction. It also now merges TOC entries when combining files.</p>\n<p>While Preview and Acrobat have had relatively robust ways to export pages from PDF into other formats, it’s one area that PDFpen has lagged in. This latest version does a bit more, adding a host of image formats and options that include 1-bit TIFF (black-and-white), grayscale export, and JPEG and PNG files. It also allows a range of image resolution (really density measured in dots per inch) in making the conversion.</p>\n<p>Most of the remaining version 9 changes are fiddly things everyone will appreciate (like showing resizing handles for items that are off the edge of the page), or for which people with specific needs will suddenly breathe a sigh of relief (such as horizontal OCR for ideographic languages, like Chinese, in PDFpenPro).</p>\n<p class=\"pullQuote\">While Preview and Acrobat have had relatively robust ways to export pages from PDF into other formats, it’s one area that PDFpen has lagged in.</p>\n<h3><b>THE REST OF PDFPEN</b></h3><p>PDFpen has seemingly nearly as many features and options as Adobe Acrobat, but I consistently find myself able to figure out how to accomplish what I want in PDFpen, while I often have to consult web documentation and poke around in Acrobat to get to where I’m going. That’s partly because Smile chose to use a straightforward toolbar (introduced a few versions back) mirrored in a Tools menu to spell it all out.</p>\n<p>Like Acrobat, PDFpen is a rich PDF editor, letting you work with text, images, attachments, and annotations, and edit anything that appears on a page, including all of those elements. You can also delete objects, or redact parts of a document— this is true redaction, where the underlying data is removed, rather than just a black bar being overlaid. This toolset is also useful when you’re given a PDF, instead of generating it yourself, or when you’re working through revisions on a document that you’re handing back and forth among a team.</p>\n<p>You can select text to copy it out, or use a Correct Text feature to edit it. PDFpen’s one drawback relative to Acrobat is how it handles dropping in revised text. Acrobat can read embedded fonts, even ones that are subsetted (including only the characters used in the document), and your “touch-ups” appear in the native font whenever possible. This preserves the appearance. PDFpen drops in a default font, which makes it impossible to use to make an aesthetically usable seamless fix. You can adjust this by selecting fonts installed in OS X, but it’s not nearly as useful. In one document I tested, PDFpen splayed the edited text all over the page in different fonts; Acrobat handled editing the same text just fine.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0025-0151/438456-1-eng-US/f0025-012.jpg\" width=\"534\" height=\"298\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0025-01\" title=\"f0025-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>One rough spot in PDFpen is its difficulty in allowing “touch-up” editing in the same font, which lead in this example to a type explosion of sorts.</b></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>Both versions let you fill out form fields created in other software. If you need to make your own forms, the Pro versions can autogenerate form fields, or you can drop them in manually and format their appearance. Autogeneration is quite amazing: I threw scanned images—not just PDFs—at PDFpenPro that had continuous lines with labels underneath for first, middle, and last name, and other similar entries, and it correctly broke those into separate fields. Pro can even embed a button into a PDF that allows someone filling it out to submit the form data or the filled-out PDF to a Web server or send either via email.</p>\n<p>I regularly use PDFpen to convert the text of scanned documents or images using its built-in OCR engine from OmniPage. The software prompts you when you open a document that has images that could be analyzed, although you can disable that prompt. (Here’s a tip: The Edit → OCR option is often dimmed when the app doesn’t think there’s text to recognize; hold down Command and Option and select the Edit menu, and you can force OCR.)</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0026-0162/438449-1-eng-US/f0026-012.jpg\" width=\"762\" height=\"542\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0026-01\" title=\"f0026-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>PDFpenPro recognizes complex field arrangements when automatically creating fill-in forms.</b></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>The OCR software is highly accurate, even for extremely degraded text. I tried it on old newspaper pages with very small type, and it did remarkably well. On typewritten or computer output, it’s nearly perfect in my testing. Once converted, you can search on the document or display the text in an isolated layer. The Pro version lets you correct the text, too.</p>\n<p>Version 8 added digital signatures, verifying cryptographically that a document is unchanged since the creator locked it. PDFpen shows that a PDF is signed by displaying a triangular notch in the upper right corner. If the triangle is green and has a checkmark, the app has verified it; clicking the corner brings up additional technical details.</p>\n<p>I found it wonky to sign in PDFpen in version 8, and it remains so in version 9. You have to select Tools → Signature Field, click on a document, draw a signature (or at least click in a drawing field), and then click Apply Digital Signature, at which point you can select an existing certificate or generate a self-signed one.</p>\n<p>PDFpen can make use of measurement, a feature that’s part of the PDF spec, but is typically incorporated only when architectural and other computer-aided design (CAD) software exports a PDF. With a PDF that embeds scale and units, the measuring tool displays those accordingly. But you can also use it with any PDF, where PDFpen uses the document’s explicit measurements (like 8.5 by 11 inches) as the basis of dimensions that you can opt to show in points, inches, or millimeters. The measurements can only be made one at a time, can’t be stored, and can’t be edited—only dragged from a starting to ending place, making them somewhat less useful than they could be.</p>\n<p class=\"pullQuote\">PDFs can support file attachments and annotations, and PDFpen lets a PDF act as a kind of portmanteau or a sticky-note festooned marked-up copy.</p>\n<p>PDFs can support file attachments and annotations, and PDFpen lets a PDF act as a kind of portmanteau or a sticky-note festooned marked-up copy. PDFpen can extract file attachments and annotations, and also preview them. The basic PDFpen is more of a viewer while the Pro edition can add and delete attachments and annotations. Both versions also let you record audio annotations you can add to a PDF as well as play them back.</p>\n<p>Version 8 added local export of text and graphics as a Word file (both versions) or Excel (Pro only), where previous releases sent the PDF to Smile’s servers for processing. I exported a complicated PDF that included a very detailed table and the resulting version in Word was almost pixel perfect and fully editable. The same PDF exported to Excel in the Pro release with equally well-preserved tabular detail, including merging and spanning cells. Even a PDF with little tabular data and images exported to Excel just fine.</p>\n<h3><b>CRASHING BUGS</b></h3><p>Unfortunately, during my testing of the 9.0.1 release, I experienced several crashes when performing routine tasks, some of which were “destructive,” losing changes I had made since the previous save. This happened while trying to choose annotation options in the Print dialog, while printing annotations, and while adding a digital signature field to a page.</p>\n<p>Some of the crashes seemed to occur on one pass, but after relaunching and attempting the same task, it worked without a hitch. I expect that Smile will fix whatever bugs have led to these crashes, of course, and I’ve reported them all to the company.</p>\n<p class=\"pullQuote\">Some of the crashes seemed to occur on one pass, but after relaunching and attempting the same task, it worked without a hitch.</p>\n<p>However, more generally, my expectation with software in 2017 that manipulates documents is that they will use some form of journaling or continuous save, much as we see in Pages, BBEdit, InDesign, and other business and professional software. With those apps, even a system crash often loses no more than the last keystroke after launching the app, as it can recover the intermediate changes.</p>\n<p>This reduces my score for the app overall, and it’s an area I hope Smile puts effort into in the future, given the broad support for intermediate continuous saving in other apps.</p>\n<h3><b>PRICING</b></h3><p>Smile sells single-user licenses for $75 and $125 for the regular and Pro versions, respectively, whether directly through the company site or through the Mac App Store. The Mac App Store doesn’t support upgrades or family and multi-user business licenses, which can be purchased directly.</p>\n<p>Smile charges $30 for upgrades to either version, and $50 to move from PDFpen to PDFpenPro 9.

If you frequently convert scanned documents into editable text files, it’s hands-down the fastest way to get the job done.</p>\n<p>Version 16 introduces an all-new user interface that makes the software easier to use, thanks to a toolbar with convenient one-click conversion options across the top and tools to analyze, adjust, and preview consolidated along the right edge of the window.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0030-0168/438541-1-eng-US/f0030-012.jpg\" width=\"760\" height=\"490\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0030-01\" title=\"f0030-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>Thanks to automatic processing, Readiris Pro 16 users can scan, convert, and save documents in a single step.</b></p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>Core functionality remains the same.

In almost all cases, Readiris displayed recognition results in the blink of an eye, seemingly before the entire sheet of paper would be completely ejected from the scanner’s document feeder. However, Abbyy FineReader often produced more-accurate results, especially on documents of lower quality.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0032-0164/438520-1-eng-US/f0032-012.jpg\" width=\"585\" height=\"445\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0032-01\" title=\"f0032-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>OCR documents straight to your favorite cloud services, thanks to Readiris Pro 16’s built-in support.</b></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>I do prefer Abbyy’s iLife-style user interface, although both applications are easy to navigate. One-click export options for PDF, Word, and Excel do give Readiris 16 the upper hand, and users who frequently save to the same format and location can streamline things even further with automatic processing, which goes directly from scanning to saving within seconds. Readiris also offers built-in support for saving directly to cloud services Evernote, Dropbox, OneDrive, and Box, which Abbyy does not.</p>\n<p>One thing both OCR applications do equally well is attempt to preserve the layout of the original document. While neither ever quite accomplish 100 percent accuracy, Readiris provides a better set of tools for editing recognized content, which can be assigned as text, graphics, table, or barcode zones. Despite the pro moniker, extended PDF tools like digital signatures and batch document conversion are only available in the $199 Corporate version.</p>\n<h3><b>BOTTOM LINE</b></h3><p>When it comes to sheer conversion speed and file-saving versatility, Readiris Pro 16 beats the clock for converting scanned documents into editable text, although it tends to produce slightly less accurate results than Abbyy FineReader.</p>\n","layout":{"landscape":{"id":"am-landscape-17","link":"macuser_review_02-l.twig"},"portrait":{"id":"am-portrait-17","link":"macuser_review_02.twig"}},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":0,"link_source":"","competition":[],"flatplan_title":"","notes":"","gutter_credit":"","other":"","image":[{"id":"c2daf4802df24c5a6c941cf406f9c03c","name":"readiris","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/readiris2/468180-1-eng-US/readiris.jpg?t=story_img_size_768x0&ext/readiris_story_img_size_768x0.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"775","height":"467","legacy_id":"31551","is_default":true},{"id":"c2daf4802df24c5a6c941cf406f9c03c","name":"readiris","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/readiris2/468180-1-eng-US/readiris.jpg?t=story_img_size_768x0&ext/readiris_story_img_size_768x0.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"775","height":"467","legacy_id":"31551","is_default":false}],"related_objects":{"image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_4_1495463789.3595","name":"f0032-01","source":"","caption":"<p><b>OCR

but damn, is it small (approximately 2.5 x 1 x 1 inches) and it punches well above its weight.</p>\n<p>As its name implies, the Dart-C is a USB-C Power Delivery (PD) charger, so it’s compatible with most devices that use the reversible USB-C port. A second USB Type A charging port is integrated into the cable. The placement of the second port looks clumsy but fortunately doesn’t add much to the overall weight. There’s also a small LED that glows when the brick is powered up so you know you didn’t forget to plug it in.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0034-0168/438633-1-eng-US/f0034-012.jpg\" width=\"763\" height=\"406\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0034-01\" title=\"f0034-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>The Dart-C (right) will output 65 watts of power, which is 4 watts more than the larger and heavier Apple MacBook Pro 13 charger (left).</b></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>TINY, SEXY, AND POWERFUL</b></h3><p>Despite it being really not much larger than a cell phone charger, the Dart-C is rated at 65 watts of output, which can power most 13-inch, and smaller, laptops (and even some 15-inch laptops).</p>\n<p>FINsix says a very high-frequency power technology helps make the Dart-C so small. That comes with a cost, though: With a retail price of $100, it’s even pricier than Apple’s power bricks, which themselves carry a premium.</p>\n\n<div>\n<table bgcolor=\"#eeeeee\">\n<tr>\n    <td>\n    <h3>FINSIX DART-C</h3>\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/4.5mice21/468496-1-eng-US/4.5mice.png\" width=\"345\" height=\"144\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"4.5mice\" title=\"4.5mice\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h4><b>PROS</b></h4><p>• Almost as small as a cell phone charger</p>\n<p>• Can put out 60 watts of power</p>\n<h4><b>CONS</b></h4><p>• Expensive charger</p>\n<p>• Doesn’t work with Google Chromebook Pixel, and HP Spectre x360 has issues</p>\n<h4><b>PRICE</b></h4><p>$100</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n    </td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n</div><p>FINsix says the higher cost is offset by the fact that Apple’s power brick is bigger and heavier by comparison and doesn’t actually come with a USB-C cable. That means you have to pay $69 for the 61-watt brick and then another $19 for the USB-C cable. PC chargers are generally cheaper than that, but not always by much. The best price I could find for a replacement Asus Zenbook 3 charger was $70. HP and Dell’s chargers push $60, if you can even find them in stock.</p>\n<p>While some PC chargers come close to the weight of the Dart-C, the typical wall wart puts out a lot less power and is much bulkier.</p>\n<h3><b>HOW WE TESTED</b></h3><p>Because USB-C Power Delivery hasn’t exactly had a <a href=\"http://go.macworld.com/badusbc\" target=\"_self\">smooth launch</a>, I wanted to see just how many laptops the Dart-C would actually work with. I gathered up seven different laptops (the same ones used in my previous USB-C charging <a href=\"http://go.macworld.com/usbcchar\" target=\"_self\">showdown</a>) from Apple, Google, Lenovo, Acer, HP, Asus, and Dell—companies that represent 80 percent of the notebook market. I added a couple of USB-C phones: the Huaweimade Nexus 6P and Google Pixel XL. I used a Satechi USB-C power meter to measure the charge rates on each device.</p>\n<h3><b>COMPATIBILITY PROBLEMS</b></h3><p>While I had no issues with most of the laptops I tested, two coughed up furballs. The first was the HP Spectre x360 13t. HP plays it super-safe, issuing a risk warning when a non-HP charger is being used, but it doesn’t prevent the Dart-C from doing its job. I also discovered that when the Dart-C was plugged into the laptop but not the wall, HP’s laptop would slow to a crawl. A BIOS update did not change the behavior, which I also duplicated multiple times on a second Spectre laptop. But when the Dart-C was tethered to a power outlet, the laptop charged up as normal. Is this a deal-breaker? Probably not. It’s quite evident when the performance slows down, and simply plugging the cord into an outlet or unplugging the Dart-C from the laptop returns the Spectre’s performance to normal.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0035-0147/438619-1-eng-US/f0035-012.jpg\" width=\"761\" height=\"399\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0035-01\" title=\"f0035-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>The Dart-C features a proprietary cable with an inline USB Type A port that can output 2 amps.</b></p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div>\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0036-0166/438612-1-eng-US/f0036-012.jpg\" width=\"763\" height=\"574\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0036-01\" title=\"f0036-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>We measured output using a USB-C power meter.</b></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>CHROMEBOOK PIXEL OWNERS: DON’T BUY THIS CHARGER</b></h3><p>We encountered more severe problems with Google’s Chromebook Pixel.</p>\n<p>The Dart-C simply would not charge the Pixel if I plugged the charger in when the Chromebook was booted into the OS. Even worse, the Dart-C subsequently failed to work with any of the other laptops it had previously worked with. Initially I thought the charger had died.</p>\n<p>It wasn’t until I unplugged the cable from the charger’s body and then plugged it back in that the charger was revived. I could reproduce the “dying” repeatedly, and a second review unit from FINsix exhibited the same issue.</p>\n<p>Even more confusing, I found that plugging the Dart-C into the Google Chromebook Pixel while it was sleeping and then waking it would work, but unplugging it and plugging it back into the Pixel while active would “brick” the unit.</p>\n<p>FINsix told <i>PCWorld</i> that the problem seems to be rooted in how the Pixel handles a particular USB Power Delivery function: “We have found that the system will charge normally if the charger is connected while the device is sleeping (and continues normally when it’s awakened so long as the charger is not disconnected). This is related to detailed signal timing of a particular function supported by USB-PD, called try.SRC. When the Pixel is under sleep mode, it does not initiate try.SRC, therefore no timing issues arise and the Dart-C and Pixel are able to negotiate and charge without any issues. The Pixel phone, Pixel XL, and Pixel C tablet do not implement try.SRC, and the Dart-C is compatible with them as a result.”</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0037-0158/438605-1-eng-US/f0037-012.jpg\" width=\"763\" height=\"482\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0037-01\" title=\"f0037-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>FINsix’s Dart-C charger on top of a Nexus 6P.</b></p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>After our review ran, FINsix said it had been in communication with Google about the problem and had decided to address the try.SRC issue in an updated cable that will ship with all Dart-C chargers going forward. We’ve asked for the new cable to retest the Pixel Chromebook’s support and will post any updates on <a href=\"http://PCWorld.com\" target=\"_self\">PCWorld.com</a>.</p>\n<h3><b>USB POWER DELIVERY KEEPS CHANGING THE RULES</b></h3><p>The good news is that my issues with the Spectre and Pixel didn’t surface anywhere else. In the chart below you’ll see that, for the most part, charge rates were as expected. Despite the two hiccups (with the HP’s being fairly minor), the Dart excelled in voltage support.</p>\n<p>USB Power Delivery, or USB-PD, has been a TMZ-worthy messy affair, with ever-shifting “profiles,” and now “rules,” changing every few months. As we understand it, the new rules require that USB-PD chargers support 20 volts, 15 volts, 9 volts, and 5 volts. Any lower voltage “rails” below the high one must support a minimum of 3 amps. Additional voltage rails, such as 12 volts, are now optional.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0038-0167/438598-1-eng-US/f0038-012.jpg\" width=\"764\" height=\"576\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0038-01\" title=\"f0038-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>FINsix’s Dart-C isn’t perfect (yellow squares indicate minor issues; red indicate major ones) but its size, weight, and power output make it worth consideration.</b></p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div>\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0039-0151/438591-1-eng-US/f0039-012.jpg\" width=\"975\" height=\"584\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0039-01\" title=\"f0039-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>We ran the Dart-C above its rated 65 watts by also putting a 2-amp load on the USB Type A charger, while charging a MacBook Pro 15 with the screen on max and a game running in the background.</b></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>In the Voltage Supported column in the chart, you can see that few of the OEM chargers support the latest rules. To get a “better” charger, you basically want one that supports more varied voltage rails with a minimum of 3 amps. The vast majority of them simply don’t support all the needed rails nor put out enough power to charge higher-demand devices such as phones or tablets properly.</p>\n<p>For example, Google’s Pixel XL, which can fast-charge at up to 18 watts, would be underserved by the chargers here that fall below 11 watts. Those laptop chargers, which can reach 45 watts or higher on a laptop, would charge the Pixel XL at a far slower rate than the wall wart that comes with it would. The Dart-C? It had no problems charging the Pixel XL at just about its maximum of 17 watts. In fact, of all of the chargers in the chart, only the HP and Dart-C seem to support the current USB-PD Rules.</p>\n<h3><b>IT DOES GET HOT</b></h3><p>One concern people have about tiny power bricks is the heat they generate. To test that with a worst-case scenario, I plugged the Dart-C into a MacBook Pro 15, set the screen to its maximum brightness, and then cranked up a game on the GPU to consume even more power. To make things even more challenging, I added a controlled 2-amp load to the USB Type A port on the Dart-C.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0040-0166/438584-1-eng-US/f0040-012.jpg\" width=\"763\" height=\"439\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0040-01\" title=\"f0040-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>The MacBook Pro 13 features a USB Type C port, while the Dart-C features a proprietary plug.

Most USB Type C PD laptops we’ve tested will run just fine on undersized power bricks. The only negative would be slower charge rates, or possibly a failure to charge at all if the brick puts out less power than you are simultaneously consuming with the laptop. (Note to MBP 15 owners, this doesn’t work in all cases, as the laptop won’t charge from, say, an HP charger.)</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0041-0154/438577-1-eng-US/f0041-012.jpg\" width=\"607\" height=\"456\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0041-01\" title=\"f0041-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>This thermal image shows just how toasty the Dart-C can get when pushed really, really hard.</b></p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>Running the Dart-C at 75 watts (which is above its stated 65 watt rating) for an hour, I measured parts of the brick hitting 159 degrees Fahrenheit. That’s pretty toasty, but not enough to hurt you. Plenty of power bricks I’ve used before get nearly as hot. Under a more normal load of about 38 watts, the body was warm but a far more tolerable 122 degrees Fahrenheit. The good news is I didn’t note any power drop-off, even while heated up.</p>\n<h3><b>CONCLUSION</b></h3><p>Clearly the functionality is there. The question is—is it worth it? As a replacement for a lost OEM charger, or even a secondary unit, the answer is yes. The minimal weight and bulk of the Dart-C is truly liberating. It’s so light, I’d slip it into my bag just to charge my Nexus 6P. And if I needed to carry a laptop around, such as the HP Spectre x360 13t, I’d know I already had a charger with me.</p>\n<p>Carrying the Dart-C is just so easy, while just about every OEM laptop brick is a burden. That it can also put out 65 watts and support a wide range of voltages is just icing. (Note: For those who own the previous universal version of the Dart, FINsix offers a <a href=\"http://go.macworld.com/finsixcbl\" target=\"_self\">USB Type C cable</a> for $35.99, that lets you convert your older Dart for USB-C use.)</p>\n","layout":{"landscape":{"id":"am-landscape-17","link":"macuser_review_02-l.twig"},"portrait":{"id":"am-portrait-17","link":"macuser_review_02.twig"}},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":0,"link_source":"","competition":[],"flatplan_title":"","notes":"","gutter_credit":"","other":"","image":[{"id":"b622d099a5919ae23b3d8287a61e5554","name":"finsen","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/finsen3/468187-1-eng-US/finsen.jpg?t=story_img_size_768x0&ext/finsen_story_img_size_768x0.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"1272","height":"844","legacy_id":"31552","is_default":true},{"id":"b622d099a5919ae23b3d8287a61e5554","name":"finsen","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/finsen3/468187-1-eng-US/finsen.jpg?t=story_img_size_768x0&ext/finsen_story_img_size_768x0.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"1272","height":"844","legacy_id":"31552","is_default":false}],"related_objects":{"image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_9_1495463793.2318","name":"f0041-01","source":"","caption":"<p><b>This thermal image shows just how toasty the Dart-C can get when pushed really, really hard.</b></p>\n","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0041-0154/438577-1-eng-US/f0041-012.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"607","height":"456","legacy_id":"29270"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_9_1495463793.2318","name":"f0041-01","source":"","caption":"<p><b>This thermal image shows just how toasty the Dart-C can get when pushed really, really hard.</b></p>\n","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0041-0154/438577-1-eng-US/f0041-012.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"607","height":"456","legacy_id":"29270"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_8_1495463793.9098","name":"f0040-01","source":"","caption":"<p><b>The MacBook Pro 13 features a USB Type C port, while the Dart-C features a proprietary plug.

It’s fast, too, with a 20-page auto document feeder for scanning color, grayscale, or black-and-white sheets up to 44 inches long at 25 pages per minute using the most common 300 dpi setting.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0043-0149/438683-1-eng-US/f0043-012.jpg\" width=\"366\" height=\"312\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0043-01\" title=\"f0043-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>The top of the Epson DS-320 flips open to reveal the input tray, complete with an optional V-shaped paper guide for longer pages.</b></p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>The DS-320 also scans both sides of a page in a single pass (better known as duplex mode) while consuming a modest 8W of power while in use. The latter is important, because it allows the DS-320 to be used without AC power from a single USB 3.0 connection to a MacBook or PC. (A USB cable and AC adapter are included in the box.)</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, Epson has somewhat hindered the portability of this model. Unlike cheaper models in Epson’s lineup, the DS-320 has no wireless connectivity of any kind. There’s also no internal battery, so this won’t replace the likes of Fujitsu’s <a href=\"http://go.macworld.com/ix100\" target=\"_self\">ScanSnap iX100</a> ($229; available <a href=\"http://go.macworld.com/ix100amz\" target=\"_self\">on Amazon</a>) for those who prefer scanning to a smartphone or tablet. For that, look to Epson’s <a href=\"http://go.macworld.com/ix100amz\" target=\"_self\">ES-300W</a> ($299; $250 <a href=\"http://go.macworld.com/ix100amz\" target=\"_self\">on Amazon</a>), a slightly thicker model with nearly matching specs at the same retail price, along with the ability to scan wirelessly.</p>\n\n<div>\n<table bgcolor=\"#eeeeee\">\n<tr>\n    <td>\n    <h3>EPSON DS-320 MOBILE SCANNER</h3>\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/3.5mice19/468503-1-eng-US/3.5mice.png\" width=\"271\" height=\"144\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"3.5mice\" title=\"3.5mice\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h4><b>PROS</b></h4><p>• Compact, lightweight portable document scanner</p>\n<p>• Auto document feeder holds up to 20 pages</p>\n<p>• Powered by single USB cable connected to Mac or PC</p>\n<h4><b>CONS</b></h4><p>• No wireless or mobile scanning capability</p>\n<p>• Flimsy adjustable page guides</p>\n<p>• Same cost as Epson’s equivalent wireless scanner</p>\n<h4><b>PRICE</b></h4><p>$250</p>\n\n    </td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n</div><h3><b>QUALITY SCANNING</b></h3><p>Although slightly larger, heavier, and more expensive than Fujitsu’s popular wireless competitor, the DS-320 works more like a traditional desktop scanner. The latch on the front allows the top of the unit to open revealing the input tray, which extends upward into a V-shaped paper guide to comfortably support longer pages.</p>\n<p>The flimsy adjustable plastic edge guides are the only potential downside to the hardware. When stored, they lie flat against the input tray, flipping into position when you press on the small tabs; often they just get in the way. There’s also a card slot on the front, enabled by sliding the mode selector to the left and inserting cards face up, but in my tests, my scans frequently wound up crooked.</p>\n<p>Scan quality is quite good, exceeding that of both all-in-one Epson models in my home office and on a par with the ScanSnap iX500. I was impressed with scans of artwork and graphic-rich documents, but the results were less fabulous with color photo prints. Epson bundles a full complement of software with the DS-320, including the company’s own quite capable Document Capture and the cumbersome Epson Scan. The hardware is TWAIN and ISIS compliant, making it compatible with a wide range of software.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n

This adapter doesn’t just offer any old flavor of Wi-Fi. Rather, it’s the very hippest and latest thing: it uses 802.11ac Wave 2 with MU-MIMO, which can increase throughput and help with network capacity. (Yes, those terms require some unpacking, but trust us—it’s great.) Edimax also includes beamforming, which lets an adapter and router focus more of their transmitting signal energy at each, producing a stronger (and thus often faster) connection. <b>—GLENN FLEISHMAN</b></p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0047-0140/438719-1-eng-US/f0047-012.jpg\" width=\"762\" height=\"591\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0047-01\" title=\"f0047-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n <span class=\"credit\">\nIMAGE: AUKEY</span></figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3>AUKEY MULTIPORT USB-C HUB</h3><p>The $100 <a href=\"https://aukey.com\" target=\"_self\">Aukey</a> Multiport USB-C Hub brings VGA to a robust compact dock solution. It comes with a seemingly hefty price tag, but by offering a choice between HDMI and VGA while incorporating passthrough power and several other ports, the Aukey unit offers the greatest flexibility for the road-warrior presenter. You’ll still need a DVI to HDMI adapter, but that’s it. It has a brushed aluminum case and easy access to the whopping six ports on its compact frame. In addition to 4K at 30Hz HDMI support and 1080p over VGA (with capable monitors), it also includes passthrough USB-C power (no USB-C data), two USB 3.1 (5 Gbps) Type-A jacks, and gigabit Ethernet. All of these options make it an easy recommendation.<b>— GLENN FLEISHMAN</b></p>\n","layout":{"landscape":{"id":"am-landscape-15","link":"macuser_hotstuff-l.twig"},"portrait":{"id":"am-portrait-15","link":"macuser_hotstuff.twig"}},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":0,"link_source":"","competition":[],"flatplan_title":"","notes":"","gutter_credit":"","other":"","image":[{"id":"c5027dbbf2d242b383b287254dacb20b","name":"se","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/se2/468201-1-eng-US/se.jpg?t=story_img_size_768x0&ext/se_story_img_size_768x0.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"2734","height":"2051","legacy_id":"31554","is_default":true},{"id":"c5027dbbf2d242b383b287254dacb20b","name":"se","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/se2/468201-1-eng-US/se.jpg?t=story_img_size_768x0&ext/se_story_img_size_768x0.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"2734","height":"2051","legacy_id":"31554","is_default":false}],"related_objects":{"image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_2_1495463804.4845","name":"f0047-01","source":"IMAGE: AUKEY","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0047-0140/438719-1-eng-US/f0047-012.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"762","height":"591","legacy_id":"29288"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_2_1495463804.4845","name":"f0047-01","source":"IMAGE: AUKEY","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0047-0140/438719-1-eng-US/f0047-012.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"762","height":"591","legacy_id":"29288"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_1_1495463805.1701","name":"f0046-01","source":"IMAGE: EDIMAX","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0046-0164/438726-1-eng-US/f0046-012.jpg?t=story_img_size_768x0&ext/f0046-012_story_img_size_768x0.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"763","height":"788","legacy_id":"29289"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_1_1495463805.1701","name":"f0046-01","source":"IMAGE: EDIMAX","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0046-0164/438726-1-eng-US/f0046-012.jpg?t=story_img_size_768x0&ext/f0046-012_story_img_size_768x0.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"763","height":"788","legacy_id":"29289"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1495463805.8233","name":"f0045-01","source":"IMAGE: ELAGO","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0045-0151/438733-1-eng-US/f0045-012.jpg?t=story_img_size_768x0&ext/f0045-012_story_img_size_768x0.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"975","height":"736","legacy_id":"29290"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1495463805.8233","name":"f0045-01","source":"IMAGE: ELAGO","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0045-0151/438733-1-eng-US/f0045-012.jpg?t=story_img_size_768x0&ext/f0045-012_story_img_size_768x0.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"975","height":"736","legacy_id":"29290"},{"id":"344164f723186aef6d9e67532a0e9c3d","name":"edimax","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/edimax2/468208-1-eng-US/edimax.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"851","height":"638","legacy_id":"31555"},{"id":"344164f723186aef6d9e67532a0e9c3d","name":"edimax","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/edimax2/468208-1-eng-US/edimax.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"851","height":"638","legacy_id":"31555"}]},"url_alias":"http://macworld-us.audiencemedia.com","type":"story","order":"8","folio_number":"45","folio_numbers":"45,46,47","pdf_page_index":"45","thumbnail":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/se2/468201-1-eng-US/se.jpg?t=tablet_story_thumbnail&ext/se_tablet_story_thumbnail.jpg","color":"2699cd","real_id":"29287","main_section_id":"1445","ads":[]}],"type":null,"ads":[]}}
