The accessories we describe aren’t necessarily limited to iPhone 7 Plus—in fact, we tested with an iPhone 7. But still, we highly recommend Apple’s latest and largest smartphone if you want the best iPhone camera experience around.</p>\n<h3><b>MOMENT LENS SYSTEM</b></h3><p>In digital videography, your lens has a dramatic effect on how well your camera’s sensor “sees” the image you’re trying to capture. The lens on the iPhone 7 Plus camera isn’t <i>bad</i>, but it is forced into a compromised middle <a href=\"http://go.macworld.com/iphn7dzm\" target=\"_self\">ground</a> between wide and telephoto that’s not ideal for some situations. And you won’t want to use the phone’s digital zoom, which will almost always introduce digital artifacting. Enter the Moment lens system (various models are available at <a href=\"http://go.macworld.com/mmntamz\" target=\"_self\">Amazon</a>, or the <a href=\"https://shopmoment.com\" target=\"_self\">Moment store</a>, for $80—make sure you pick the right one).</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                    <a href=http://www.macworld.com/video/77236/shoot-better-iphone-video-with-handy-tools-and-a-better-app target=\"_self\">        <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/iphonevideo2/468662-1-eng-US/iphonevideo.png\" width=\"853\" height=\"633\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"iPhoneVideo\" title=\"iPhoneVideo\" />\n        </a>\t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>The Moment system begins with a bracket that sticks to the phone itself, giving you the ability to quickly swap between telephoto, wide, and fish-eye lenses. We found that the lenses screw securely into the bracket, and don’t cause any cropping or vignetting on the image. Plus, color reproduction is good. They also have a macro lens, but we found the focus distance is too close to be very useful.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0085-0163/439287-1-eng-US/f0085-012.jpg\" width=\"330\" height=\"209\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0085-01\" title=\"f0085-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n <span class=\"credit\">\nImage: Reticam / Amazon</span></figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>RETICAM SMARTPHONE MOUNT</b></h3><p>Hardware that keeps your video image stable can be a huge upgrade.

For the entry-level auteur, we suggest the <a href=\"http://go.macworld.com/rtcm\" target=\"_self\">Reticam Smartphone Tripod Mount</a>, which costs $25 at <a href=\"http://go.macworld.com/rtcmamz\" target=\"_self\">Amazon</a>.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0085-0234/439280-1-eng-US/f0085-022.jpg\" width=\"763\" height=\"509\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0085-02\" title=\"f0085-02\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p>RetiCam Smartphone Tripod Mount, $25.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>While it may look similar to the smartphone mount you might find on the dash of your car, this mount has a threaded hole in the base, letting you screw the mount onto a tripod or handgrip, giving you a significant boost to your video quality.

The Osmo Mobile is a powered gimbal that uses internal motors to counteract motion while shooting, giving you a degree of stabilization on a par with professional rigs.</p>\n<p>The Osmo Mobile also has other bells and whistles, like shutter and camera controls on the handle. All of our testing yielded stunning results (seriously, check out the video link on the first page to see what it can do). This gimbal only reached its limit at full-on sprinting, where it wasn’t quite able to stabilize all the impact of every foot step.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0087-0163/439266-1-eng-US/f0087-012.jpg\" width=\"487\" height=\"345\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0087-01\" title=\"f0087-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>EDELKRONE POCKETSKATER 2</b></h3><p>The smooth dolly shot is a hallmark of professional video production, and the <a href=\"http://go.macworld.com/edlkrn\" target=\"_self\">Edelkrone PocketSkater 2</a> ($280 at Edelkrone) helps you get that Hollywood-quality effect. And unlike the Osmo Mobile, it doesn’t require power, so you don’t need to worry about batteries or charging. You simply roll it by hand to move your iPhone’s camera in a smooth, level, controlled movement.</p>\n<p>That said, the PocketSkater 2 is intended for use on a flat surface, so your results may vary depending on how smooth of a surface you’re using it on. Also, the dolly is scaled for a smartphone, so you’ll also need to find a surface that’s at the right height to get you the shot you want.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0087-0219/439259-1-eng-US/f0087-022.jpg\" width=\"764\" height=\"509\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0087-02\" title=\"f0087-02\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p>Edelkrone PocketSkater 2, $280.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>But there’s some really nice flexibility here: The wheels on the PocketSkater 2 can be adjusted to achieve both a straight dolly from side to side, and a curving shot that can circle around a subject. Turning the camera 90 degrees on the mount allows you to do dollies in and out. It’s important enough to repeat, though, that you’re always at the mercy of the surface you’re rolling on. It needs to be flat, and at the right height.</p>\n<h3><b>ZOMEI 37MM CLIP-ON NEUTRAL DENSITY LENS</b></h3><p>A neutral density, or ND, filter cuts down the amount of light that reaches the lens. It’s a core tool for professional videographers (and photographers), because it allows you to control exposure once your frame rate and shutter speed are set. A “variable ND,” like the Zomei model we used in the video ($17 on <a href=\"http://go.macworld.com/zomeiamz\" target=\"_self\">Amazon</a>) lets you adjust the strength of the filter up and down by twisting it left or right.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0088-0165/439252-1-eng-US/f0088-012.jpg\" width=\"764\" height=\"490\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0088-01\" title=\"f0088-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p>ZOMEi Universal Adjustable Neutral Density Filter Lens / Clip-on Filter, $17.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>Since it’s adjustable, you’ll be saved the hassle of carrying a bag with various different-strengthed filters wherever you go. Instead, just clip on your variable ND, and you’re ready to shoot. Just note, however, that this Zomei filter is designed to clip directly onto your phone, and won’t fit on an attached lens like the Moment lenses.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0089-0148/439245-1-eng-US/f0089-012.jpg\" width=\"764\" height=\"493\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0089-01\" title=\"f0089-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p>Filmic Pro retails for $15.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>FILMIC PRO</b></h3><p>For all its upsides, the iPhone’s built-in Camera app still lacks manual controls. So, if you want to set exposure, frame rate, shutter speed, and ISO yourself, you’ll need to download a third-party app. And we think the best you can get right now is <a href=\"https://filmicpro.com\" target=\"_self\">Filmic Pro</a>—$15 in the <a href=\"http://go.macworld.com/flmprapp\" target=\"_self\">App Store</a>.</p>\n<p>In addition to controls for the settings mentioned, Filmic Pro allows you to capture video at a higher bit rate than the stock iPhone camera app. This means there will be less compression and less loss of image and color quality in your video.</p>\n<p>Recently, the developer added a $10 in-app purchase for a “cinematographer kit,” which adds log and flat color profiles to help you maximize the camera’s dynamic range. This add-on also includes monitoring tools like focus peaking, false color, and a waveform. One note of caution: Log does add additional noise in certain situations. An advanced user might enjoy access to all these features, but most people will be fine without them.</p>\n<p>You don’t need to spend a lot of money to improve your iPhone video game, but the products we’ve highlighted here can help. And if you don’t want to spend any money, you can still improve your video by avoiding the cardinal sin of smartphone video. Spielberg doesn’t shoot his movies in vertical mode and neither should you.</p>\n","layout":{"landscape":{"id":"am-landscape-29","link":"feature_03-l.twig"},"portrait":{"id":"am-portrait-29","link":"feature_03.twig"}},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":0,"link_source":"","competition":[],"flatplan_title":"","notes":"","gutter_credit":"","other":"","image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1495463849.5992","name":"f0083-01","source":"IMAGES:

If you haven’t noticed, Samsung has released the Galaxy S8 and S8+, and they’re pretty remarkable. As a former iPhone 7 Plus user, I think the S8+ might very well be the best phone I’ve ever used, with a stunning screen, speedy processor, and, yes, a gorgeous design.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0092-0151/439400-1-eng-US/f0092-012.jpg\" width=\"975\" height=\"630\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0092-01\" title=\"f0092-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>But what makes the S8 so amazing is how unique it is. I got to spend a week with it while writing <a href=\"http://go.macworld.com/s8rev\" target=\"_self\">my review</a>, and I came away stunned. For the first time in a while, Samsung is standing alone on the cutting edge with a phone that needs to be seen to be believed. From its barely there bezels to its brilliant wraparound screen, the Galaxy S8 truly gives Apple a run for its money. No joke, it actually makes the iPhone 7 look pretty stale.</p>\n<p>But there’s still a lot of time between now and the release of the next iPhone. According to <a href=\"http://go.macworld.com/i8r\" target=\"_self\">rumors</a>, the lineup this year will consist of the usual S models along with a fantabulous iPhone 8, which looks to adopt a similar aesthetic to the Galaxy S8, with an edge-to-edge OLED display and the removal of the physical home button. But just because it might look similar doesn’t mean it can’t still be better. Here’s how Apple can steal the crown from Samsung:</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0093-0139/439393-1-eng-US/f0093-012.jpg\" width=\"366\" height=\"208\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0093-01\" title=\"f0093-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>The Galaxy S8 has a killer camera but the iPhone 7 is no slouch.</b></p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>KILLER CAMERA</b></h3><p>The Galaxy S phones have always had a camera on a par with the iPhone, so it was a little surprising that Samsung didn’t upgrade the S8’s all that much. The iPhone 7 Plus is already a step ahead here, with 2X optical zoom and the sublime Portrait Mode, but the iPhone 8 could really separate itself from the S8 by taking it even further. Along with a megapixel bump, Apple could add optical image stabilization to the second lens, which will go a long way toward increasing photo and zoom quality. But what would really set it apart would be a larger sensor and greater ISO range to make it a low-light leader.</p>\n<h3><b>AR NOT VR</b></h3>\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0093-0211/439386-1-eng-US/f0093-022.jpg\" width=\"449\" height=\"646\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0093-02\" title=\"f0093-02\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>While Samsung is going all-in on virtual reality with the Galaxy Gear and the S8, rumors suggest that Apple is more interested in augmented reality. And that could be one of the features that sets the iPhone 8 apart. Smartphones have been slow to incorporate AR into the interface, but if Pokémon Go has taught us anything, it’s that people are way more interested in seeing the world through their screens than strapping a headset to their faces. An AR-fueled iPhone 8 could connect us to the world in fun new ways without separating us from reality.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0094-0142/439379-1-eng-US/f0094-012.jpg\" width=\"532\" height=\"380\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0094-01\" title=\"f0094-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>The Gear VR is a big part of the S8, but AR could be the iPhone 8’s big play.</b></p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>WELL-PLACED FINGERPRINT SENSOR</b></h3><p>While the Galaxy S8 is one of the best smartphones ever made, one tragic flaw prevented it from being perfect: the placement of the fingerprint sensor. For some god-awful reason, Samsung put it right next to the camera, all but ensuring your finger will not only miss it, but also repeatedly smudge the lens. If the rumors are correct that Apple will also be removing the home button in the iPhone 8, it has two options: under the screen or on the back. A first-ofits- kind in-panel sensor would be revolutionary, but if it’s on the back, Apple needs to learn from Samsung’s mistake and put it lower, like on the Pixel.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0094-029/439372-1-eng-US/f0094-022.jpg\" width=\"763\" height=\"462\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0094-02\" title=\"f0094-02\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>The Galaxy S8’s fingerprint sensor is just in the worst place.</b></p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>EXPANDED SIRI</b></h3><p>When Samsung unveiled the S8, a major part of the presentation was spent introducing its new AI assistant, Bixby. However, the new service wasn’t just a competitor to Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant. Samsung integrated Bixby deep into the interface to let it access apps, fetch information, and cut down on how often we need to touch our phones. It’s a cool idea, except the only problem is it doesn’t really work. If Apple could do something similar with Siri and expand its reach to work inside apps while we’re using them, it could beat Bixby at its own game.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0095-0213/439358-1-eng-US/f0095-022.jpg\" width=\"532\" height=\"445\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0095-02\" title=\"f0095-02\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>The Galaxy S8’s screen is pretty, and its software helps accentuate it.</b></p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>iOS 11</b></h3><p>One of the biggest gripes people have had about Samsung’s phones has always been its TouchWiz interface. But that’s changed with the S8, as Samsung has crafted an intuitive, refined system that takes full advantage of its superb hardware. If Apple is going to release a radically redesigned iPhone with curved edges and a wraparound screen, the same old iOS isn’t going to do it justice. It might be time to rethink iOS for modern times and give it more than new features and a fresh coat of pixels.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0095-0138/439365-1-eng-US/f0095-012.jpg\" width=\"569\" height=\"383\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0095-01\" title=\"f0095-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>Bixby hasn’t exactly exploded out of the gate, but it does a lot that Siri doesn’t do.</b></p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>TRUE WIRELESS CHARGING</b></h3><p>While Samsung has had wireless charging in the Galaxy S since the S6, Apple has been slow to adopt it for the iPhone. All signs indicate that’s going to change for the iPhone 8, but if Apple wants to top the Galaxy S8 and not just keep pace, it’s going to need something a little more exciting than a pretty charging pad. One of the rumors we’ve read suggests that Apple could adopt true long-range wireless charging for the next iPhone, which would power up the battery whenever you’re within range of the charger, even if it’s in your pocket. That alone would be an S8 killer.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0096-0158/439351-1-eng-US/f0096-012.jpg\" width=\"666\" height=\"402\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0096-01\" title=\"f0096-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>Samsung’s wireless charging supports Qi and PMA standards, and the pad stands up or lies flat.

Inside the S8 box is a pair of premium AKG-tuned earbuds that are a few steps above the usual build and sound quality you get for free—certainly better than what Apple gives us. But if Apple really wants to embrace the wireless future of the iPhone, it needs to stop including a wired set of EarPods, even if they are Lightning.
