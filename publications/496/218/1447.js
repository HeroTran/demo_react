But that’s not exactly fair, because Apple’s Clips isn’t social at all—it’s designed simply to help you create and edit fun videos. What you do with them after that is up to you.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0050-0169/438783-1-eng-US/f0050-012.jpg\" width=\"571\" height=\"573\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0050-01\" title=\"f0050-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>This approach makes Clips less anxietyinducing. To share a video on Instagram or Snapchat, you’ll want to shoot in Instagram or Snapchat to make sure the moment you’re capturing is perfectly framed. You can shoot in Clips, too, but this feels more like an app you’ll use after the moment has passed to stitch together memories and add a soundtrack and captions. Clips is way more low-key.</p>\n<p class=\"pullQuote\">You can also easily trim video clips—just tap on the clip in the timeline and then tap the scissor icon to edit the video down to just the seconds (or minutes) you want to include.</p>\n<p>But that doesn’t make it less complicated to use. In fact, it’s on a par with Snapchat when it comes to unintuitive design, so be prepared to spend an exorbitant amount of time creating your first clip. (We pray it gets easier the more you use it, but time will tell.) Here’s everything you need to know about using Apple Clips.</p>\n<h3><b>HOW TO USE CLIPS</b></h3><p>First things first: You need photos and videos to edit, right? Right. You can import them from your Camera Roll and stitch them together, or you can shoot photos or videos in-app. Pro tip: You can swipe left on the giant red Hold To Record button if you plan on filming for a while, to lock the camera in recording mode. Just tap the button again when you want to stop shooting. Clips defaults to the Instagram-esque square format, so if you’re importing media, make sure it’ll look good square. (Some might mind this, but I don’t.)</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0051-0140/438776-1-eng-US/f0051-012.jpg\" width=\"366\" height=\"651\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0051-01\" title=\"f0051-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>See those icons on top? They unlock all of your editing tools.</b></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>Along with a video-trimming tool, Clips has all the standard social video-editing features (filters, emojis, etc.) tucked behind icons at the top of the app. Tapping the speech-bubble icon adds captions in real time (more on this in a minute). Eight filters, ranging from black and white to my favorite Comic Book, are behind the interlocking circles icon. The star is hiding the time, your location, shapes like circles and arrows, and random words you can edit after adding them to your image or video. The T icon unlocks title cards that can help you tell your story—the text on these cards is also editable. The last option, a music note, is how you add a song from iTunes or an Apple-supplied tune to your video.</p>\n<p class=\"pullQuote\">It takes a while to get to know the various tools and tricks to make Clips work for you, but you’ve got this.</p>\n<p>It takes a while to get to know the various tools and tricks to make Clips work for you, but you’ve got this. And remember that creating a clip in Clips doesn’t mean that video goes anywhere but your Camera Roll. You have to take extra steps to share it with anyone or on any platform, which makes it extremely low-pressure.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0052-0165/438769-1-eng-US/f0052-012.jpg\" width=\"389\" height=\"757\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0052-01\" title=\"f0052-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n <span class=\"credit\">\nImage: Apple</span></figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>THE BEST CLIPS FEATURES</b></h3><p>Clips has a few features that set it apart from other video-editing apps, the most notable of which is Live Titles. That’s what Apple calls its real-time captioning tool, which is designed to make your video totally watchable without sound. This is perfect for scrolling through Facebook’s auto-playing News Feed, but also improves accessibility, making videos easy to watch for viewers who are deaf or hard of hearing. Live Titles supports 36 languages at launch, which is a feat for a brand-new app.</p>\n<p>The Live Titles feature doesn’t always nail the speech-to-text translation, though. I didn’t experience any captioning errors in my tests, but if you speak quickly and run your words together, you might confuse the algorithm parsing your sentences. Speak slowly and enunciate to avoid having to edit your captions. (I actually didn’t know this was possible, but the <i>Wall Street Journal</i>’s Joanna Stern <a href=\"http://go.macworld.com/wsjclips\" target=\"_self\">discovered</a> that you can edit a caption by tapping on the video clip, then pausing the video where the error appears on screen and tapping on the text. Yeah, it’s kind of a process.)</p>\n<p>But basically everything you see on screen is editable, which is incredibly useful. Every bit of text can be changed and even emojis can be easily swapped out by tapping on the emoji on screen and then tapping again to access your emoji keyboard.</p>\n<p class=\"pullQuote\">Live Titles supports 36 languages at launch, which is a feat for a brand-new app.</p>\n<p>In your first few hours with Clips, it’ll feel a little burdensome. But once you figure it out, creating social videos with Clips is a cinch.</p>\n<h3><b>TIME TO SHARE</b></h3><p>Once your masterpiece is finished, it’s time to share it. Clips uses facial recognition to figure out who’s in your video and then suggests that you use iMessage to send your video to those friends, which is really cool.</p>\n<p>You can also share a clip via email or post it to your go-to social networks, minus Snapchat. Snapchat is not designed for sharing what’s essentially a short social movie (not to mention the fact that clips are square and snaps are vertical). But clips seem tailor-made for sharing on Facebook in particular. Imagine creating movies of your kids or making your own DIY Tasty food recipe video with Clips. Post them to your page and watch the likes roll in.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0053-0151/438762-1-eng-US/f0053-012.jpg\" width=\"367\" height=\"652\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0053-01\" title=\"f0053-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>Turn on Live Titles as you’re speaking to automatically translate your words to text.</b></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>It’s a good thing Apple didn’t try to build a social network around Clips (lesson learned from Ping, perhaps). Instead, Apple is doing what it does best: giving creators the tools they need to make good work. Right now, popular media tends to be short and shareable. With Clips, maybe you too can snag 15 minutes—or more likely seconds—of viral video fame.</p>\n","layout":{"landscape":{"id":"am-landscape-9","link":"ioscentral_article_main-l.twig"},"portrait":{"id":"am-portrait-9","link":"ioscentral_article_main.twig"}},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":0,"link_source":"","competition":[],"flatplan_title":"","notes":"","gutter_credit":"","other":"","image":[{"id":"58fda9f8b2a29631525b40ac2501f1c2","name":"clips","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/clips2/468510-1-eng-US/clips.jpg?t=story_img_size_768x0&ext/clips_story_img_size_768x0.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"2500","height":"1519","legacy_id":"31580","is_default":true},{"id":"58fda9f8b2a29631525b40ac2501f1c2","name":"clips","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/clips2/468510-1-eng-US/clips.jpg?t=story_img_size_768x0&ext/clips_story_img_size_768x0.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"2500","height":"1519","legacy_id":"31580","is_default":false}],"related_objects":{"image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_4_1495463807.054","name":"f0053-01","source":"","caption":"<p><b>Turn on Live Titles as you’re speaking to automatically translate your words to text.</b></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0053-0151/438762-1-eng-US/f0053-012.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"367","height":"652","legacy_id":"29293"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_4_1495463807.054","name":"f0053-01","source":"","caption":"<p><b>Turn on Live Titles as you’re speaking to automatically translate your words to text.</b></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0053-0151/438762-1-eng-US/f0053-012.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"367","height":"652","legacy_id":"29293"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_3_1495463807.7869","name":"f0052-01","source":"Image: Apple","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0052-0165/438769-1-eng-US/f0052-012.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"389","height":"757","legacy_id":"29294"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_3_1495463807.7869","name":"f0052-01","source":"Image: Apple","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0052-0165/438769-1-eng-US/f0052-012.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"389","height":"757","legacy_id":"29294"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_2_1495463808.4078","name":"f0051-01","source":"","caption":"<p><b>See those icons on top?

Even the old Apple Watch Sport, which is the cheapest, weakest model, is built out of an aluminum alloy that Apple claims is 60 percent stronger than standard alloys.</p>\n<p>But the Apple Watch is still a wristbased watch, which means it’s <a href=\"http://go.macworld.com/watchbrk\" target=\"_self\">susceptible to damage</a> from scrapes and scratches. We took a look at several bumpers and cases that you can fit over your Watch’s case to protect it from this kind of superficial damage and keep it looking as good as new. Here’s how they held up, protectionand style-wise.</p>\n<h3><b>CASE-MATE SHEER GLAM AND CLEAR NAKED TOUGH BUMPER</b></h3><p>Case-Mate’s Naked Tough Bumper ($15) is available in two flavors—<a href=\"http://go.macworld.com/cmsglmb\" target=\"_self\">Sheer Glam</a>, which features tiny flecks of champagne glitter (and matches Case-Mate’s <a href=\"http://go.macworld.com/cmsglmb\" target=\"_self\">Sheer Glam Band</a>), and <a href=\"http://go.macworld.com/cmc\" target=\"_self\">Clear</a>, which is simply transparent. Both bumpers are available for the 38mm and the 42mm versions of the Apple Watch. The Naked Tough bumpers are made of flexible thermoplastic polyurethane, and actually offer quite a bit of protection because they cover most of the Watch, including the back (most of the other bumpers we tested for this piece only cover the sides and the front of the Watch, not the top, bottom, or back). To put the Naked Tough bumper on your Watch, you will need to remove the band and then stretch the bumper around the casing before putting the band back on.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/casemate-box/468871-1-eng-US/casemate-box.jpg\" width=\"384\" height=\"137\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"casemate-box\" title=\"casemate-box\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div>\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/casemate2/468222-1-eng-US/casemate.jpg\" width=\"494\" height=\"351\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"casemate\" title=\"casemate\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>Case-Mate’s Naked Tough Bumper in Sheer Glam (top and bottom left) and Clear (bottom middle and right).</b></p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>The bumper has cutouts for the digital crown, speakers, microphone (the case will cover the second microphone found on the Apple Watch Series 2 and 3, however), and the band release tabs on the back of the Watch. There’s also a cutout for the heart rate monitor to peek through, so you’ll be able to track your heart rate and charge the Watch without removing the bumper.</p>\n<p>The Sheer Glam bumper adds very subtle champagne-colored sparkle to your Watch, and it looks…about how you might expect it to look. While I like the idea of the Sheer Glam case, I think the champagne glitter sometimes makes the polyurethane look like it’s yellowing with age (instead of sparkly and glamorous). The Clear bumper seems slightly thinner than the Sheer Glam bumper (and, interestingly, is slightly less stretchy and therefore slightly more difficult to put on your Watch), and is nicely subtle in appearance. Both bumpers tend to trap debris, such as dust, dirt, and dog hair, inside, but it’s more obvious with the Clear bumper. While you don’t have to take this bumper off to swap bands or charge your Watch, you’ll want to take it off somewhat regularly for cleaning purposes.</p>\n<p class=\"pullQuote\">The Case-Mate Naked Tough bumper is a nice basic bumper for anyone who wants a little extra protection, but it has its cons.</p>\n<p>The Case-Mate Naked Tough bumper is a nice basic bumper for anyone who wants a little extra protection, but it has its cons. The cutout surrounding the digital crown is pretty snug, which can make it difficult to turn the crown multiple times. Because the bumper is made of a flexible material, it does slide around the screen a bit—and it looks like it has the potential to warp out of shape with a lot of use. But because the bands lock it in place, you definitely don’t have to worry about it snapping off and going missing.</p>\n<h3><b>CATALYST CASE FOR APPLE WATCH</b></h3><p>The Apple Watch Series 2 may be waterproof, but the Apple Watch Series 1 is merely water <i>resistant</i>—it will survive a rainstorm, but you probably shouldn’t wear it while you’re surfing or doing laps at the pool. For active people who like swimming, surfing, white-water rafting, and other water sports—or who are just clumsy and live in a wet environment—this is a problem if you still have Apple’s original model.</p>\n<p>Instead of dropping $370-plus on a brand-new Apple Watch, you might want to just pick up the <a href=\"http://go.macworld.com/ctlst42\" target=\"_self\">Catalyst Case</a> for Apple Watch ($60; same price <a href=\"http://go.macworld.com/ctlstamz\" target=\"_self\">on Amazon</a>). This rugged bumper-and-strap combo protects your Watch from dust, water (up to 50 meters deep), and drops, without compromising function. The Catalyst Case comes in three color combinations (black, black and gray with orange accents, and black and white with green accents) and is available for the 42mm Watch only.</p>\n<p>The polycarbonate and silicone case consists of three parts: The top, which is open to allow direct access to the Watch’s touchscreen; the silicone wrap, which wraps around your Watch and seals it off from the elements; and the bottom, which comes with an attached silicone band that can be replaced with any normal (not Apple Watch–specific) 24mm watch band. To put the case on your Watch, you will need to first remove a small screw that holds the case together and then snap the top off the bottom. You will then need to place the silicone wrap around your Watch—the wrap features a thin silicone membrane over the Watch’s heart rate monitor, so the monitor will still work through the case—and place the wrapped Watch into the case, snap the two parts back together, and replace the screw.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0057-0147/438903-1-eng-US/f0057-012.jpg\" width=\"356\" height=\"418\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0057-01\" title=\"f0057-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n <span class=\"credit\">\nImage: Catalyst</span></figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div>\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/catalyst-box/468869-1-eng-US/catalyst-box.jpg\" width=\"384\" height=\"137\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"catalyst-box\" title=\"catalyst-box\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>Once your Watch is inside the Catalyst Case, it’s pretty well protected from just about anything you can throw at it. The case has holes along the left side of the Watch for the speakers and the microphone (the speakers and the microphone holes are covered with a silicone membrane similar to the one on the bottom) and button coverings for the button and the digital crown. The silicone membranes allow you to use your Watch to the fullest—the membrane over the heart rate monitor even allows for inductive charging, so you never have to take the case off your Watch (unless you want to).</p>\n<p>The Catalyst Case is definitely the most protective bumper we tested for this piece, but it’s also very bulky and rugged-looking—hardly the slim, stylish look you’ll want for most settings. The silicone strap can be replaced with something less sporty, but it won’t make a difference— the case is just too big. Still, it’s a great option when you do need that extra ruggedness.</p>\n<h3><b>GRIFFIN ULTRA THIN CASE</b></h3><p>I hesitate to call Griffin’s <a href=\"http://go.macworld.com/grif38\" target=\"_self\">Ultra Thin Case</a> (pack of three for $15; same price <a href=\"http://go.macworld.com/grif38amz\" target=\"_self\">on Amazon</a>) a bumper—this aptly-named piece of polycarbonate is hardly going to protect your Apple Watch if you accidentally bang it into a wall or drop it on the floor. The Ultra Thin Case is more like a skin than a protective case.</p>\n<p>The Ultra Thin Case comes in a pack of three—gold/matte gold/clear, silver/matte silver/clear, or silver/matte gold/clear are your color options—and is available for both the 38mm Watch and the 42mm Watch. The Ultra Thin Case is ultra thin and lightweight, and each case weighs less than a gram (other bumpers weigh between two and three grams). The case covers the sides of the Watch and has holes and openings for the button, the digital crown, the two speaker slits, and the microphone. There is only one hole for the microphone, so this case will cover the second microphone hole on the Apple Watch Series 2.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/griffin2/468229-1-eng-US/griffin.jpg\" width=\"355\" height=\"409\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"griffin\" title=\"griffin\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>Griffin’s Ultra Thin Cases.</b></p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div>\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/griffin-box/468882-1-eng-US/griffin-box.jpg\" width=\"384\" height=\"137\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"griffin-box\" title=\"griffin-box\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>The good thing about an ultra-thin case is that it’s a (literal) snap to put on—the polycarbonate is so thin that it’s extremely flexible, which means it’s very easy to snap the case onto your Watch. The case only covers the sides of the Watch, so you do not need to take the straps off to put it on. Once it’s on, the case looks okay—the metallic colors are a little cheap-looking (and they’re definitely not going to fool anyone into thinking you have a different- colored Watch), but at a glance it can make for a fun change of pace. While the case probably won’t protect your phone from any real trauma, it does prevent the Watch case (but, of course, not the screen) from superficial scratches. The case is precisely made so that it doesn’t cover any necessary parts of the screen, and the cutouts—including the speaker slits and the microphone—line up perfectly with your Watch’s components.</p>\n<p>If having a shiny gold or silver Watch appeals to you, the Griffin Ultra Thin Case is a cheap, easy way to achieve that goal. But these bumpers aren’t for everyone— they’re extremely thin, not terribly protective, and they have a tendency to pop off just as easily as they pop on, so they probably won’t last as long as the other products we tested. I’d say these are a cute novelty item at best, but definitely not a necessary accessory.</p>\n<h3><b>SPECK CANDYSHELL FIT</b></h3><p>The Speck CandyShell Fit Apple Watch cases are modeled after Speck’s popular CandyShell line of phone cases. These protective bumpers are (for the most part) bright and bold and not subtle in the least, but that’s part of their appeal. There are actually two different versions of the CandyShell Fit cases ($24.95; $11.95 <a href=\"http://go.macworld.com/spckamz\" target=\"_self\">on Amazon</a>): The <a href=\"http://go.macworld.com/spkclr\" target=\"_self\">colored cases</a>, which are lined with rubber and have color-blocked accents; and the <a href=\"http://go.macworld.com/spkclrc\" target=\"_self\">clear cases</a>, which come in transparent clear or black. Both types are available for the 38mm and the 42mm models of the Apple Watch. The colored cases come in four color combinations: white/black, black/slate gray, crimson red/splash pink, and deep sea blue/maya blue.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0059-0160/438868-1-eng-US/f0059-012.jpg\" width=\"764\" height=\"382\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0059-01\" title=\"f0059-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>Speck CandyShell Fit.</b></p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div>\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/speck-box/468861-1-eng-US/speck-box.jpg\" width=\"384\" height=\"137\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"speck-box\" title=\"speck-box\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>The CandyShell Fit is pretty bulky compared to the other bumpers we tested for this piece because it features a deliberately raised bezel to help protect your Watch’s screen from drops. The outside of the case is made of glossy impact-resistant material, while the inside offers shock-absorption for protecting against bumps and collisions—not that your Watch really needs a ton of protection from bumps, but this can certainly help if you happen to drop it. The Candy- Shell Fit is rigid and snaps on over the top of your Watch, so it covers the sides and the front, but not the back. Unlike the Griffin Ultra Thin Case and the Trident Apple Watch Guards, this case covers the corners of the Watch, so you will need to take it off if you want to swap bands.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/speck2/468236-1-eng-US/speck.jpg\" width=\"738\" height=\"199\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"speck\" title=\"speck\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>Speck CandyShell Fit.</b></p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>The case has a button cover for the Watch’s side button, a cutout for the digital crown, and additional cutouts for the speaker and the microphone. There’s only one cutout for the speaker and one cutout for the microphone, so if you have an Apple Watch Series 1, one of your speaker slits will be covered. If you have an Apple Watch Series 2, one of your speaker slits will be covered and one of your microphones will be covered.</p>\n<p>Although the CandyShell Fit cases add bulk and weight to your Watch, I actually like the aesthetic—the bulkiness looks deliberate rather than clunky, and the colored cases especially make a pretty bold statement when paired with a matching Sport band. The clear cases are not nearly as fashionable—they’re just as thick but nowhere near as bold, and they have Speck’s logo splashed across the side.</p>\n<h3><b>TRIDENT GUARD</b></h3><p>Trident’s Guard bumper protects your Apple Watch’s body from scrapes and scratches, but not much else. The Guard comes in a pack of three, similar to the Griffin Ultra Thin Case. The <a href=\"http://go.macworld.com/trid38\" target=\"_self\">38mm pack</a> ($15 for three) features black, white, and coral pink bumpers, while the <a href=\"http://go.macworld.com/trid42\" target=\"_self\">42mm pack</a> ($15 for three) features black, white, and navy blue bumpers.</p>\n<p>The Trident Guard is a basic snap-on bumper made of durable-feeling polycarbonate with a soft-touch matte finish. The Guard is flexible enough that it’s not difficult to snap on (or off) your Watch, but it’s nowhere near as flimsy as Griffin’s Ultra Thin Case. It’s a nice compromise between the Ultra Thin Case, which offers virtually no protection and is easy to lose, and the Speck CandyShell Fit, which is quite thick and bulky.</p>\n<p>The Guard has cutouts for the Watch button, the digital crown, one speaker slit, and the microphone. The Guard doesn’t wrap quite as far around the Watch as some of the other bumpers do, so the second speaker is also left uncovered; however, the second microphone on the Apple Watch Series 2 and 3 will be covered by this case. Although the Guard bumper is relatively thin, the thickness of the case does make it slightly harder to twist and turn the digital crown while you’re wearing your Watch. The Guard also has cutouts at the corners, so you can swap bands without taking it off.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/trident2/468243-1-eng-US/trident.jpg\" width=\"528\" height=\"240\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"trident\" title=\"trident\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>Trident Guard.</b></p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div>\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/trident-box/468854-1-eng-US/trident-box.jpg\" width=\"384\" height=\"137\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"trident-box\" title=\"trident-box\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p class=\"pullQuote\">Do you <i>really</i> need a bumper for your Apple Watch? I’ll be honest—probably not.</p>\n<p>The Guard definitely stands out—in a good way—when you put it on your Watch. The matte finish really changes the look of your device without being gimmicky, and it makes a pretty bold, stylish fashion statement. The only real issue I had with the Guard is the fact that the bezel surrounding the screen is sharply squared-off and it encroaches quite a bit on your screen real estate. It doesn’t cover any of the necessary parts of the screen, but it can make tapping at the edges of the Watch a bit more difficult.</p>\n<p>Trident’s Guard looks good, is easy to put on, and won’t fall off your Watch while you’re wearing it. I wouldn’t necessarily trust it to protect your Watch from drops, but I think it does an adequate job of keeping your Watch’s case from sustaining scrapes and scratches during normal wear.</p>\n<h3><b>BOTTOM LINE: OUR FAVORITE PICK</b></h3><p>Do you <i>really</i> need a bumper for your Apple Watch? I’ll be honest—probably not. Most of these bumpers will protect your Watch from superficial scratches at best, and aren’t going to help you if you drop it off a cliff or into the toilet (except for the Catalyst, which looks like it’s made for some outdoorsy wear-and-tear). Most bumpers also don’t protect the most important part of the Watch (the screen), so if you happen to be slamming your wrist against doorjambs and walls, I suggest you invest in a screen protector instead.</p>\n<p>With that in mind, the Trident Guard bumper came out on top: Not only is the Guard sturdy and easy to snap on and off your Watch, it’s also the only bumper that looks less like a protective measure and more like a style choice. The Guard makes your Watch look like an entirely different product, and in a good way. Speck’s CandyShell Fit is also pretty stylish, but only if you’ve already got a thing for Speck’s brightly-colored Candy- Shell aesthetic.</p>\n","layout":{"landscape":{"id":"am-landscape-10","link":"ioscentral_article_01-l.twig"},"portrait":{"id":"am-portrait-10","link":"ioscentral_article_01.twig"}},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":0,"link_source":"","competition":[],"flatplan_title":"","notes":"","gutter_credit":"","other":"","image":[{"id":"e0340ffc1dea83d1f0c592adbc0b0c7a","name":"watch-water","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/watch-water3/468215-1-eng-US/watch-water.jpg?t=story_img_size_768x0&ext/watch-water_story_img_size_768x0.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"1961","height":"1262","legacy_id":"31556","is_default":true},{"id":"e0340ffc1dea83d1f0c592adbc0b0c7a","name":"watch-water","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/watch-water3/468215-1-eng-US/watch-water.jpg?t=story_img_size_768x0&ext/watch-water_story_img_size_768x0.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"1961","height":"1262","legacy_id":"31556","is_default":false}],"related_objects":{"image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_18_1495463810.9335","name":"f0061-03","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0061-036/438819-1-eng-US/f0061-032.jpg?t=story_img_size_768x0&ext/f0061-032_story_img_size_768x0.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"366","height":"346","legacy_id":"29300"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_18_1495463810.9335","name":"f0061-03","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0061-036/438819-1-eng-US/f0061-032.jpg?t=story_img_size_768x0&ext/f0061-032_story_img_size_768x0.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"366","height":"346","legacy_id":"29300"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_17_1495463811.6781","name":"f0061-02","source":"","caption":"<p><b>Trident

Uber almost got itself kicked out of the iOS App Store. Apple CEO Tim Cook brought Uber CEO Travis Kalanick into the company’s Cupertino offices and laid down the law, the <a href=\"http://go.macworld.com/nytuber\" target=\"_self\"><i>New York Times</i> reported</a>.</p>\n<p>So what exactly did Uber do to land itself in hot water with Apple? The original NYT report initially said the company was tracking iPhones, but it has since been clarified to describe Uber’s actions as “identifying and tagging iPhones even after its app has been deleted and the devices erased.” The reason Uber did that, the company said, was to prevent phone thieves in China from creating Uber accounts and requesting rides before wiping the devices and doing so again and again.</p>\n<p>“We absolutely do not track individual users or their location if they’ve deleted the app,” an Uber spokesperson told <a href=\"http://go.macworld.com/tcuber\" target=\"_self\">TechCrunch</a>. “As the <i>New York Times</i> story notes towards the very end, this is a typical way to prevent fraudsters from loading Uber onto a stolen phone, putting in a stolen credit card, taking an expensive ride and then wiping the phone—over and over again. Similar techniques are also used for detecting and blocking suspicious logins to protect our users’ accounts. Being able to recognize known bad actors when they try to get back onto our network is an important security measure for both Uber and our users.”</p>\n<p>But how exactly did Uber track devices after they had been wiped? Security expert <a href=\"http://go.macworld.com/strafach\" target=\"_self\">Will Strafach</a> looked at a 2014 build of Uber’s app and found the company was using private APIs to pull iPhone serial numbers from the device registry using Apple’s IOKit framework. Uber’s fingerprinting technique doesn’t work in iOS 10, so the company can’t identify your device after you delete the app, Strafach noted (as spotted in a worthwhile read <a href=\"http://go.macworld.com/dfuber\" target=\"_self\">on Daring Fireball</a>).</p>\n<p class=\"pullQuote\">Apple found that Uber was not only violating the App Store developer rules, but trying to cover its tracks by geofencing its code so Cupertino app reviewers wouldn’t see the private APIs at work.</p>\n<p>Apparently, Uber’s fingerprinting wasn’t a big enough privacy violation to get kicked out of the App Store. Apple found that Uber was not only violating the App Store developer rules, but trying to cover its tracks by geofencing its code so Cupertino app reviewers wouldn’t see the private APIs at work. That didn’t work for long, which is how Kalanick ended up in Cook’s office. According to the <i>Times,</i> Kalanick was visibly shaken by the encounter.</p>\n<p><b>Why this matters:</b> Uber is having a rough year entirely of its own making. It’s unclear if this latest privacy kerfuffle will inspire more Uber users to delete the app, as they did when widespread allegations of workplace harassment came to light and a video of Kalanick yelling at an Uber driver emerged. But it is clear that Uber needs to do something to fix its public relations problems. Maybe not acting so terrible all the time would be a good place to start.</p>\n","layout":{"landscape":{"id":"am-landscape-10","link":"ioscentral_article_01-l.twig"},"portrait":{"id":"am-portrait-10","link":"ioscentral_article_01.twig"}},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":0,"link_source":"","competition":[],"flatplan_title":"","notes":"","gutter_credit":"","other":"","image":[{"id":"a071b2f2d64ead2a8126ef7c8dd9281f","name":"uber","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/uber2/468250-1-eng-US/uber.jpg?t=story_img_size_768x0&ext/uber_story_img_size_768x0.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"4870","height":"2761","legacy_id":"31561","is_default":true},{"id":"a071b2f2d64ead2a8126ef7c8dd9281f","name":"uber","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/uber2/468250-1-eng-US/uber.jpg?t=story_img_size_768x0&ext/uber_story_img_size_768x0.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"4870","height":"2761","legacy_id":"31561","is_default":false}],"related_objects":{"image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1495463824.6785","name":"f0063-01","source":"IMAGE: FREESTOCKS.ORG","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0063-0152/438974-1-eng-US/f0063-012.jpg?t=story_img_size_768x0&ext/f0063-012_story_img_size_768x0.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"975","height":"885","legacy_id":"29321"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1495463824.6785","name":"f0063-01","source":"IMAGE: FREESTOCKS.ORG","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0063-0152/438974-1-eng-US/f0063-012.jpg?t=story_img_size_768x0&ext/f0063-012_story_img_size_768x0.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"975","height":"885","legacy_id":"29321"}]},"url_alias":"http://macworld-us.audiencemedia.com","type":"story","order":"11","folio_number":"63","folio_numbers":"63,64","pdf_page_index":"63","thumbnail":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/uber2/468250-1-eng-US/uber.jpg?t=tablet_story_thumbnail&ext/uber_tablet_story_thumbnail.jpg","color":"2699cd","real_id":"29320","main_section_id":"1447","ads":[]},{"id":"zinio_218_100340926_1495463825.8593","title":"PERI DUO: BULKY iPHONE BATTERY CASE WITH SPEAKERS DOESN’T QUITE GO TO 11","sub_title":"Reviews | Peri Duo","author":[{"id":"0","name":"J.R.

Unlike many cases that require a crowbar to pry a device from its grasp, this one uses a patent-pending mechanism that slides down the Lightning connector, clearing a path for the iPhone to be inserted with ease. Slide the connector into the iPhone and it’s snugly secure in the case.</p>\n<p>While powered on and attached to the case, the Lightning connection sends audio directly to the speakers for up to 15 hours of playback on a single charge. But it also taps into the case’s built-in 2,900 mAh battery, enough to charge up a completely depleted iPhone with another 20 percent in the case to spare. The case can only be recharged using the micro-USB jack on the bottom, but on the plus side, both the Duo and the attached iPhone charge simultaneously connected this way.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0066-0167/439017-1-eng-US/f0066-012.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"589\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0066-01\" title=\"f0066-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>Rugged protection with a pair of four-watt speakers on the back for playing music while the iPhone 6/6s is docked, or via Bluetooth and AirPlay.</b></p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>NO ORDINARY CASE</b></h3><p>Although the Peri Duo works best with an attached iPhone 6/6s, the case also supports Bluetooth, making it compatible with a wide range of devices for up to 20 hours of music playback at a time.

Unfortunately, the four-watt speakers aren’t quite up to this challenge, since they only pump out a maximum volume of 100 dB. They do sound better than an iPhone 7 alone with similar stereo separation, but are no match for decent Bluetooth speakers.</p>\n\n<div>\n<table bgcolor=\"#eeeeee\">\n<tr>\n    <td>\n    <h3>PERI DUO FOR iPHONE 6/6s</h3>\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/3mice6/468257-1-eng-US/3mice.png\" width=\"215\" height=\"144\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"3mice\" title=\"3mice\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h4>PRICE</h4><p>$190</p>\n\n    </td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n</div><p>Using the free Peri Audio companion app, the Quick Link feature allows up to 64 of the company’s cases to wirelessly stream the same tune. I was unable to test this feature, but it certainly sounds neat. The main limitation is that a single Duo case is rather pricey, so you’ll need friends with deep pockets to get that party started. There are four color options to choose from: White/ Silver, Red/Charcoal, Rhymesayers, and Black/Silver. Since my own iPhone 7 Plus doesn’t fit, I hijacked my wife’s iPhone 6s for testing. She was rather embarrassed being seen in public holding a bulky case with two silver speaker grilles on the back, but younger kids thought it was cool.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n

The ear has become a popular place to put a sensor, because properly fitting earphones will stay put and presumably measure your heart rate more accurately than a wristworn sensor prone to moving around during exercise. That’s why companies like Samsung, JBL, Jabra, and Bose are shipping biosensing Bluetooth earphones designed for workouts.</p>\n<p>Wearable technology company LifeBeam raked in $1.7 million on Kickstarter last summer to produce a new kind of heart rate-tracking headphones called <a href=\"https://getvi.com\" target=\"_self\">Vi</a>. And while Vi has an optical heart rate sensor built in, that’s not really its selling point. What sets these headphones apart is Vi herself, a voice coach rooted in artificial intelligence that guides you through your workouts. There are several fitness apps with voice-coaching that aren’t tied to a specific pair of headphones, but those trainers sound like robots. Vi actually sounds like a person you’d want to talk to—and you can.</p>\n<h3><b>GETTING STARTED</b></h3><p>Vi was a Kickstarter success story, but it doesn’t look like crowdfunded hardware.</p>\n<p>Like most Bluetooth headphones, Vi comes with a sizing kit of gel tips and fins so you can customize the earbud fit to your ears. This part is important, because if the headphones don’t fit properly, they won’t be able to track your heart rate. Also included in the box are a small carrying case and a USB charger. These headphones get up to eight hours of battery life on a single charge, which means you can squeeze in a few days of run-tracking or charge them at night if you’re wearing them all day.</p>\n<p>To power on the headphones, press the multifunction button on the right side of the neckband. Vi introduces herself with a robot joke, and this is where you’ll notice that her voice is unlike other fitness-coaching assistants in other apps. It’s more… human. More conversational. Even when giving you a readout of your pace, mileage, and heart rate, Vi sounds like a person and not a bot.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0069-0150/439095-1-eng-US/f0069-012.jpg\" width=\"763\" height=\"459\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0069-01\" title=\"f0069-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>Install the Vi Fitness app (available for iOS and Android) and pair the earbuds with your phone in your Bluetooth settings, as is standard for wireless headphones. Then tell Vi your name in-app. She’ll ask you how to pronounce it, and if she can’t get it right, she’ll ask you to pick a nickname. She’s gonna be talking to you <i>a lot</i>, so make sure you pick a name you’ll want to be called.</p>\n<h3><b>LIKE SIRI FOR WORKOUTS</b></h3><p>Vi’s heart rate data, once you properly position the left earbud’s optical sensor, is spot on. I compared Vi’s stats to my Apple Watch Series 2, which is one of the most accurate heart rate–tracking bands I’ve tested, and the two matched up almost perfectly.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0070-0174/439088-1-eng-US/f0070-012.jpg\" width=\"558\" height=\"402\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0070-01\" title=\"f0070-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>Make sure you pick the right size earphone gels and wings to get a good fit.</b></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n <span class=\"credit\">\nImage: LifeBeam</span></figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>Vi’s coaching varies depending on the goals you set up in-app, but I found her advice useful—and unlike most fitness apps, it’s not repetitive or overly talkative. First you need to log two hours of runtime so Vi can get used to you. Afterward, you can adjust the voice-coaching frequency in-app. I selected the chattiest option, but Vi still only piped in once every five minutes or so. That’s a solid amount of coaching for a 3.5-mile, 35-minute run. For me, her advice ranged from “boost your step count by running to this beat” (which seriously works) and admonishing me for my erratic pace to congratulating me on squeezing in a run before the afternoon’s impending thunderstorm and singing Rihanna’s “Work” as I reached a milestone. (I definitely laughed at that one.)</p>\n<p class=\"pullQuote\">The earphones have a built-in microphone with noise cancellation so you can ask Vi to tell you your stats while you run by tapping your right earbud.</p>\n<p>The earphones have a built-in microphone with noise cancellation so you can ask Vi to tell you your stats while you run by tapping your right earbud. In my experience running with these headphones through Brooklyn over the past week and a half, Vi doesn’t always know when you’re speaking. The combination of tall buildings, trees, and my run-induced breathlessness certainly didn’t help, and Vi’s response time to an earbud tap had an annoyingly long lag. I ended up eyeing my stats in-app while pausing at stoplights rather than ask Vi to give me the rundown.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0071-0153/439081-1-eng-US/f0071-012.jpg\" width=\"208\" height=\"458\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0071-01\" title=\"f0071-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>You can’t actually hold a conversation with Vi, so don’t think of this AI assistant as a real-life version of Samantha from <i>Her.</i> Vi is more like Siri for workouts, but with a much more pleasant tone.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/vi2/468278-1-eng-US/vi.jpg\" width=\"417\" height=\"360\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"vi\" title=\"vi\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>Vi’s app for iOS averages your total mileage and also graphs data from each run.</b></p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>THE FIT AND FEEL</b></h3><p>I’m always a little skeptical when it comes to crowdfunded hardware, but Vi’s design and quality are top-of-the-line.

The neckband is comfortable to wear on long runs.</p>\n<p>The sizing kit that comes with the headphones helps to ensure that the heart rate sensor is snuggled perfectly inside your ear, and Vi offers video tutorials in-app to help you get the right fit. But I also wish Vi would alert you when she can’t detect your heart rate. I lost a few minutes of data when my earbud shifted slightly on a windy day (unbeknownst to me), and didn’t realize it until I looked at the app screen. Other heart rate–sensing headphones offer this, and Vi should, too. That’s an easy enough fix, and one I hope is made soon.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0072-0174/439060-1-eng-US/f0072-012.jpg\" width=\"763\" height=\"577\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0072-01\" title=\"f0072-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>These headphones are perfect for outdoor runners, but they’re a little too expensive for other fitness buffs.</b></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n <span class=\"credit\">\nImage: Caitlin McGarry</span></figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>But the 1.3-ounce headphones are incredibly lightweight and boast a barometer, accelerometer, and gyrometer so you get more than just heart rate data when you put in your miles.

LifeBeam CEO Omri Yoffe told me the company is hyper-focused on nailing this specific feature, and it has. But for a $250 pair of headphones designed around fitness coaching, Vi has to add other workouts. Quickly.
