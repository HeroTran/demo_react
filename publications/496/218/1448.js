With your iCloud password, you can access such personal data as your iCloud mail messages, your calendar, your contacts, and your stored iCloud credit cards. Your iCloud password could even be used to track, lock, and wipe your precious devices.</p>\n<p>Needless to say, it would be a very bad thing if your iCloud password landed in the wrong hands. But by taking just a few basic steps, you can secure your iCloud account from the most common threats, and you can take all those steps directly from your device.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0100-0143/439457-1-eng-US/f0100-012.jpg\" width=\"458\" height=\"320\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0100-01\" title=\"f0100-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>Changing your iCloud password may be a royal pain, but it’s the best way to protect your account from hackers.</b></p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>Let’s start with the easiest—and most important—way to protect your iCloud password, which is...</p>\n<h3><b>CHANGE YOUR PASSWORD (AND DON’T USE THE SAME ONE TWICE)</b></h3><p>Yes, I heard that groan, and I feel your pain. I just changed my own iCloud password recently (and after far too long), and it meant logging back into iCloud on a bunch of my devices, including my iMac, my iPhone, my iPad, my Apple TV, and my third-party email clients.</p>\n<p>Not only do you need to change your password, you also need to create a <a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/strongpwds\" target=\"_self\">“strong” password</a>—that is, a password that’s at least 12 characters long (the longer the better, actually), with a random combination of letters, numbers and symbols.</p>\n<p>To make matters even more complicated, your iCloud password should be unique, as should be the passwords for all your other Internet accounts. (If all that sounds too difficult to keep track of, consider investing in a <a href=\"http://go.macworld.com/4pwm\" target=\"_self\">password manager</a>. Trust me, they’re lifesavers.)</p>\n<p>Changing your iCloud password can be annoying, but it’s the best way to foil hackers, particularly those who steal passwords from one service and use the same passwords to break into others—and indeed, that’s what Apple says happened in the recent case of a hacker group that claimed to have stolen millions of iCloud passwords.</p>\n<p>To change your iCloud password directly from an iPhone, iPad, or other iOS device, tap Settings → Apple ID → Password &amp; Security → Change Password.</p>\n<h3><b>TURN ON TWO-FACTOR AUTHENTICATION</b></h3><p>Was that another groan I heard? Again, I understand. While two-factor authentication means another layer of protection for your iCloud account, it also means another layer of hassle for you.</p>\n<p>That said, turning on <a href=\"http://go.macworld.com/ap2fa\" target=\"_self\">two-factor authentication</a> will make it tough for all but the most dedicated hackers to crack your iCloud account. Better still, you can use two-factor authentication in place of those (absurdly weak) iCloud security questions, such as “What was the name of your first pet?”</p>\n<p>Tap Settings → Apple ID → Password &amp; Security → Two-Factor Authentication, enter your phone number, then choose how you want to receive your verification number: either via text message or voice call. Plug in the verification number once it arrives, and you’re all set. Alternatively, you can turn on two-factor from your Mac, by going to System Preferences → iCloud, clicking Account Details under your name, signing in, and looking in the Security tab.</p>\n<p>Now, the next time you try to log in to your iCloud account with a new device, you’ll need a temporary six-digit authentication code in addition to your standard iCloud password.</p>\n<p>The code will arrive on one of your “trusted” devices (more on that in a moment), along with a notification showing you where the login attempt took place. If you recognize the location, go ahead and tap Continue to get the six-digit code—or, if it looks like someone is trying to break into your iCloud account, you can block the login attempt.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0101-0133/439450-1-eng-US/f0101-012.jpg\" width=\"496\" height=\"286\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0101-01\" title=\"f0101-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>Most hackers will look for an easier victim once they see you’ve protected your iCloud account with two-factor authentication.</b></p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div>\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0101-027/439443-1-eng-US/f0101-022.jpg\" width=\"498\" height=\"286\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0101-02\" title=\"f0101-02\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>Make sure to add one or more additional “trusted” phone numbers to your iCloud account in case you lose access to your primary number.</b></p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>ADD MORE “TRUSTED” PHONE NUMBERS</b></h3><p>When you first enable two-factor authentication for your iCloud account, you’ll be asked to enter a “trusted” number where you’ll receive your verification code.</p>\n<p>While one such trusted number is enough, you can also enter more phone numbers—such as, say, your landline number, your office number, or the digits of a friend or loved one.

cross-platform task master Wunderlist, but you wouldn’t know it to look at it. Unlike Sunrise and Accompli, which were shuttered and combined into Outlook mobile, Wunderlist has mostly been left alone. But now Microsoft is finally ready to show off what it’s been working on.</p>\n<p>Called <a href=\"http://go.macworld.com/mstodopre\" target=\"_self\">Microsoft To-Do</a>, the new app might have an uninspired name, but it’s been completely reimagined. With a simple design and ultra-minimal interface, the app looks like a pretty standard task manager, allowing you to create to-dos and lists, and add reminders and due dates. You can add notes inside tasks, but there doesn’t seem to be a way to create subtasks like you could in Wunderlist.</p>\n<p>The notable addition in To-Do is the focused My Day screen, which keeps lists and to-dos hidden until they need to get done. As Microsoft describes, “Every morning, your My Day list starts out with a clean slate, allowing you to be more intentional about what you want to get done.” However, all your tasks are still available in the slide-out sidebar, so you can always get an overview of your schedule.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0104-0137/439493-1-eng-US/f0104-012.jpg\" width=\"604\" height=\"409\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0104-01\" title=\"f0104-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>Also new is Intelligent Suggestions, which will collect imminent to-dos and automatically add them to your day. To get to your suggestions, tap the lightbulb icon at the top right of the My Day screen, and you’ll see completed tasks from the prior day, whatever is due or upcoming, and “other helpful suggestions based on To-Do’s smart algorithm.” From there you’ll be able to add any of them to the My Day screen.</p>\n<p>Notably missing from To-Do (along with any pro-level features) is integration with Office 365, but Microsoft says it will be added in the coming months, starting with Outlook. Microsoft also has made security a top priority in To-Do, with end-to-end encryption.</p>\n<p>The preview version of the app is available <a href=\"https://todo.microsoft.com/en-us/\" target=\"_self\">on the web</a>, as well as on iOS, Android, and Windows 10 devices, with the final version arriving later this year. In the meantime, Wunderlist will continue to exist, and Microsoft promises to add “more of the favorite elements of Wunderlist into the To-Do experience,” adding list sharing, and bringing support for the Mac, iPad, and Android tablets.</p>\n<p><b>The impact on you at home:</b> Microsoft To-Do is clearly just a start. The app is incredibly basic at the moment, with the most rudimentary of features for a task manager, but it’s still worth a download to check it out. Like Wunderlist, the design and navigation are top-notch, and the intelligent suggestions could very well turn into an awesome feature. But there is a long way to go if Microsoft expects it to ever reach the level of Wunderlist or Todoist.</p>\n","layout":{"landscape":{"id":"am-landscape-19","link":"workingmac_02-l.twig"},"portrait":{"id":"am-portrait-19","link":"workingmac_02.twig"}},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":0,"link_source":"","competition":[],"flatplan_title":"","notes":"","gutter_credit":"","other":"","image":[{"id":"4b797fc386c3f108ae6c5fba0b3ac32b","name":"todo","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/todo/468676-1-eng-US/todo.jpg?t=story_img_size_768x0&ext/todo_story_img_size_768x0.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"780","height":"560","legacy_id":"31596","is_default":true},{"id":"4b797fc386c3f108ae6c5fba0b3ac32b","name":"todo","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/todo/468676-1-eng-US/todo.jpg?t=story_img_size_768x0&ext/todo_story_img_size_768x0.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"780","height":"560","legacy_id":"31596","is_default":false}],"related_objects":{"image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_1_1495463862.623","name":"f0104-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0104-0137/439493-1-eng-US/f0104-012.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"604","height":"409","legacy_id":"29386"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_1_1495463862.623","name":"f0104-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0104-0137/439493-1-eng-US/f0104-012.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"604","height":"409","legacy_id":"29386"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1495463863.2964","name":"f0103-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0103-0139/439500-1-eng-US/f0103-012.jpg?t=story_img_size_768x0&ext/f0103-012_story_img_size_768x0.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"880","height":"360","legacy_id":"29387"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1495463863.2964","name":"f0103-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0103-0139/439500-1-eng-US/f0103-012.jpg?t=story_img_size_768x0&ext/f0103-012_story_img_size_768x0.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"880","height":"360","legacy_id":"29387"}]},"url_alias":"http://macworld-us.audiencemedia.com","type":"story","order":"19","folio_number":"103","folio_numbers":"103,104","pdf_page_index":"103","thumbnail":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/todo/468676-1-eng-US/todo.jpg?t=tablet_story_thumbnail&ext/todo_tablet_story_thumbnail.jpg","color":"2699cd","real_id":"29385","main_section_id":"1448","ads":[]},{"id":"zinio_218_100340926_1495463864.4193","title":"How to use your iPhone or iPad as a wireless hotspot","sub_title":"","author":[{"id":"0","name":"NICK MEDIATI","email":"noreply@audiencemedia.com","is_default":false}],"tag":"","strap_line":"WIRELESS HOTSPOT","intro":"The personal hotspot feature on your iOS device can bail you out when a broadband connection isn’t available.

After scurrying around the house in a panic—I was in the middle of a story—my sister came to the rescue with her iPad, which she set up as an Internet hot spot.</p>\n<p>Whew.</p>\n<p>Setting up a wireless hotspot on your iOS device is a simple process, and it’s useful for more than bailing out freakedout freelance tech journalists. Here’s how to go about it.</p>\n<p>Before you begin, you’ll need to make sure your cellular service plan supports the wireless hotspot feature. If it doesn’t, check with your carrier for plan pricing and availability. Also, you’ll need to make sure your iPhone or iPad has mobile data switched on. Lastly, keep in mind that any data you use will most likely count against your plan’s data cap, so you’ll want to avoid downloading massive files while on the hotspot.</p>\n<h3><b>SETTING UP AND CONNECTING TO A HOTSPOT</b></h3><p>Open the Settings app and tap Personal Hotspot (it’s listed as Cellular Data on the iPad). Then, on the next screen, tap the Personal Hotspot switch so it’s in the On position (the switch will turn green). Next, make a note of your Wi-Fi password listed on this screen. If you don’t have Wi-Fi enabled on your iPhone or iPad, you’ll be asked to switch it on at this point.</p>\n<p>Now, go to your Mac or PC, pop open the Wi-Fi network menu, then select your iOS device’s name and enter the password as you would normally do when you connect to a Wi-Fi network.</p>\n<p>When you’re done, go back to Settings → Personal Hotspot (or Settings → Cellular Data → Personal Hotspot) and switch off the hotspot.</p>\n<h3><b>USING INSTANT HOTSPOT</b></h3><p>If you’ve got an iPhone or cellularequipped iPad running iOS 8 or later and a Mac running OS X Yosemite or later— and you have both devices set up under the same Apple ID—you can easily activate your iOS device’s hotspot feature from the comfort of your own Mac. For this to work, both devices need to meet Apple’s Continuity <a href=\"http://go.macworld.com/applcsr\" target=\"_self\">system requirements</a>. From there, it’s a simple matter of selecting the hotspot-enabled iOS device from the Wi-Fi menu in your Mac’s menu bar.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n

title=\"flocker\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p><b>W</b>hen security researcher Jonathan Zdziarski took a job at Apple recently, I heard from many people concerned about the future of his macOS app, Little Flocker, a tool that restricts apps and system processes access to files without permission. He was unable to talk details, but recently F-Secure, a leading security developer and analysis company, announced its purchase of Little Flocker, which it’s rebranded as <a href=\"https://campaigns.f-secure.com/xfence\" target=\"_self\">Xfence</a>.</p>\n<p>I spoke to Sean Sullivan, security advisor at F-Secure, about the changeover and the general current set of risks to Mac users. He said Xfence, which was in release form as Little Flocker, will shift into a free beta mode for the foreseeable future. (Those who paid for a Little Flocker license will get some currently unspecified benefit as future pricing for Xfence and its inclusion in other products isn’t yet set. “Their license will carry through when there’s a paid product,” Sullivan said.)</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://littleflocker.com\" target=\"_self\">littleflocker.com</a> domain remains up, showing a maintenance page and the Check For Updates link, which queries that domain, currently doesn’t work. That should change when the new beta is released with Xfence branding.</p>\n<p>For those who haven’t read about Little Flocker in the past, it was designed to combat ransomware, which is the greatest new scourge in the Windows world. Ransomware overwrites your documents with encrypted versions and the attackers demand payment, typically in Bitcoin, to release a decryption key. A few feeble attempts have been made to infect Macs, but because ransomware has such a low threshold to cause harm and such a high reward-to-cost ratio, you can be sure attackers are hard at work.</p>\n<p>Little Flocker observes every time an app tries to open, write, execute, or otherwise modify any file or folder, and lets you set one-time, short-term, or permanent exceptions. It also has rulesets that it offers to add when it recognizes an app. Because Apple has its registered developers sign released apps with cryptographic signatures, the monitoring system isn’t fooled by malicious programs with the same name trying to inherit file privileges. Later updates added monitoring and blocking of audio or video input activation.</p>\n<p class=\"pullQuote\">The intent with the Xfence release is to make it part of a multi-pronged method of helping users by making smarter deductions about what normal activity is.</p>\n<p>Sullivan said part of F-Secure’s goal to move Xfence forward will make it more accessible to a greater number of users. He’s right that that’s needed. While Little Flocker is invaluable if you want to know how apps are interacting with files and folders on your Mac, even the simplified mode requires too much system knowledge for the majority of users. It’s a tool for veteran Mac owners and system administrators.</p>\n<p>Little Flocker also didn’t provide great help for people who use a macOS account without administrative privileges. Some people prefer to work at a lowerprivilege level, as it reduces the impact of a security breach; others are users on a computer (family, work, or school) for which they don’t have administrative access. Ostensibly, Xfence will need to let an administrative user approve apps or delegate certain approval privileges, similar to parental controls.</p>\n<p>The current release also requires a lot of interaction, though it decreases over time. As an experienced user wanting to see all the interaction, I don’t mind when new software or a software update requires that I approve a number of requests. But a less-interested or lessadvanced Mac owner might prefer to only have dubious actions highlighted.</p>\n<p>Sullivan said Xfence will benefit from F-Secure’s broader array of products and malware monitoring. For instance, the company’s Security Cloud system anonymously gathers information from users of its security products that let it note emerging threats and push a response back out. That same system, Sullivan said, could automatically whitelist apps for Xfence, reducing the number of times a user has to respond to queries.</p>\n<p>The intent with the Xfence release is to make it part of a multi-pronged method of helping users by making smarter deductions about what normal activity is. For instance, a network firewall might take note, Sullivan said, that “we’ve never seen you connect to Bulgaria before. “Do we want to let you make that connection?” Instead of alerting about anything, outlying behavior prompts notification, removing some of the warning fatigue that otherwise kicks in.</p>\n<p>Sullivan, like many security professionals and yours truly, worries about Mac users’ attitudes about malware due to the paucity of strong attacks. But, he noted, “The Mac is more secure from turning your Mac into a bot, but if it deletes all your files, do you care that your Mac is more secure?”</p>\n<p>He says improved security across operating systems and service operators is part of what’s led to the rise of ransomware and other user-side attacks. For instance, banks have improved the detec tion of illegitimate transactions, so even if an attacker can insert themselves between a user and the bank, the bank might reject the transaction. Criminals thus shift their effort: “You can’t pick my pocket, so you extort me.”</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0109-0134/439565-1-eng-US/f0109-012.jpg\" width=\"768\" height=\"356\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0109-01\" title=\"f0109-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>Zdziarski did remarkable work as a one-man band on this app, relying on beta testers and release testers like me to provide usability and functional feedback. F-Secure has over 1,000 employees, and its developers have just started to get their hands deep into the Little Flocker codebase.</p>\n<p>Little Flocker was and Xfence now becomes the only Mac product focused prospectively on a massive malware category that’s taken in millions of people and organizations worldwide. I hope F-Secure’s attention leads to other developers— maybe even Apple—adding this kind of better file-access monitoring and control to their products.</p>\n<p>While I’ve been down on anti-virus products <a href=\"http://go.macworld.com/macmw\" target=\"_self\">in the past</a>, a comprehensive suite of network monitoring, file-access monitoring, and system change behavior tools that’s tied together for a single installation and supported with continuous updates from a company with eyes and ears around the globe would be a great boon in keeping Mac users safe.</p>\n<p>Right now, you have to install <a href=\"http://go.macworld.com/littlesnitch\" target=\"_self\">Little Snitch</a>, Xfence, and <a href=\"http://go.macworld.com/block2\" target=\"_self\">BlockBlock</a> to achieve those results.
