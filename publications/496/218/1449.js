My wife and I cut the cord many years ago, and have survived ever since on discs, downloads, streaming media, and over-the-air (OTA) programming. OTA has been a surprisingly rich source of enjoyable shows, especially from our local PBS stations and alternative standard-definition channels from network-affiliated broadcasters.</p>\n<p>One thing we’ve faced, however, is a shortage of options to record programs. Because digital video recorders (DVRs) shifted a few years ago to being mostly a commodity item offered by a programming provider like Xfinity or Dish, the market for standalone units shrunk. There are a few: <a href=\"http://go.macworld.com/tablo\" target=\"_self\">Tablo</a>, <a href=\"http://go.macworld.com/tivo\" target=\"_self\">Tivo</a>, and a couple of more niche brands.</p>\n<p>However, these standalone units record data to internal drives, and rely on apps, streaming, and other controls to give you access. Since I have a Mac that’s on all the time and has terabytes of available storage, I’d prefer keeping control in my hands, storing recordings locally on my Mac, and choosing how I time and space shift. It also gives me the option to trim out commercials before watching a movie.</p>\n<p class=\"pullQuote\">Three new systems are in various stages of beta testing, and some should be in production release soon.</p>\n<p>During 2016, macOS choices increased from one—eyeTV 3, now from Geniatech— to four. Three new systems are in various stages of beta testing, and some should be in production release soon. DVR options are now available in public beta as part of Plex Media Server, as a server component that works the Channels set of tuner apps, and from SiliconDust, makers of the HDHomeRun networked TV tuner. (The open-source MythTV is a fifth option, but it’s not for the faint of heart, and after reviewing installation instructions, I opted against testing it.)</p>\n<p>The unifying factor in all these systems in the U.S. is purchasing a networked tuner from SiliconDust, which has three current models. All the DVR software I examined supports these models; SiliconDust’s DVR offering includes support for a fourth, discontinued model.</p>\n<p>The HDHomeRun Connect ($93 <a href=\"http://go.macworld.com/hdhramz\" target=\"_self\">on Amazon</a>) and HDHomeRun Extend ($179.99 MSRP; available <a href=\"http://go.macworld.com/hdhreamz\" target=\"_self\">on Amazon</a>) versions both have two tuners, but the Connect streams high-bandwidth uncompressed video (usually in MPEG2 format), which can run 20Mbps for HD content. The Extend has built-in on-the-fly H.264 compression, which produces a dramatically smaller file. (I <a href=\"http://go.macworld.com/hdhrrev\" target=\"_self\">reviewed the Connect</a> two years ago. It’s essentially unchanged.)</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0115-0125/439615-1-eng-US/f0115-012.jpg\" width=\"571\" height=\"339\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0115-01\" title=\"f0115-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>eyeTV hasn’t changed much in years, offering a bare-bones DVR approach.</b></p>\n <span class=\"credit\">\nIMAGE: IDG</span></figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>There’s a third model too, called HDHomeRun Prime ($120 <a href=\"http://go.macworld.com/hdhrpr\" target=\"_self\">on Amazon</a>), which adds an additional tuner connected to a slot for a CableCard, an erratically supported U.S. standard that lets you use BYOB tuner/ DVR with cable service, including encrypted signals, but not those that also have DRM on top.</p>\n<p>All three versions plug into a network via 100Mbps ethernet and have a coaxial connection for an internal or external ATSC antenna, although each can also be used with subscription cable TV, from which it can handle Clear QAM (unencrypted cable) signals. When a networked app or device connects to one of the tuners, the hardware marks it as in use. You can attach multiple HDHomeRun boxes to a network if you need more than two simultaneous TV tuners.</p>\n<p>I highly recommend the Extend version, even though it costs about $80 more than Connect, because transcoding MPEG2 into any more efficient format taxes most Macs’ processors. (eyeTV is the only app that even offers transcoding via export; the rest transcode on the fly.) Hard-disk storage is cheap, but H.264 is easier to move around a network or store on an iOS device for offline watching.</p>\n<p>My longest experience on the software side is with eyeTV. I used it first with an Elgato tuner that’s no longer made, and then with an HDHomeRun Connect. (In other countries, you should have other USB or networked tuner options, and some of these software packages will work outside the U.S. with those devices.)</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0116-0135/439608-1-eng-US/f0116-012.jpg\" width=\"763\" height=\"549\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0116-01\" title=\"f0116-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>Plex has the richest programming detail.</b></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>You might be surprised as to the number of channels you can pick up in your area and what’s delivered. <a href=\"http://antennaweb.org/Address\" target=\"_self\">AntennaWeb</a> will show which channels should have available signals at your address, and the expected quality of reception. My wife and I had to put an antenna on our roof because we live in a radio shadow at the bottom of a hill on which many TV towers sit on the top out of line of sie. The roofmounted antenna lets us pick up dozens of channels, with HD reception coming through just fine.</p>\n<p>What each of the DVRs offers is a program guide; the ability to record at will or via schedules, including recurring programs; and access to your recorded programs from within a network. Some offer Internet-based remote access, live TV viewing, and native apps for iOS and Apple TV as well as other platforms.</p>\n<p>eyeTV is in commercial release. The other three I cover are in testing, so we aren’t ready to review them until they’re in release form as a server or service. Instead, I’ll provide a feature overview.</p>\n<h3><b>EYETV</b></h3><p>The €79.95 ($85) <a href=\"http://go.macworld.com/eyetvmacos\" target=\"_self\">eyeTV 3</a> macOS app is showing its age. Despite consistent updates and bug fixes, the fundamental software looks unchanged from years ago, and remains just as frustrating to use now as then.</p>\n<p>eyeTV orients itself around a programming grid, which in the U.S. requires a yearly €17.95 ($19) subscription to TV Guide. The subscription includes actors on shows and a brief description, but no show art and no links from names to find other shows they’re in. There’s no graphical way to browse or group by series, genre, or the like.</p>\n<p>The app offers a variety of ways to record via the guide. You can record an individual TV program, but if it’s part of an ongoing show, series, or the like, the app provides a button to let you record all occurrences as a Smart Guide.</p>\n<p>Smart Guides can have a number of criteria, so you can grab Saturday Night Live, no matter what network on which it appears, or only when it’s on your local NBC affiliate. You can also set up Smart Guides for actors, choose only HDTV broadcasts, or only shows with subtitles.</p>\n<p>eyeTV is a scheduler, recorder, and player all in one, and you can tune live television through it as well. The app can be reached on a local network as a server through Safari using Bonjour to view a stripped-down playback interface.</p>\n<p>There’s no Apple TV app, so the <a href=\"http://go.macworld.com/eyetvapp\" target=\"_self\">iOS app</a> ($5) is the best way to push programs to your Apple TV through AirPlay. The experience is inconsistent and miserable, unfortunately. The iOS app can connect for remote access to eyeTV in macOS if you set up a free account and have the right network configuration. (I have a “double NAT” due to my ISP’s peculiarity. While some remote-control apps can traverse that, eyeTV cannot.)</p>\n<p class=\"pullQuote\">eyeTV is a scheduler, recorder, and player all in one, and you can tune live television through it as well.</p>\n<p>Unlike the other DVRs in testing, you can transcode recordings from eyeTV to iTunes, and set that up as an automatic option after the app captures a program. The options include presets for a variety of iOS devices, Apple TV models, and HD formats, and you can customize the settings further. However, transcoding is extremely slow and can drag down the entire Mac as the app doesn’t throttle itself when burning CPU cycles.</p>\n<p>Exporting to iTunes lets you use an Apple TV to browse for computers and then bring up the converted shows. HoweyeTV ever, there’s no way to delete the recordings from within eyeTV automatically. You can opt to prune what’s been stored or otherwise manage storage. As a result, my workflow results in duplicates of everything exported, with the originals chewing up hundreds of gigabytes until I occasionally go through and delete them. Likewise, I have to delete files from iTunes if I no longer want to keep the program.</p>\n<p>eyeTV has been a marginally acceptable way for years, and it’s facing tough competition from up and comers, as I discuss next.</p>\n<h3><b>PLEX MEDIA SERVER WITH MEDIA PASS OPTION FOR DVR</b></h3><p><a href=\"https://plex.tv\" target=\"_self\">Plex</a> is a multi-platform media-organizing and sharing service that sweeps in audio, images, and video, and makes it available to desktop, mobile, and other devices, like Roku, Sony Playstation 4, and Apple TV.</p>\n<p>The free version is pretty powerful, but the company added a subscription-based option called <a href=\"https://plex.tv/features\" target=\"_self\">Plex Pass</a> that includes a host of extra features, including access to a server-based DVR. The DVR is currently in beta, but it’s listed as just another current feature on the Plex Pass page. Plex Pass costs $5 a month, $40 a year, or $120 for a lifetime pass.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0118-0130/439601-1-eng-US/f0118-012.jpg\" width=\"524\" height=\"483\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0118-01\" title=\"f0118-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>Plex allows rich searches across upcoming programming and a media library.</b></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>You view the program guide and set up recordings via the Plex Media Server in a Web browser. At present, those options aren’t available through an iOS or Apple TV app. You also can’t watch live TV: the DVR is entirely about setting up future recordings and seeing what’s scheduled. A rolling upcoming two weeks of rich programming data comes with the subscription.</p>\n<p>Instead of a programming grid, Plex approaches available programs as it does other media, showing the kinds of things you might want to see instead of focusing on where they’re located. A main Discover view mixes everything together, broken up by Starting Soon, On Right Now, New Episodes Tonight, My Upcoming Shows (meaning TV series episodes), Recommended for You, and then upcoming categories for movies, sports, and news. Plex populates My Upcoming Shows based on recordings you’ve already made, while Recommendations are drawn from the broader Plex ecosystem of media you’ve loaded.</p>\n<p>The Discover menu also lets you select Movies, News, Shows (TV series), and Sports, and then offers a custom approach to each topic. Under Shows, for instance, the default view is by series name, noting how many upcoming episodes are in the programming listing in the next two weeks. Click the show and it provides episode summaries and cast information. Click Record and Plex records all instances, with options you can choose. Or you can pick individual episodes.</p>\n<p>The search features are very rewarding, as you can pull movies by title, actor, director, words in a program description, and other details.</p>\n<p class=\"pullQuote\">While the DVR feature is still in testing at this writing, it feels close to finished and tests out well.</p>\n<p>Once you’ve picked anything to record, the Recording Schedule view shows a very very nice visualization of upcoming programs along a calendar view, which you switch to an “agenda” view that lists them in order. A Recording Priority sidebar lets you decide conflicts between overlaps with your available tuners for simultaneous programs.</p>\n<p>Among many nice touches, you can opt while setting up or revising a recording within advanced settings to Replace Lower Resolution Items. If you captured an SD version of a TV program, Plex will replace any recording in your library with an HD version if you schedule it. This can be useful for movies, especially.</p>\n<p>While the DVR feature is still in testing at this writing, it feels close to finished and tests out well. Plex including a DVR feature and programming guide as part of its larger package of features makes it a solid bargain. Plex Pass includes offline mobile access, cloud sync (to Dropbox, Google Drive, and personal OneDrive accounts), and parental controls, among other features.</p>\n","layout":{"landscape":{"id":"am-landscape-25","link":"playlist_article_main-l.twig"},"portrait":{"id":"am-portrait-25","link":"playlist_article_main.twig"}},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":0,"link_source":"","competition":[],"flatplan_title":"","notes":"","gutter_credit":"","other":"","image":[{"id":"39e20e3e1d5996223e242b0a54c3d7e3","name":"player","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/player/468847-1-eng-US/player.jpg?t=story_img_size_768x0&ext/player_story_img_size_768x0.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"1200","height":"695","legacy_id":"31605","is_default":true},{"id":"39e20e3e1d5996223e242b0a54c3d7e3","name":"player","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/player/468847-1-eng-US/player.jpg?t=story_img_size_768x0&ext/player_story_img_size_768x0.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"1200","height":"695","legacy_id":"31605","is_default":false}],"related_objects":{"image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_3_1495463868.304","name":"f0118-01","source":"","caption":"<p><b>Plex

I don’t care that much for the so-called curated lists of songs that focus on an artist, a decade, or an activity. (Specific playlists for barbecues? Or Classical Music for Elevators? Seriously?) But I do appreciate the breadth of music available on Apple Music. While I listen much more to my own large music library, I often want to sample something new on Apple Music, or simply queue up some music that might surprise me.</p>\n<p>I’ve long been a fan of Genius, the feature in iTunes that finds “songs from your library that sound great together.” This may, in fact, be the best feature in iTunes. I can pick a song, start a Genius playlist, and listen to similar music from my own collection.</p>\n<p>The equivalent on Apple Music is stations.

If you’re listening to a station on an iPhone or iPad, you can even tap the star next to songs you like to customize the station further.</p>\n<p>Unlike Genius in your iTunes library, you won’t see what’s coming up from the Up Next button. Clicking that button displays your history on the various stations you’ve created.</p>\n<p>I’ve found the variety in these stations to be interesting, yet not too far afield. For example, when I created a station based on Nils Frahm, I heard music by this artist—you generally get a song by the artist you’ve selected every four to six tracks— but also by Tim Hecker, Ólafur Arnalds, A Winged Victory for the Sullen, Hildur Godnadottir, and more. All these artists play music of a similar style or sensibility to Nils Frahm, and I also discovered a number of artists I had never heard before. You may not be familiar with these artists, but if you are, you’ll know that they all play music that does fit together. I didn’t like every track, but I just skipped the ones that weren’t to my taste.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0122-0129/439658-1-eng-US/f0122-012.jpg\" width=\"365\" height=\"192\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0122-01\" title=\"f0122-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>Click the</b> *<b>&nbsp;button next to the play/pause button in the iTunes toolbar to display a menu allowing you to tell iTunes about the current track.</b></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>In some ways, I find the limited randomness of these stations to be much more interesting than Apple Music’s curated playlists, especially for music discovery.

Each one is limited to a specific style of music, or to a certain tone. You won’t often get music from the 1970s and contemporary rock, and even jazz stations tend to limit music to within a decade or two of the seed track or album. It would be great if you could seed a station with several songs, albums, or artists.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, I find Apple Music’s personalized radio stations to be one of the most useful features. I’m not forced to listen to what some curator thinks is a good selection of songs, and I can easily change what I want to hear. Try it out and you may find that it has the right rhythm for you.</p>\n","layout":{"landscape":{"id":"am-landscape-26","link":"playlist_article_02-l.twig"},"portrait":{"id":"am-portrait-26","link":"playlist_article_02.twig"}},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":0,"link_source":"","competition":[],"flatplan_title":"","notes":"","gutter_credit":"","other":"","image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1495463873.4762","name":"f0120-01","source":"IMAGE:

\t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p><b>I</b>’ve been giving some thought to the future of iTunes and I’ve reached the conclusion that, well, it probably doesn’t have one. Sorry to be the bearer of bad news and all that.</p>\n<p>Almost two years ago, around the time Apple was rolling out Apple Music, I reasoned that it was a good opportunity to break up iTunes, <a href=\"http://go.macworld.com/newitns\" target=\"_self\">the app</a>—which, if you’re keeping score, didn’t happen. But the longer I’ve considered the matter, the more I’ve come to think that <i>the name</i> iTunes is due to ride into the sunset. And how about this for confirmation: Apple just rebranded iTunes Podcasts as <a href=\"http://go.macworld.com/apppdcst\" target=\"_self\">Apple Podcasts</a>. iTunes, your days are numbered.</p>\n<h3><b>WHAT’S IN A NAME?</b></h3><p>Starting with the release of the iMac, Apple jumped wholeheartedly on its “i” branding. But over the years, the overloaded prefix has become a liability. Originally, the i stood for internet, but in this day and age where the internet is simply part of everyday life, it looks as outdated as a Flower Power iMac. Over the years it’s not only become <a href=\"http://go.macworld.com/100prdts\" target=\"_self\">easily mocked</a>, but also adopted by plenty of other companies hoping to hitch their wagons to Apple’s brand—so much so that when Apple wanted to announce the iPhone, it had to engage in a bit of gamesmanship with Cisco, which owned the <a href=\"http://go.macworld.com/lnksphn\" target=\"_self\">iPhone trademark</a>.</p>\n<p>While Apple has not managed to entirely excise the i from its lineup—and probably won’t so long as the iPhone is around—it has tried to back away from it. Thus we get generic names products like the Apple Watch and Apple TV, as well as software like Pages, Numbers, Keynote, Clips, and so on.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0124-0135/439701-1-eng-US/f0124-012.jpg\" width=\"762\" height=\"514\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0124-01\" title=\"f0124-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n <span class=\"credit\">\nIMAGE: APPLE</span></figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>Apple relies on the strength of its overarching corporate brand to make its products stand out, even if that means that searching for them online becomes an exercise in frustration. (What do you mean you have a problem with “Mail”?)</p>\n<p>iTunes has had a good run. At one time iTunes was the generic trademark for buying music online, the Kleenex of music stores. But iTunes’ reputation isn’t all sterling. For Mac users, it’s become an amalgamated <a href=\"http://go.macworld.com/bettermusic\" target=\"_self\">beast of an application</a> that seems to never work <a href=\"http://go.macworld.com/itunesguy\" target=\"_self\">like it should</a>. For Windows users with iPhones, it’s a necessary evil (though less needed as iPhones have become more self-sufficient) and the punchline of jokes.</p>\n<p>On iOS, meanwhile, you’d be excused for blinking and missing iTunes. Sure, the iTunes Store exists, but Apple’s musicplaying app has always been a separate affair, first dubbed iPod and now simply Music. And with the introduction of Apple Music—not to mention competing music subscription services—these days “iTunes” isn’t even the logical default for getting new music on your phone. So there’s little reason for Apple to cling to the iTunes moniker on either platform.</p>\n<h3><b>TUNING OUT</b></h3><p>But if iTunes disappears, what takes its place? Well, the easiest answer is Apple Music. Apple’s already been pushing Apple Music hard as a brand, and there’s no reason to expect that to change. The company would likely dub iTunes the “Apple Music Store” to differentiate it from the subscription service. As for all the other content on the iTunes Store right now, you just have to look at the examples the company has already set to draw a straight line to Apple Movies, Apple Podcasts, and Apple TV. (Which could be confusing, come to think of it, since there’s both a set-top box and a TV app.)</p>\n<p>The biggest downside to dropping the iTunes brand is losing the instant recognition that came with it, but Apple is the world’s strongest brand, easily eclipsing all its own subbrands, so that fallout ought to be relatively limited.</p>\n<p>In the end, ditching iTunes would be positive for Apple. Moving on from a legacy brand would give the company a fresh start with users and potential customers alike. It also gets to give Apple Music some room to breathe, without the iTunes brand looking over its shoulder. Perhaps the company can even find a way to change the conversation about online music again.</p>\n<p>All of those would be welcome developments— just as long as it does something about iTunes on the Mac while it’s at it.</p>\n","layout":{"landscape":{"id":"am-landscape-26","link":"playlist_article_02-l.twig"},"portrait":{"id":"am-portrait-26","link":"playlist_article_02.twig"}},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":0,"link_source":"","competition":[],"flatplan_title":"","notes":"","gutter_credit":"","other":"","image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1495463875.4","name":"f0123-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0123-0126/439708-1-eng-US/f0123-012.jpg?t=story_img_size_768x0&ext/f0123-012_story_img_size_768x0.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"975","height":"522","legacy_id":"29411","is_default":true},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1495463875.4","name":"f0123-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0123-0126/439708-1-eng-US/f0123-012.jpg?t=story_img_size_768x0&ext/f0123-012_story_img_size_768x0.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"975","height":"522","legacy_id":"29411","is_default":false}],"related_objects":{"image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_1_1495463874.7491","name":"f0124-01","source":"IMAGE: APPLE","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0124-0135/439701-1-eng-US/f0124-012.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"762","height":"514","legacy_id":"29410"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_1_1495463874.7491","name":"f0124-01","source":"IMAGE: APPLE","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0124-0135/439701-1-eng-US/f0124-012.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"762","height":"514","legacy_id":"29410"}]},"url_alias":"http://macworld-us.audiencemedia.com","type":"story","order":"24","folio_number":"123","folio_numbers":"123,124,125","pdf_page_index":"123","thumbnail":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0123-0126/439708-1-eng-US/f0123-012.jpg?t=tablet_story_thumbnail&ext/f0123-012_tablet_story_thumbnail.jpg","color":"2699cd","real_id":"29409","main_section_id":"1449","ads":[]}],"type":null,"ads":[]}}
