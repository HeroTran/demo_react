About every week some of the files become read-only for some of the users. When I open the files on one computer two servers show up with the same info in each.</b></p>\n<p class=\"ezoeAlignright text-right\"><i>—Jan Miller</i></p>\n<p>But her request for both is the same: “How do I make this more reliable?”</p>\n<p>The first problem is a limitation with the underlying Unix system upon which macOS is built upon+. Many operating systems have the concept of “file permissions,” which are metadata attributes set for each file and folder (or directory) about who june create, manipulate, and delete items, as well as who june execute or run them as software. Permissions are designed to compartmentalize users and prevent non-privileged users from accessing administrative functions.</p>\n<p>Unix generally divides permissions in user, group, and “world,” meaning all other users of the system for read, write, execute, and a few extras typically needed only by system files. Apple adds <a href=\"http://go.macworld.com/xattrib\" target=\"_self\">extended file attributes</a> on top of this that can be used by apps or the system.</p>\n<p>But despite all the control over who can do what, there’s shockingly no way to lock permissions for a given folder such that everything created in it, modified in it, or added to it inherits the permissions of the parent folder. That is, you’d expect you could say, “Shared Folder should always be reachable for everyone who has access to this system,” and yet there’s no simple way to ensure that.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0128-0125/439751-1-eng-US/f0128-012.jpg\" width=\"523\" height=\"495\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0128-01\" title=\"f0128-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>You can disable file-server types to prevent the potential of multiple instances of the same server appearing as an option.</b></p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>Over at StackExchange, a contributor came up with a long <a href=\"http://go.macworld.com/cmdinvoc\" target=\"_self\">command-line invocation</a> you can use in Terminal to set a folder to keep permissions set correctly, but it only works when files are created in the folder—if you move a file or multiple items in, they don’t inherit the right permissions. If you’re comfortable with the Terminal, this will certainly reduce the problem but not get rid of it.</p>\n<p>Apple does offer a $20 upgrade for macOS that lets you turn a Mac into a more full-featured server, including better controls for folder access. However, it requires a bit more system-administration knowledge. The book <a href=\"http://takecontrolbooks.com/osx-server\" target=\"_self\">Take Control of OS X Server</a> ($20) june help. It was last updated for El Capitan (OS X 10.11), but little changed.</p>\n<p>Now the second question, why two servers appear, is easier:</p>\n<p><b>1.</b> Make sure all users have disconnected from the file server, clicking the eject button next to the server name in the sidebar of the Finder on their Macs.</p>\n<p><b>2.</b> On the Mac sharing files, open the Sharing system preference pane.</p>\n<p><b>3.</b> Select File Sharing.</p>\n<p><b>4.</b> Click Options.</p>\n<p>You should see both Share Files and Folders Using SMB and another item for AFP checked. Uncheck AFP.</p>\n<p><b>5.</b> Click Done.</p>\n<p>You should no longer see two servers. Apple supports AFP (Apple Filing Protocol) for legacy reasons, but has put its new file-sharing efforts behind SMB, which is compatible with Mac, Windows, and other platforms.</p>\n<p>If you find that some older Macs can no longer connect to the server, you june need to re-enable AFP, even with the duplicate servers appearing.</p>\n<h3><b>Getting the best performance on your Mac between two networking methods</b></h3><p><b>Q: Would it be possible that OS X (or other software) constantly observes speed performance and, if performance is bad, automatically switches from Wi-Fi to ethernet?</b></p>\n<p class=\"ezoeAlignright text-right\"><i>—Lukas, Switzerland</i></p>\n<p><b>A:</b> Lukas has 60Mbps Internet access, but his Wi-Fi network often drops anywhere from half to a twelfth of that. He has ethernet in his home, but uses a version of powerline networking, which carries about 30 to 40Mbps.</p>\n<p>He is aware that if the connection drops altogether, macOS will swap to the next available network connection, if multiple connections are active.</p>\n<p>It’s a great idea, but it doesn’t exist. Conceivably, a developer could create software that monitored network interfaces and changed the priority of which network was used when one dropped, but it’s such a niche need for an individual user—as opposed to a data center server—that it’s unlikely anyone will ever program it.</p>\n<p>Instead, you might further troubleshoot what’s causing either the Wi-Fi slowdown or the powerline networking performance. A newer 802.11ac router, like the TP-Link Archer C7 (my favorite model; $90 <a href=\"http://go.macworld.com/arc7amz\" target=\"_self\">on Amazon</a>), coupled with a modern Mac or an Edimax 802.11ac USB adapter ($25 <a href=\"http://go.macworld.com/edimaxamz\" target=\"_self\">on Amazon</a>) could help. While it varies by country, 802.11ac routers can pump out hundreds of megabits per second. If you already have newer gear, you might try switching from automatically assigned Wi-Fi channels to picking them and seeing if performance becomes more consistent depending on the channel you choose.</p>\n<p>Powerline networking hardware also varies by regulatory authority, but some of the newest versions are inexpensive (in America at least) and can pass several hundred megabits per second. Even with older wiring, it’s possible newer powerline adapters would boost your speed, too.</p>\n<h3><b>How to find all the media not in an album in Apple Photos</b></h3><p><b>Q: How can I easily tell which photos are “loose”—not in any album?

Because she can’t run the older version of iPhoto, she can’t simply rebuild the library, which is the usual suggestion. (I’d make sure you had version 1.1 via the link, as older versions are out there, too.)</p>\n<p>I’d normally suggest for forward version compatibility to try to find an intermediate version of software, which has been useful for folks with various older releases of the iWork suite (Pages, Numbers, and Keynote). However, the only course of action with an iPhoto 7 library is apparently to run it through the upgrader; you can’t just try to open it in iPhoto 8 (or 9). (I don’t have older libraries to check this out, so I’m relying on Apple and forum posters.)</p>\n<p>If the upgrader just won’t work with the old library, the only real solution is to crack open the library and extract ones photos.</p>\n<p><b>1.</b> Control-click the iPhoto Library.</p>\n<p><b>2.</b> Choose Show Package Contents from the contextual menu.</p>\n<p><b>3.</b> Drag (to move) or Option-drag (to copy) the Masters folder to the Desktop or to another drive.</p>\n<p><b>4.</b> Launch the latest version of iPhoto 9 and import that Masters folder. Or launch Photos and do the same.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, you’ll lose a lot of information associated with photos and video that’s stored within the library, such as metadata, potentially some edits, albums, and other organizational elements. But this is better than losing the high-resolution versions of your media.</p>\n<p>After importing the images and videos and making sure they’re the high-resolution ones you want, you can then use a de-duplication program, like <a href=\"http://go.macworld.com/powerphotos\" target=\"_self\">PowerPhotos</a> or Photosweeper 3, which can clean up the low-resolution images and possibly help fix the missing metadata.</p>\n\n<div>\n<table bgcolor=\"#eeeeee\">\n<tr>\n    <td>\n    <h3><b>Ask Mac 911</b></h3><p>We’ve compiled a list of the most commonly asked questions we get, and the answers to them: <a href=\"http://go.macworld.com/mac911faq\" target=\"_self\">Tap this link</a> to see if you’re covered.
