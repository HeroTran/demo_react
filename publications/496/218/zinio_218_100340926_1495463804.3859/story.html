    </div><h3>ELAGO M4 STAND FOR iPHONE 7</h3><p>The super-cute retro M4 Stand from <a href="http://elagostore.com" target="_self">Elago</a> ($35) is old-school: Slip your iPhone in and it becomes an old Mac monitor. While your phone is charging, you can still use it to watch movies or surf the web, and the device is made of scratch-free silicone to give your iPhone the protection it deserves. Or, pair your iPhone with a Bluetooth keyboard to make it even more Mac-like.<b>—JOEL MATHIS</b></p>

    </div><h3>EDIMAX AC1200 DUAL BAND WI-FI USB ADAPTER</h3><p>If your Mac’s Wi-Fi has failed and you’ve tried everything free, and it’s running OS X 10.7 to 10.11 or macOS Sierra, drop $20 on the <a href="http://us.edimax.com/edimax/us/" target="_self">Edimax</a> AC1200 Dual Band Wi-Fi USB Adapter and put yourself back in wireless business. This adapter doesn’t just offer any old flavor of Wi-Fi. Rather, it’s the very hippest and latest thing: it uses 802.11ac Wave 2 with MU-MIMO, which can increase throughput and help with network capacity. (Yes, those terms require some unpacking, but trust us—it’s great.) Edimax also includes beamforming, which lets an adapter and router focus more of their transmitting signal energy at each, producing a stronger (and thus often faster) connection. <b>—GLENN FLEISHMAN</b></p>

    </div><h3>AUKEY MULTIPORT USB-C HUB</h3><p>The $100 <a href="https://aukey.com" target="_self">Aukey</a> Multiport USB-C Hub brings VGA to a robust compact dock solution. It comes with a seemingly hefty price tag, but by offering a choice between HDMI and VGA while incorporating passthrough power and several other ports, the Aukey unit offers the greatest flexibility for the road-warrior presenter. You’ll still need a DVI to HDMI adapter, but that’s it. It has a brushed aluminum case and easy access to the whopping six ports on its compact frame. In addition to 4K at 30Hz HDMI support and 1080p over VGA (with capable monitors), it also includes passthrough USB-C power (no USB-C data), two USB 3.1 (5 Gbps) Type-A jacks, and gigabit Ethernet. All of these options make it an easy recommendation.<b>— GLENN FLEISHMAN</b></p>
