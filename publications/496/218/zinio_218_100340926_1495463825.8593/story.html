    </div><p><b>T</b>he <a href="https://myperi.com" target="_self">Peri Duo</a> ($190; $150 <a href="http://go.macworld.com/periamz" target="_self">on Amazon</a>) combines a protective case for iPhone 6/6s with a pair of stereo speaker grilles molded into the back for pumping up the jams without carrying around a separate Bluetooth speaker.</p>
<p>It’s a novel idea, but as you might imagine, the speakers add weight (5.4 oz) and over three-quarters of an inch of extra bulk to the device that make it less than ideal as a smartphone case.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the Duo has been designed with this dilemma in mind. Unlike many cases that require a crowbar to pry a device from its grasp, this one uses a patent-pending mechanism that slides down the Lightning connector, clearing a path for the iPhone to be inserted with ease. Slide the connector into the iPhone and it’s snugly secure in the case.</p>
<p>While powered on and attached to the case, the Lightning connection sends audio directly to the speakers for up to 15 hours of playback on a single charge. But it also taps into the case’s built-in 2,900 mAh battery, enough to charge up a completely depleted iPhone with another 20 percent in the case to spare. The case can only be recharged using the micro-USB jack on the bottom, but on the plus side, both the Duo and the attached iPhone charge simultaneously connected this way.</p>

    </div><h3><b>NO ORDINARY CASE</b></h3><p>Although the Peri Duo works best with an attached iPhone 6/6s, the case also supports Bluetooth, making it compatible with a wide range of devices for up to 20 hours of music playback at a time. Using the Mode Select button on the back of the case, I had no problem pairing with my iPhone 7 Plus, although a new model called the Duo Slim is expected this year for the latest models.</p>
<p class="pullQuote">Although the Peri Duo works best with an attached iPhone 6/6s, the case also supports Bluetooth, making it compatible with a wide range of devices for up to 20 hours of music playback at a time.</p>
<p>The Duo can be configured as an AirPlay speaker on up to five different Wi-Fi networks, allowing music to stream in higher resolution, up to 96kHz. Unfortunately, the four-watt speakers aren’t quite up to this challenge, since they only pump out a maximum volume of 100 dB. They do sound better than an iPhone 7 alone with similar stereo separation, but are no match for decent Bluetooth speakers.</p>

</div><p>Using the free Peri Audio companion app, the Quick Link feature allows up to 64 of the company’s cases to wirelessly stream the same tune. I was unable to test this feature, but it certainly sounds neat. The main limitation is that a single Duo case is rather pricey, so you’ll need friends with deep pockets to get that party started. There are four color options to choose from: White/ Silver, Red/Charcoal, Rhymesayers, and Black/Silver. Since my own iPhone 7 Plus doesn’t fit, I hijacked my wife’s iPhone 6s for testing. She was rather embarrassed being seen in public holding a bulky case with two silver speaker grilles on the back, but younger kids thought it was cool.</p>

    </div><h3><b>BOTTOM LINE</b></h3><p>The Peri Duo more than doubles the battery life of an iPhone 6/6s while providing a marginally better pair of speakers, but its versatility is mostly negated by the cost and additional bulk.</p>
