    </div><h3>CHARGE FORCE</h3><p>We’ve often praised the toughness of Otterbox’s cases for iPhone and iPad. Now they’ve teamed up with battery-maker Mophie to create Otterbox-compatible products: The <a href="http://otterbox.com" target="_self">Charge Force Battery</a> ($69.95) adds 39 hours of talk time to your phone and fits Otterbox’s uniVERSE case, while and the Charge Force Adapter ($49.95) turns the case into a wireless charging case. Now Otterbox cases can be tough and powerful.</p>

It includes a 4,000-mAh battery, can survive a two-meter drop, and is waterproof up to two meters deep. (Of course, it’s camouflaged: If you drop it in the forest, you might never find it again.)</p>

It comes with interchangeable tips to let you create precisely the writing, drawing, or painting you choose on your iPad.</p>
