From the moment the <a href=\"http://go.macworld.com/loc\" target=\"_self\">first location</a> opened its doors at Tyson’s Corner in Virginia, its main purpose was to create an environment where people could gather to talk, test, and learn about all things Apple.</p>\n<p>There were no pushy salespeople urging you to take advantage of the latest limited-time offer or time limits imposed on trying the products on display. Apple encouraged people to linger at the counters and spend a little more time at the stores, and that philosophy influenced the evolution of the store design, as software aisles gave way to casual seating and checkout lines were replaced with roving scanners.</p>\n<p>In many ways, <a href=\"http://go.macworld.com/taa\" target=\"_self\">Today at Apple</a>, which launched this past weekend at all of Apple’s 495 retail stores, is the culmination of that strategy. The program is an extension of its occasional concert and class series, and aims to make the store a regular destination for customers, with structured, continuous sessions on a variety of topics. For example, my local Providence Place Apple Store has around 20 classes each day, starting as soon as the store opens at 10 a.m. and running until it closes.</p>\n<p>Classes are <a href=\"http://go.macworld.com/cls\" target=\"_self\">extremely varied</a> and cover all of Apple’s product lines, from making music on the iPhone and iPad to navigating the Apple TV menu. There are introductory courses for new users, studio time for getting help on your latest project, and how-to sessions on apps like Numbers and GarageBand. There’s even an hourlong class on Apple Music discovery, which speaks more to Apple’s confusing design than anything.</p>\n<h3><b>SOCIAL STUDIES</b></h3><p>But while Today at Apple might seem like a ho-hum affair, the pilot program is the company’s first step in spurring growth. While Apple is hardly struggling, sales have dipped somewhat over the past few quarters, and investors and watchers alike have been waiting for the next big thing to boost the bottom line. However, while Apple is surely working on several new products that it will announce later in the year, its retail strategy is as important to its growth as the next iPhone or iPad.</p>\n<p>Case in point: Apple has been actively redesigning its stores to better highlight its classes. The new Singapore store, for example, has an entire upper floor dedicated to the Today at Apple sessions, and the iconic New York City Fifth Avenue Apple Store is in the midst of a massive redesign, which will also presumably add space for classes. Even my small mall based Apple Store received an update this past weekend, adding more open space and amenities to accommodate Today at Apple.</p>\n<p>Of course, the ultimate goal here is to increase sales, but the classes don’t seem to be specifically created around products. Some are designed for new purchasers and others actually encourage you to bring your own device to learn more about how to use it.</p>\n<p>Take Photo Walk. Offered twice daily at most stores, it could easily be an infomercial for the iPhone 7’s camera, but users can bring in any iOS device to the class. And it’s not confined to the Apple Store either. Participants will roam the grounds or the mall with the instructor, a fun concept that is sure to draw attention from passers-by. As retail chief Angela Ahrendts said when unveiling the project, “That’s the Today at Apple program, the stores become a place to experience, physically, live, everything you’ve been doing on your device.”</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0009-0128/474066-1-eng-US/f0009-012.jpg\" width=\"586\" height=\"541\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0009-01\" title=\"f0009-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>Some classes are simply showcases of talented Apple users, like movement artist and star of Apple’s AirPods commercial, Lil Buck, seen here at the Forum at Apple Union Square in San Francisco.</b></p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>CLASS-IC APPLE</b></h3><p>It’s not entirely clear how Apple is going to handle the details of the classes, however. In smaller stores like mine, it can quickly become uncomfortable on particularly crowded days. With classes all day long now, Apple might need to start limiting participation to make sure shoppers aren’t turned away, especially on days when a major speaker or artists is appearing.</p>\n<p>But Today at Apple isn’t about selling you a product. It’s about planting a seed. Even if someone doesn’t walk out of an Apple Store with a new iPhone or iPad, they’ll be more likely to remember what they learned when they are ready. I could see future classes being used to spotlight local people who have created amazing things with Apple products or kids who are just learning how to code.</p>\n<p>With more than $200 billion in annual sales and an $800 billion market cap, Apple may be the biggest company in the world, but it is still thinking small. And from small things, big things one day come.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0010-0159/474059-1-eng-US/f0010-012.jpg\" width=\"782\" height=\"586\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0010-01\" title=\"f0010-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>Sessions may feature indistry experts.

I firmly believe that great art or design can’t happen without a point of view—and the more you depart from a focused point of view, the more likely a creation will be compromised, workmanlike…good, maybe, but not great.</p>\n<p>When it’s at its best, Apple strives for greatness. It doesn’t always get there— and every now and then you get the sense it’s not actually trying to get there—but when things are hitting on all cylinders, Apple releases products that are backed by a strong point of view about what will delight and serve its customers.</p>\n<p>The MacBook, for example, is a product based on a focused vision: That a single port and a slower class of processor are worthy trade-offs for an incredibly thin and light computer with a Retina display. You don’t have to agree with Apple’s take— in the case of the MacBook, the company’s practically daring you to disagree—but you can’t deny that it’s an amazing execution of a particular set of priorities.</p>\n<p>I’ve been thinking about Apple’s approach to products this week because I read Steven Levy’s excellent inside look at the new <a href=\"http://go.macworld.com/apc\" target=\"_self\">Apple Park campus</a> for Wired. It’s worth a read—I highly recommend it, if you haven’t dug in yet.</p>\n<p>Levy’s been covering Apple longer than just about anyone, and in great detail. In his story about Apple Park, he suggests that the facility itself is an Apple product— in fact, the last product to truly be conceived of by Steve Jobs. (It’s why the story’s headline, “One More Thing,” is so bittersweet.)</p>\n<p>Here’s a key section:</p>\n<p><i>Apple Park is the architectural avatar of the man who envisioned it, the same man who pushed employees to produce those signature products. In the absence of his rigor and clarity, he left behind a headquarters that embodies both his autobiography and</i><i>his values. The phrase that keeps coming up in talks with key Apple figures is “Steve’s gift.”... The current leaders of Apple are determined not to disappoint him in what is arguably his biggest, and is certainly his last, product launch. “I revere him,” Cook says. “And this was clearly his vision, his concept. Our biggest project ever.”</i></p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0012-0157/474116-1-eng-US/f0012-012.jpg\" width=\"449\" height=\"466\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0012-01\" title=\"f0012-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>As detailed by Levy, Apple Park is an Apple product through and through. The company took great care to make design decisions, and create custom hardware, at many key points—from the massive glass sheets that required the building of a gigantic furnace, to the toilets, to the handles on the doors, to the pizza boxes in the cafeteria. It’s a one-off product designed by Apple for itself, yes, but it seems to have received the same attention to detail as any other major product launch.</p>\n<p>(In fact, reading Levy’s story, I wondered to myself if some of Apple’s product sluggishness over the last couple of years might be somehow related to the design energy going into the new campus. Probably not, but you never know. I’m more concerned about the hit in productivity the company may experience when it has to move so many of its employees to new workspaces and allow them some time to adapt to their surroundings.)</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0013-0162/474109-1-eng-US/f0013-012.jpg\" width=\"920\" height=\"669\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0013-01\" title=\"f0013-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>In the end, Apple’s choices about the materials used in construction and the hardware adorning Apple Park aren’t that important (unless you work there). What does fascinate me is one bit of criticism leveled at the plan, which says a lot about Steve Jobs’s vision for Apple and how it conflicts with the approaches many other tech companies are making:</p>\n<p><i>[There are critiques] that the campus is a snobby isolated preserve, at odds</i><i>with the trendy urbanist school of corporate headquarters. (Amazon, Twitter, and Airbnb are all part of a movement that hopes to integrate tech employees into cities as opposed to having them commute via fuel-gobbling cars or numbing Wi-Fi-equipped buses.) That the layout of the Ring is too rigid... That there is no childcare center. “It’s an obsolete model that doesn’t address the work conditions of the future,” says Louise Mozingo, an urban design professor at UC Berkeley.</i></p>\n<p>Steve Jobs’s vision for Apple’s headquarters was to stay close to home, in the low-density suburbs that form Silicon Valley, rather than embrace a more high-density, urban environment. Apple’s never been a city company, from its very start in that suburban garage. Using that as a given—Apple’s a company that isn’t going to stray too far from its suburban roots—Jobs envisioned a hub of activity surrounded by a tranquil park of hills and trees that are reminiscent of the area when it was mostly fruit trees and fields, before it became a major hub of American innovation.</p>\n<p>Apple’s decision to make Apple Park a ring will be a convenient metaphor for those who wish to criticize the company for being secretive, insular, and arrogant— Levy quotes one critic who calls it a “retrograde cocoon.” There will be more, and worse, when the campus opens and in the years thereafter.</p>\n<p>Take those criticisms as you will, but anyone who’s visited Apple’s Infinite Loop campus—constructed in 1992-93—will tell you that Apple’s been buildings set in a ring with a large private space in the center for 25 years. Building oases in the middle of South Bay suburbs—this is in Apple’s DNA.</p>\n<p class=\"pullQuote\">Steve Jobs’s vision for Apple’s headquarters was to stay close to home, in the low-density suburbs that form Silicon Valley, rather than embrace a more high-density, urban environment.</p>\n<p>Sometimes you need to be true to yourself. I think it’s fair for Levy to note that Apple is not doing what some other major tech companies are doing, and integrating their campuses into urban environments. I was in Seattle recently and got to go past Amazon’s biosphere, where many large office buildings devoted to Amazon are integrated with a weird set of domes and a bustling urban area with shops and restaurants. Twitter moved onto Market Street in San Francisco, and startups have thrived in San Francisco’s South of Market area for years.</p>\n<p>There’s a lot to be said for embracing urban areas, rather than hiding in the suburbs. From a commuting perspective, the suburban office park is terrible. Apple’s campuses, old and new, are poorly served by public transit, leading the company to create a parallel transit system of fancy Wi-Fi–equipped buses. City centers are, in contrast, generally served well by regional transportation systems.</p>\n<p>A friend of mine recently got a job at Google and was wondering which would be better for her commute-wise—the horror stories of how expensive it is to live in San Francisco (Google has an office building just north of the Bay Bridge) made her assume that the suburban Mountain View campus would be preferable. I had to explain that San Francisco was actually a better location, because it’s served by the regional BART train system as well as ferries from across the bay.</p>\n<p>It’s hard to imagine Apple colonizing downtown San Francisco, just as it’s hard to imagine Google building its new campus in high-rises in San Jose. I can’t imagine Microsoft decamping from its suburban campus in Redmond, either. Then again, Adobe—who previously occupied what is now the center of the Googleplex—did decamp to new high-rise buildings in San Jose.</p>\n<p>In the long run, I think it’s a mistake for big companies to build sprawling suburban headquarters in areas poorly served by public transportation. I applaud Twitter and Amazon’s embracing of the urban center. (And Google’s decision to include child care centers in its facilities plans, unlike Apple and Microsoft.)</p>\n<p>But I understand why building outside of the suburbs was never really a serious option for Apple—or its Seattle cousin Microsoft. Like their cofounders Steve Jobs and Bill Gates, they’re suburban kids who never seem to have really gotten a taste for the big city.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n

world of coding to kids (and adults) who thought just the idea of creating an app was intimidating. Swift Playgrounds makes coding approachable and fun to learn, combining tutorials, a touch interface, and “challenges” on an iPad that anyone can use for free.</p>\n<p>While Swift Playgrounds can be a very satisfying experience that results in your very own app, technology moves forward—we’re now in a world where drones and robots are prevalent. With that in mind, Apple recently announced Swift Playgrounds version 1.5, which includes tools that teach students how to control drones and robots over Bluetooth using an iPad.</p>\n<p>The new program gives teachers access to Swift Playgrounds curriculum that works with a number of robots and drones, including products from Lego, Parrot, Sphero, Ubtech Robotics, and Wonder Workshop. Since Swift is an open-source language, Apple says that makes it easy for other companies to jump on the bandwagon.</p>\n<p>The addition of drone and robot support expands Swift Playgrounds’ content library, and the direct results experienced by students can be satisfying and help maintain interest in coding. “Kids know the difference between writing something that’s real and writing something that’s not real,” said Cheryl Thomas, Apple VP of Engineering, Swift Playgrounds, during a press event.</p>\n<p>Since June 5 (the first day of Apple’s 2017 Worldwide Developers Conference), educators have been able to access the new Swift Playgrounds 1.5 as a free download in the App Store. The app requires iOS 10 or later, and can run on all iPad Air and iPad Pro models, as well as the iPad mini 2. Support is provided through Apple’s <a href=\"https://apple.co/liVvm7R\" target=\"_self\">Education program</a>, which includes Professional Learning Specialists to help with the lessons.</p>\n<p>Since its introduction in 2014, Swift has been embraced by software developers. Apple said that over 250,000 apps have been created using Swift. The company is also excited by Swift Playgrounds; at the version 1.5 event, Apple representatives said that over a million unique users have used the learning software.</p>\n<p>The Swift Playgrounds 1.5 announcement came about a week after Apple released <a href=\"http://go.macworld.com/aad\" target=\"_self\">App Development with Swift</a>, a year-long curriculum for educators interested in teaching Swift software development. The curriculum is available for free in the <a href=\"https://itunes.com/ecc/\" target=\"_self\">iTunes Store</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"pullQuote\">The new program gives teachers access to Swift Playgrounds curriculum that works with a number of robots and drones, including products from Lego, Parrot, Sphero, Ubtech Robotics, and Wonder Workshop.</p>\n","layout":{"landscape":{"id":"am-landscape-14","link":"macuser_article_02-l.twig"},"portrait":{"id":"am-portrait-14","link":"macuser_article_02.twig"}},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":1,"link_source":"","competition":[],"flatplan_title":"","notes":"","gutter_credit":"","other":"","image":[{"id":"16458e9c84fb76f4f5eb78447ff40114","name":"swift","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/swift/477348-1-eng-US/swift.jpg?t=story_img_size_768x0&ext/swift_story_img_size_768x0.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"1350","height":"800","legacy_id":"32117","is_default":true},{"id":"16458e9c84fb76f4f5eb78447ff40114","name":"swift","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/swift/477348-1-eng-US/swift.jpg?t=story_img_size_768x0&ext/swift_story_img_size_768x0.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"1350","height":"800","legacy_id":"32117","is_default":false}],"related_objects":{"image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1497545462.1383","name":"f0016-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0016-0161/474152-1-eng-US/f0016-012.jpg?t=story_img_size_768x0&ext/f0016-012_story_img_size_768x0.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"777","height":"575","legacy_id":"31821"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1497545462.1383","name":"f0016-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0016-0161/474152-1-eng-US/f0016-012.jpg?t=story_img_size_768x0&ext/f0016-012_story_img_size_768x0.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"777","height":"575","legacy_id":"31821"}]},"url_alias":"http://macworld-us.audiencemedia.com","type":"story","order":"2","folio_number":"16","folio_numbers":"16,17","pdf_page_index":"16","thumbnail":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/swift/477348-1-eng-US/swift.jpg?t=tablet_story_thumbnail&ext/swift_tablet_story_thumbnail.jpg","color":"2699cd","real_id":"31820","main_section_id":"1727","ads":[]},{"id":"zinio_285_100340926_1497545463.2022","title":"GAEMS M155 PERFORMANCE MONITOR: PORTABLE DISPLAY SHOWS ITS PROMISE—AND FAULTS","sub_title":"Review | M155 Performance Monitor","author":[{"id":"0","name":"SÉAMUS BELLAMY","email":"noreply@audiencemedia.com","is_default":false}],"tag":"","strap_line":"DISPLAY","intro":"The Latest Mac Products Reviewed & Rated","body":"<p class=\"byline\"><b>BY SÉAMUS BELLAMY</b></p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0019-0143/474202-1-eng-US/f0019-012.jpg\" width=\"753\" height=\"460\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0019-01\" title=\"f0019-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n <span class=\"credit\">\nIMAGE: GAEMS</span></figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p><b>H</b>aving a TV at home to watch movies or play some console games on a rainy day is a huge win, especially if you have kids to entertain. And while rocking an ultraportable device like an 9.7-inch iPad Pro or a 12-inch MacBook might make your load lighter for business travel, the small dimensions of their displays make them less than ideal for multitasking when the time comes to get some serious work done.</p>\n<p>A great solution to both of these scenarios is to invest in a portable monitor that offers a high-enough resolution to allow it to be used for watching movies and gaming, yet is still compact and light enough to be packed up and tossed in a carry-on bag.</p>\n<p>Sound good? Then you might like the Gaems M155 <a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/yc4bp3hn\" target=\"_self\">Performance Gaming Monitor</a>. While it was designed as a mobile display for hard-core gamers to drag along to LAN parties, for the rest of us, the M155 is a reasonably priced, lightweight HDMI-capable jack-of-all-video-trades.</p>\n<p>The first thing you’ll find if you commit to a web search for the M155, is that there’s two versions of this thing out there: an older model with poorly placed ports, a rickety build quality, and no audio, save what a 3.5mm port could afford. The new version of the M155 corrects all of these problems and improves upon the original’s design in a number of other ways that make it a very desirable product to get your meat hooks on.</p>\n<p>Featuring a 15.5-inch 720p (1080p scaled) display, the M155 is designed to connect to any HDMI-enabled device. Have an Apple TV? Plug it in. Want to hook up an iPad to do some typing on a larger screen or to rock a second display with your MacBook? Pack the appropriate dongle and get down to it.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0020-0169/474195-1-eng-US/f0020-012.jpg\" width=\"484\" height=\"438\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0020-01\" title=\"f0020-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>In addition to its built-in controls, the M155 comes with an IR remote.</b></p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>As the M155 weighs just under two pounds and comes with a neoprene sleeve to keep it safe in transport, you’ll never have regrets about bringing it along with you. Gaems sells the M155 as a pricey package deal with a sturdy backpack designed to carry the display and the gaming console of your choice. But you likely don’t need it. If your bag is large enough to stow a 15-inch MacBook Pro in it, it’ll likely work just as well for stashing the M155 in it.</p>\n<p>Setting up the M155 to use couldn’t be easier. Simply remove it from its slipcase, push its integrated rubber feet into position, and plug it in. You won’t find any ugly wall warts here: the display can be powered with nothing more than a USB cable and a mobile phone power adapter. As you likely already carry both of these items with you when you travel, that’s a slam dunk.</p>\n<p>With the juice flowing, next, plug one end of an HDMI cable into the M155 and the other into a compatible device or dongle. You’re ready to enjoy video with a 16:9 aspect ratio, play games, or get a bit of typing done.</p>\n<p>Out of the box, I found that the M155’s colors were a little more saturated than I cared for. I was quickly able to correct this issue using the display’s included IR remote. Through the M155’s menu interface, it’s possible to change color, contrast, and lighting levels, as well as tweak the audio coming from the display’s adequate (but underwhelming) speaker. To customize video and audio, you can rely on a handful of presets or delve into the nitty-gritty of granular adjustments—a welcome surprise from a relatively cheap display.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0021-0149/474188-1-eng-US/f0021-012.jpg\" width=\"924\" height=\"581\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0021-01\" title=\"f0021-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>Even Iron Man can’t protect the M155’s glossy display from glare, dust and fingerprints.</b></p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>One issue that I wasn’t able to correct was the M155’s lousy viewing angles. Unless you’re seated directly in front of the display, you’re not going to see much. Its visibility issues are compounded by the display’s high-gloss finish, which acts as a fingerprint and dust magnet. Even while watching it in overcast conditions, I found that I had to position myself, just so, in order to avoid seeing myself and light from my home’s windows reflected back at me. That’s frustrating.</p>\n<p class=\"pullQuote\">With it attached to my PS4, I found that the M155 didn’t drop a single frame during a Fallout 4 marathon. Watching movies on my third-generation Apple TV or iPad Pro proved just as buttery smooth.</p>\n<p>Once you get it set up to meet your expectations for satisfactory video levels, sounding right, and not reflecting the full fury of the sun into your eyeholes, however, the M155 affords a pretty decent viewing experience.</p>\n<p>With it attached to my PS4, I found that the M155 didn’t drop a single frame during a <i>Fallout 4</i> marathon. Watching movies on my third-generation Apple TV or iPad Pro proved just as buttery smooth.</p>\n<p>That said, I found that using it as a second display for my 13-inch MacBook Pro with Retina Display was less impressive. Text appeared a little bit fuzzy. But that’s something I’ve run into with other displays with similar specs to the M155 in the past—and honestly, when you’re comparing the Retina display of a $2,700 computer against that of a sub-$200 piece of hardware, you’ve got to expect to be underwhelmed. So, maybe use it for displaying your calendar, Omnifocus to-do list, and Twitter feed, but avoid using it for photo processing or typing out a lengthy document.</p>\n<h3><b>BOTTOM LINE</b></h3><p>Easy to set up, feature-packed and at a reasonable price point, the Gaems M155 Performance Monitor should have been easy for me to like. But its poor viewing angles, screen glare and propensity for showing off every fingerprint smudge and piece of dust that falls on it left me willing to recommend it, but with a few reservations.</p>\n\n<div>\n<table bgcolor=\"#eeeeee\">\n<tr>\n    <td>\n    <h3><b>GAEMS M155</b></h3>\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/3.5mice20/475927-1-eng-US/3.5mice.png\" width=\"271\" height=\"144\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"3.5mice\" title=\"3.5mice\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h4><b>AT A GLANCE</b></h4><p>There’s a lot to like about the Satechi Slim Aluminum Type-C Multi-Port Adapter.

After all, wires can be severed or simply unplugged, disabling a camera before it ever has a chance to catch a glimpse of potential intruders.</p>\n<p>Although Wi-Fi allows cameras to have one less tether, manufacturers mostly disregard the real elephant in the room— until now. The folks at Reolink have introduced the world’s first battery-powered security camera, offering the freedom to move it anywhere around the home.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/sensor/477355-1-eng-US/sensor.jpg\" width=\"508\" height=\"471\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"sensor\" title=\"sensor\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>CUT THE CORD</b></h3><p>Reolink Keen (<a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/ych3at9f\" target=\"_self\">$130</a>) is a security camera powered entirely by four included CR123A batteries, powerful 3.0-volt cells typically reserved for photo accessories. There’s no AC power option, so you’ll want to keep a backup supply of these less common batteries on hand. Under normal conditions, a set of these batteries can power Keen for up to six months in standby mode.</p>\n<p>Roughly five inches tall and four inches wide, the all-black Keen resembles a small Russian nesting doll, thanks to its rounded top with speaker grilles on each side of the head that look a bit like ears. The camera lens view is 90 degrees wide, but the upper half of the body rotates, allowing the camera to pan 355 degrees horizontally or tilt 105 degrees vertically.</p>\n<p>A pair of antennae protrude from the back, capable of picking up available 2.4GHz 802.11b/g/n Wi-Fi signals. Aside from the silver ring around the middle and the blue Reolink logo on the base, Keen is unobtrusive enough to fit into any environment, and the wireless portability makes it easy to relocate as needed; the box also includes everything needed for wall mounting.</p>\n<p>Setup takes only minutes and is ingeniously simple: Install the free Reolink app on your iPhone or Android smartphone, tap Add New Device, and scan the barcode sticker on back. Keen uses voice prompts for entering wireless network credentials, then the app generates a QR code to pair the camera.</p>\n<h3><b>MOBILE SECURITY</b></h3><p>Reolink Keen offers three H.264 compression quality options: Fluent, Balanced, and Clear, with the latter offering the clearest maximum image resolution of 1920x1080 at a frame rate of 15 fps. Picture quality is good, and there’s a built-in microphone just below the camera lens that allows two-way communication</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0025-0152/474238-1-eng-US/f0025-012.jpg\" width=\"656\" height=\"438\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0025-01\" title=\"f0025-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>While Keen was designed for smartphone use, the hardware works to a lesser extent with Reolink Client for Mac or Windows. The software’s automatic search fails to find Keen on your wireless network, but I could add the camera by manually entering its device UID from the QR sticker. Keen doesn’t work with web browsers, so you won’t be able to log in remotely without an app.</p>\n<p>I was disappointed to discover recordings manually initiated on the iPhone don’t keep going in the background, instead terminating when the app is closed. This is an odd limitation considering the camera features a micro-SD slot (card not included) for up to 64GB worth of recordings, and makes it less useful for keeping tabs on kids or pets left home alone since you can’t start recording as you leave.</p>\n<p>Reolink includes a PIR motion sensor, which uses infrared to detect human or animal movement within 26 feet. You can set up the Keen to automatically record when there’s activity, optionally accompanied by email, push notification, or voice alerts. The motion sensor is a welcome addition, because it’s less prone to being triggered by noninfrared objects like tree limbs or blowing leaves.</p>\n<h3><b>BOTTOM LINE</b></h3><p>If you’re in the market for a home security camera designed with smartphone users in mind, the Reolink Keen is an affordable and easy-touse solution that offers true wireless freedom.</p>\n\n<div>\n<table

href=\"http://tinyurl.com/y9geltzk\" target=\"_self\">App Store</a>) is the spiritual, but not direct, sequel to Black Isle’s critically-acclaimed CRPG legend <i>Planescape: Torment,</i> which, as geeks of a certain age will tell you (pushes up glasses), was based on a campaign setting for the pencil and paper iteration of Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons. A text-driven masterpiece, <i>Planescape: Torment</i> shunned the combat-heavy gameplay that most folks associate with mainstream video games. Instead, players talked their party of digital adventurers out of trouble and down new avenues of the game’s complex story. The decisions you made in <i>Planescape: Torment,</i> mattered.</p>\n<p><i>Torment: Tides of Numenera</i>? It’s got all of this going on too.</p>\n<h3><b>WHAT’S IT ABOUT?</b></h3><p>In the game, players take on the role of The Last Castoff, the discarded avatar of an immortal scientist-cum-wizard called The Changing God. There’s been many castoffs over the centuries, created by The Changing God to hold his consciousness as he runs from and works to defeat a seemingly unstoppable enemy called The Sorrow. Over the course of the game, you’ll be faced by <i>Torment: Tides of Numenera’</i>s central theme: what’s the worth of a single life?</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0027-0142/474295-1-eng-US/f0027-012.jpg\" width=\"706\" height=\"442\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0027-01\" title=\"f0027-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>Like any good role</b>?playing<b> game, the type of character you crate will dictate the kind of story you’ll be a part of.</b></p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>From your character’s standpoint, it’s a good question: The Last Castoff is functionally immortal. No matter whether you’re taken out by misadventure or intentionally snuffing it to gain a new insight that’ll drive the plot forward, you’ll keep on coming back for more. The companions The Last Castoff gathers to his cause over the course of the game, however, are merely mortal. If they die, their deaths can have consequences for your story further down the road. This makes for some interesting gameplay. You can risk or sacrifice your life, and at times, do the same to the other members of your party. Doing the latter may allow you to push The Last Castoff’s story forward, but could hobble your characters in other ways down the line.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0028-0163/474288-1-eng-US/f0028-012.jpg\" width=\"762\" height=\"477\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0028-01\" title=\"f0028-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>The combat in Torment: is limited, but what there is of it, feels intense.</b></p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>GAMEPLAY</b></h3><p>To play <i>Torment: Tides of Numenera,</i> you must do a lot of reading. Quest largely lines are forwarded and resolved in text and through the use of character attributes like strength, intellect, and speed. The higher the artiste, the better the chance for success.</p>\n<p>So too goes the game’s rare instances of turn-based combat. You’ll do battle armed with characters relying on a miscellany of spells, single-use artifacts, projectile weapons, and old fashion blades. While it can’t hold a candle to the topdrawer gameplay mechanics of <i>XCOM 2,</i> the turn-based combat in <i>Tides of Numenera</i> is tense. I always felt like I’d accomplished something when my party came out the other side of a violent encounter in one piece. Much of this tension comes from the fact that the stakes in the game are high: the death of your party means never being able to uncover the final chapter in The Last Castoff’s story. With writing of the calibre we’re treated to in <i>Torment: Tides of Numenera,</i> such an outcome is almost unthinkable.</p>\n<h3><b>COMPLAINTS</b></h3><p>I was able to complete all of the game’s side quests and main story line in around 40 hours. That’s a respectable amount of gameplay. However, I found that <i>Torment:</i><i>Tides of Numenera</i> isn’t a terribly replayable title. Even if you create a character with a completely different skillset and make different choices throughout the game, you won’t find much variety here. Having been so spoiled by open-ended games for so long, some players may not be thrilled by this. I’d argue that it’s better to be told a good story once than be subjected to a gazillion mediocre tales. But that’s me.</p>\n<p class=\"pullQuote\">In <i>Tides of Numenera’</i>s starting area, for example, is a village composed of buildings that have stood for a millennia and technology so advanced that it could be mistaken for magic.</p>\n<p>Then there’s the game world. It’s beautifully painted environments, while varied, feel limited. In <i>Tides of Numenera’</i>s starting area, for example, is a village composed of buildings that have stood for a millennia and technology so advanced that it could be mistaken for magic. There are mutants, shunned by many, headless tradesmen, airships destined for far off lands, and a police force composed of police officers made from the energy of other people’s lives. It’s amazing world-building.</p>\n<p>But at times, it feels static. With few exceptions, the option to interact with the denizens of <i>Torment: Tides of Numenera</i>are limited to dealing with merchants, and speaking to NPCs as part of a quest. For a game that is driven by text, instead of pricey voice talent, that’s disappointing. I’m not asking that every NPC on the street have a complete backstory, but a little more depth would definitely have added to the game’s immersion for me.</p>\n<h3><b>BOTTOM LINE</b></h3><p>Despite its shortcomings, T<i>orment: Tides of Numenera</i> is an excellent game, for a particular kind of gamer. If you’re looking for twitch-based gameplay, instant gratification, and a bit of mindless violence, look elsewhere. On the other hand, if you value story, worldbuilding, intrigue, and have the attention span required to see the game’s 40 hours of gameplay through to the end, don’t hesitate—download it from Steam or the Mac App Store immediately. There’s few CRPGs that can match it.</p>\n\n<div>\n<table bgcolor=\"#eeeeee\">\n<tr>\n    <td>\n    <h3><b>TORMENT: TIDES OF NUMENERA</b></h3>\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n

href=\"http://tinyurl.com/y7nmz6jx\" target=\"_self\">$36</a>) packs a lot of ports and desirable features into a handsome, robust small package that is also modestly priced. The hub includes 4K HDMI, three USB 3.0 (5 Gbps) Type-A ports, SD and microSD slots, and passthrough power. The USB-C port can’t be used for data transfer.</p>\n<p>It lacks a bit on the power front, which could affect your purchase depending on what you need to do with a hub or a dock. You can only plug in a single hard drive to the hub, and the entire hub maxes out at 900 milliamps (mA), which translates to 4.5 watts, whether for bus-powered devices or recharging an iPhone or other hardware. That might not be enough, but in such a compact space and at such a low price, that’s one of the trade-offs.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0031-0153/474338-1-eng-US/f0031-012.jpg\" width=\"555\" height=\"549\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0031-01\" title=\"f0031-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>The model I tested had very tight tolerances on its USB-C port, making it a little hard initially to insert cables. The integral 5-inch USB-C jack (including the connector) is reinforced and snicks nicely into a 12-inch MacBook’s port. I don’t love integral connectors, because they can be bent or damaged in transit, and then the entire unit has to be repaired or replaced. But Dodocool has tried hard to make its connector resilient, not to mention it’s also easy to lose a removable USB-C cable—and a pain to replace one that supports highwattage power passthrough.</p>\n<p>In testing, the hub performed as expected with external video, passing through DisplayPort over HDMI to a 4K monitor with smoothly streaming playback, and had the same throughput rates and consistency as the best of other docks with a USB 3.0 SSD drive and SD and microSD (TransFlash or TF) cards. Although the manual isn’t explicit, you can only use one card type at a time. (The manual notes you can use SD or TF cards, but not that you can only use either at once.)</p>\n<h3><b>BOTTOM LINE</b></h3><p>Some travelers and desktop users might need gigabit ethernet, VGA, more bus power, or a 10 Gbps USB 3.1 Gen 2 port, but I expect most people will find the Dodocool the right mix of features and price tag.</p>\n\n<div>\n<table bgcolor=\"#eeeeee\">\n<tr>\n    <td>\n

target=\"_self\">nike.com</a></p>\n<p>Apple’s collaboration with Nike has already produced a popular, breathable band for the Apple Watch, and now that same band style is available in several different colors. The $49 Day to Night collection is made up of bands that are, “inspired by a shade of the sky,” according to Nike. The four bands are available in colors that match the four colorways of the Air VaporMax Flyknit running shoe, in various shades of blue and purple. While Nike says that the new bands are for Apple Watch Nike+, there’s nothing about the new Day to Night bands that add functionality to the watch—you can pick one up regardless of the model of your Apple Watch.<b>—ROMAN LOYOLA</b></p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0033-0142/474381-1-eng-US/f0033-012.jpg\" width=\"975\" height=\"577\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0033-01\" title=\"f0033-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>WATERFIELD DESIGNS iPAD PRO GEAR CASE</b></h3><p><a href=\"http://sfbags.com\" target=\"_self\">sfbags.com</a></p>\n<p>Now that there’s a new iPad Pro on the market, you might find yourself with more gear to schlep around than usual.
