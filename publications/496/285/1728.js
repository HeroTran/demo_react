Well, that depends on how you plan to use your iPhone’s voice assistant. While Google has made great strides in artificial intelligence, Siri has the perks of being seamlessly integrated into iOS, like waking her up by long-pressing the Home button or hands free by calling out “Hey Siri.”</p>\n<p>We tested Google Assistant and Siri by asking them to tap into third-party services and to conduct some complex web searches. Here’s where each voice assistant excelled.</p>\n<h3><b>‘TURN OFF WIFI’</b></h3><p><b>WINNER:</b> SIRI</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0038-0168/474480-1-eng-US/f0038-012.jpg\" width=\"787\" height=\"696\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0038-01\" title=\"f0038-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>Here’s where Siri’s home-field advantage comes in. Using Siri, you can change a lot of the iPhone’s basic functions and settings. For example, Siri can turn Wi-Fi on or off. And if you ask her to “take a selfie,” Siri will launch the camera app and automatically switch it to the front-facing viewfinder. You can also open any of your installed apps using Siri, even Google Assistant. In addition, you can use Siri to search the App Store. That makes it really easy to find a new app you’re looking for.</p>\n<h3><b>‘NAVIGATE TO WORK’</b></h3><p><b>WINNER:</b> TIE</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0039-0152/474473-1-eng-US/f0039-012.jpg\" width=\"683\" height=\"603\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0039-01\" title=\"f0039-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>Both Siri and Google Assistant were very competent in fulfilling basic requests. During our test, both voice assistants were able to give us directions to “work,” show us photos of our pets, make phone calls, and send emails and texts. Of course, Siri completed all these tasks using the iPhone’s native apps, while Google Assitant tapped into Google Maps, Google Photos, and Gmail. So, the best assistant in this category will most likely depend on whether you’re using the default iPhone apps or opted to use Google’s suite of apps instead.</p>\n<h3><b>‘REMIND ME I HAVE A CALL AT ONE’</b></h3><p><b>WINNER:</b> GOOGLE ASSISTANT</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0040-0167/474466-1-eng-US/f0040-012.jpg\" width=\"378\" height=\"331\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0040-01\" title=\"f0040-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>One of the best uses for our phone assistants is reminders. With Siri, you can ask to set a reminder to make a call at 1, and it will oblige. The same is true with Google Assistant (though it’ll work through your Google account, not the Reminders app). However, Assistant gives you much more control. Because of its conversational nature, you can say “Make that 12:30,” or “Change the title to Conference call,” and it will tweak it until it’s right. Siri won’t know that you’re talking about the same task and will offer to start a new one.</p>\n<h3><b>“PLAY ‘TOXIC’ BY BRITNEY SPEARS”</b></h3><p><b>WINNER:</b> SIRI</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0040-0229/474452-1-eng-US/f0040-022.jpg\" width=\"561\" height=\"496\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0040-02\" title=\"f0040-02\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>Google Assistant can actually access Apple Music, but it’s a hit or miss. When I asked it to play “Toxic” by Britney Spears, it started playing a karaoke version. I asked several times, actually, and every time Google Assistant surfaced yet another weird version, from lullabies to random remixes. Siri, on the other hand, seemed to have read my mind and started playing the original version on the first try. Google Assistant was also unable to play the correct Apple Music playlist, and it can’t tap into Shazam to identify songs.</p>\n<h3><b>‘FIND THE CHEAPEST FLIGHT TO PALM SPRINGS IN OCTOBER’</b></h3><p><b>WINNER:</b> GOOGLE ASSISTANT</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0041-0155/474459-1-eng-US/f0041-012.jpg\" width=\"445\" height=\"388\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0041-01\" title=\"f0041-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>Unsurprisingly, Google Assistant really excelled at performing complex web searches. When I asked it to find me the cheapest flight to Palm Springs in October, I got all the information almost instantly without having to leave the app. Google Assistant was even able to tell me the duration of each flight. Meanwhile, Siri defaulted to a basic web search using Bing that did not give me nearly as much detail right away.</p>\n<h3><b>‘HOW DO YOU MAKE GRILLED CHEESE?’</b></h3><p><b>WINNER:</b> GOOGLE ASSISTANT</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0041-034/474438-1-eng-US/f0041-032.jpg\" width=\"565\" height=\"497\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0041-03\" title=\"f0041-03\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>Google Home recently gained the ability to offer step-by-step instructions for making millions of dishes, but even the rudimentary recipe search is better on Google Assistant. If you say, “Let’s make grilled cheese,” for example, it will provide a list of recipes to choose from, and offer instructions for the one you select. Siri isn’t quite so helpful. If you ask it the same question, it will search for restaurants that specialize in grilled cheese, and even if you ask, “How do you make grilled cheese?” it will merely take you to the Wikipedia page.</p>\n<h3><b>‘MAKE A RESERVATION AT A RESTAURANT’</b></h3><p><b>WINNER:</b> SIRI</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0041-0215/474445-1-eng-US/f0041-022.jpg\" width=\"189\" height=\"330\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0041-02\" title=\"f0041-02\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>When I asked Google Assistant to make a restaurant reservation, it defaulted to pulling information from the top web search result. It was disappointing, no doubt, and pretty ironic that the web page was a how-to on making restaurant reservations via Siri. So, when I tried the same query on Siri, the voice assistant followed up asking for a date and time and then gave me a list of nearby restaurants with availability using the OpenTable app.</p>\n<h3><b>‘SHOW ME THE LATEST SPIDER-MAN TRAILER’</b></h3><p><b>WINNER:</b> GOOGLE ASSISTANT</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0042-0164/474431-1-eng-US/f0042-012.jpg\" width=\"787\" height=\"608\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0042-01\" title=\"f0042-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>If you ask to “play the latest Spider-Man trailer,” Google Assistant will automatically provide the expanded YouTube link, ready to play right in the app. Siri, on the other hand, will understand that you want to play a Spider-Man trailer, but it will make you select from a lengthy list before it begins playing. But when I selected Homecoming from the list, it didn’t bring up the trailer. It told me that it didn’t see any movies matching it.</p>\n<h3><b>‘WHO HAS THE MOST HOMERUNS THIS SEASON?’</b></h3><p><b>WINNER:</b> SIRI</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0043-0150/474424-1-eng-US/f0043-012.jpg\" width=\"278\" height=\"499\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0043-01\" title=\"f0043-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>AI chatbots are great for telling you the score of a baseball or basketball game, and both assistants do a fine job of answering, “What’s the score of the [<i>insert favorite team</i>] game?” But Siri gets more involved in the minutia. If you want to know who the home run leader is this season, Siri will tell you that Aaron Judge is the current home run leader while Assistant will give you a Wikipedia result of the all-time leaders. Both knew when the next Red Sox game was, but neither could tell us when the NBA Finals started (both did bring up the next game in the playoffs, however). And Siri knew that the French Open had started.</p>\n<h3><b>‘TELL ME A JOKE’</b></h3><p><b>WINNER:</b> GOOGLE ASSISTANT</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0043-0215/474417-1-eng-US/f0043-022.jpg\" width=\"611\" height=\"534\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0043-02\" title=\"f0043-02\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>Siri and Assistant both want to be more than programmed chatbots, so each has its own personality and a sense of humor. So, both tell jokes. Or, more specifically, both tell bad jokes. Siri and Assistant will both happily oblige to a variety of queries (including simply saying “joke”), but Assistant’s were a bit more engaging. Siri tended to stick to one-liners; whole Assistant’s jokes tended to be more question-based. (Siri’s sense of humor is also a bit more iPhone-centric.)

may forever be locked in a fight for mobile domination, but they take very different approaches to their quest for market share. On the one hand, there are more than 2 billion active Android devices in use around the world. On the other, Apple makes gobs of money from selling just a handful of handsets.</p>\n<p>But like the PC wars of the 90s, Apple isn’t content with such a slim slice of the market. While it has had a <a href=\"http://go.macworld.com/mov\" target=\"_self\">Move to iOS app</a> in the Play Store for a while now, Apple is now taking the fight directly to Android users with a new campaign devoted to switching.</p>\n<p>Head over to the <a href=\"https://apple.com/switch\" target=\"_self\">iPhone tab</a> on Apple’s website and you’ll see a new box in the middle of the page. Called “Why Switch,” it declares that “Life is easier on iPhone,” and offers 10 questions potential switchers might be asking:</p>\n<p>1. Will it be easy to switch to iPhone?</p>\n<p>2. Is the camera as good as they say?</p>\n<p>3. Why is iPhone so fast?</p>\n<p>4. Will iPhone be easy to use?</p>\n<p>5. How does iPhone help protect my personal information?</p>\n<p>6. What makes Messages so great?</p>\n<p>7. Can I get help from a real person?</p>\n<p>8. Can I switch at an Apple Store?</p>\n<p>9. What about the environment?</p>\n<p>10. Will I love my iPhone?</p>\n<p>And finally, it asks, “Are you ready to switch?” while offering links to purchase any of the five phone models. The site also promotes Apple’s <a href=\"http://go.macworld.com/ti\" target=\"_self\">trade-in policy</a>, boasting up to $260 in credits.</p>\n<p>There is also a <a href=\"http://go.macworld.com/avd\" target=\"_self\">series of videos</a> on Apple’s YouTube channel to highlight many of the points, including speed, ease of switching, and privacy. It’s unclear whether Apple plans on taking the campaign beyond the web, but it’s not too hard to see a TV or print campaign accompanying the site.</p>\n<p>Earlier this year, Google unveiled its own <a href=\"https://android.com/switch\" target=\"_self\">switching site</a>, coinciding with a new transfer tool that synced your contacts, calendar entries, and photos through Google Drive. It’s similar in practice to Apple’s Move to iOS app, but doesn’t require the installation of an app you won’t need after the transfer is finished.</p>\n<p>Apple ran a highly successful <a href=\"http://go.macworld.com/sca\" target=\"_self\">switcher campaign</a> in the early 2000s, which used real people to tell stories about why they moved to a Mac. While Tim Cook has said upwards of 30 percent of new iPhone buyers are making the switch from an Android phone, Apple hasn’t previously launched an ad campaign targeted at Android.</p>\n<p>Flip the switch: It’s no secret that Apple is looking for signs of growth. While the upcoming iPhone 8 will surely boost sales in the holiday quarter, Apple still needs to generate excitement during the rest of the year, which has proven difficult due to a steady stream of rumors and flagship competitors from the likes of LG and Samsung. But a new switcher campaign could be just what the doctor ordered.</p>\n<p class=\"pullQuote\">Flip the switch: It’s no secret that Apple is looking for signs of growth.</p>\n","layout":{"landscape":{"id":"am-landscape-10","link":"ioscentral_article_01-l.twig"},"portrait":{"id":"am-portrait-10","link":"ioscentral_article_01.twig"}},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":1,"link_source":"","competition":[],"flatplan_title":"","notes":"","gutter_credit":"","other":"","image":[{"id":"95c9254f4685db6845f430fcff22f636","name":"switrch","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/switrch/477376-1-eng-US/switrch.jpg?t=story_img_size_768x0&ext/switrch_story_img_size_768x0.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"1547","height":"1004","legacy_id":"32121","is_default":true},{"id":"95c9254f4685db6845f430fcff22f636","name":"switrch","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/switrch/477376-1-eng-US/switrch.jpg?t=story_img_size_768x0&ext/switrch_story_img_size_768x0.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"1547","height":"1004","legacy_id":"32121","is_default":false}],"related_objects":{"image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1497545487.5268","name":"f0044-01","source":"IMAGE: APPLE","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0044-0166/474516-1-eng-US/f0044-012.jpg?t=story_img_size_768x0&ext/f0044-012_story_img_size_768x0.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"1056","height":"474","legacy_id":"31865"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1497545487.5268","name":"f0044-01","source":"IMAGE: APPLE","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0044-0166/474516-1-eng-US/f0044-012.jpg?t=story_img_size_768x0&ext/f0044-012_story_img_size_768x0.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"1056","height":"474","legacy_id":"31865"}]},"url_alias":"http://macworld-us.audiencemedia.com","type":"story","order":"9","folio_number":"44","folio_numbers":"44,45","pdf_page_index":"44","thumbnail":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/switrch/477376-1-eng-US/switrch.jpg?t=tablet_story_thumbnail&ext/switrch_tablet_story_thumbnail.jpg","color":"2699cd","real_id":"31864","main_section_id":"1728","ads":[]},{"id":"zinio_285_100340926_1497545488.7304","title":"Apple invests $200 million in Corning to innovate on Gorilla Glass","sub_title":"","author":[{"id":"0","name":"CAITLIN McGARRY","email":"noreply@audiencemedia.com","is_default":false}],"tag":"","strap_line":"Gorilla Glass","intro":"Corning’s Kentucky-based glass production facility is the first beneficiary of Apple’s $1 billion U.S. manufacturing fund.","body":"<p class=\"byline\"><b>BY CAITLIN McGARRY</b></p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0046-0165/474552-1-eng-US/f0046-012.jpg\" width=\"975\" height=\"622\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0046-01\" title=\"f0046-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n <span class=\"credit\">\nIMAGE: APPLE</span></figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p><b>A</b>pple wasted no time putting its $1 billion U.S. <a href=\"http://go.macworld.com/manu\" target=\"_self\">manufacturing fund</a> to work, announcing Friday that it will invest $200 million into Corning’s Harrodsburg, Kentucky glass-making plant.</p>\n<p>Corning, as everyone knows, manufactures the glass that Apple has used in iPhones and iPads since day one.</p>\n<p>“Corning is a great example of a supplier that has continued to innovate and they are one of Apple’s long-standing suppliers,” Apple COO Jeff Williams said in a Friday statement announcing the investment. “This partnership started 10 years ago with the very first iPhone, and today every customer that buys an iPhone or iPad anywhere in the world touches glass that was developed in America.

A person might feel symptoms like dizziness or shortness of breath, then check their heart rate to confirm something weird is going on. A team of researchers just proved that the watch’s heart rate sensor can actually detect an early sign of heart disease without any symptoms at all, a development that could change how people use their Apple Watches.</p>\n<p>The Apple Watch’s heart rate sensor can accurately pick up atrial fibrillation, an abnormal heart rate that can lead to stroke or heart disease. Atrial fibrillation can be caused by a variety of factors, including high blood pressure, so the Apple Watch isn’t a diagnostic device. But its accurate heart rate sensor shows there is potential for the watch as a <a href=\"http://go.macworld.com/ha\" target=\"_self\">health and fitness tool</a> beyond its basic fitness-tracking features.</p>\n<p>Developers of the Apple Watch app <a href=\"http://go.macworld.com/cog\" target=\"_self\">Cardiogram</a> worked with researchers leading the University of California San Francisco’s <a href=\"https://health-eheartstudy.org\" target=\"_self\">Health eHeart study</a> () to develop a ResearchKit-based study of their own called mRhythm (cardiogr.am/research). Recently, Cardiogram and UCSF’s cardiology division presented the results of that 14-month study, which collected more than 100 million heart rate data points from more than 6,000 Apple Watch users. Cardiogram developed a machine learning-powered algorithm that can detect atrial fibrillation, which is often asymptomatic.</p>\n<p>Cardiogram’s algorithm was tested against an in-hospital test called cardioversion. Patients experiencing atrial fibrillation, which affects one in four people in their lifetime and causes 25 percent of all strokes, wore an Apple Watch while undergoing cardioversion to compare outcomes. Both segments, the cardioversion test and the Apple Watch’s heart rate data, were blinded against whether the patients’ heart rates were normal or abnormal, then sent to Cardiogram’s algorithm. The results: the Apple Watch data detected atrial fibrillation 97 percent of the time.</p>\n<p>Cardiogram developer Brandon Ballinger said the results were surprising.</p>\n<p>“I don’t think anyone would’ve expected at the beginning of this study that a product you can just walk into an Apple Store and purchase would have 97 percent accuracy,” Ballinger told <i>Macworld</i>. “Apple did a fantastic job with the sensor.”</p>\n<p>Does that mean the Apple Watch’s optical heart rate sensor is always accurate? Not exactly, said Dr. Gregory Marcus, director of clinical research for UCSF’s cardiology division and lead researcher for the eHeart study.</p>\n<p>They’re “sufficiently accurate so as to distinguish a consistently irregularly regular rhythm,” Marcus said.</p>\n<p>Basically, the beats per minute as displayed on the watch screen may not be precise, but the sensor can accurately detect irregularity in those beats.</p>\n<p>“If you had a certain rate of inaccuracy, presumably on a population level that would be fairly consistent,” Marcus said. “As long as that’s not markedly different, it shouldn’t really matter as long as intermittently it’s getting it right. We’re not using it to tell us what the actual heart rate is, we’re using it to help us discriminate between a normal rhythm and atrial fibrillation.”</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0050-0170/474581-1-eng-US/f0050-012.jpg\" width=\"787\" height=\"365\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0050-01\" title=\"f0050-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n <span class=\"credit\">\nIMAGE: APPLE</span></figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>THE FUTURE OF HEALTH APPS</b></h3><p>The fact that Cardiogram has leveraged the Apple Watch’s heart rate data to develop an algorithm that can accurately detect an early symptom of heart disease is major. Apple CEO Tim Cook has said that Apple isn’t interested in submitting the watch for approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which would significantly slow down the speed of hardware development. But Cardiogram’s Ballinger said he’s interested in testing the algorithm his team has developed more extensively and eventually submitting it for FDA approval, so Cardiogram’s watch app will be able to alert users when they should see a doctor.</p>\n<p>“I think health will be the dominant use case for Apple Watch and other wearables,” Ballinger said. “The average user of Cardiogram opens the app about five times a day. Heart rate data reflects everything that happens in your life. People use it for medical conditions but also everyday things like, ‘How well am I sleeping?’ or, ‘How stressful was this meeting?’ When I show this data to people it usually resonates with them. They say, ‘Oh, I had no idea you can find out all of this stuff from the watch’s heart rate sensor.’ In 10 years it’ll be silly to not have a heart monitor.”</p>\n<p>Cardiogram’s current watch app uses your heart rate data to offer lifestyle insights, as other health apps do. But in the not-too-distant future, health apps like Cardiogram will be much more powerful.</p>\n","layout":{"landscape":{"id":"am-landscape-10","link":"ioscentral_article_01-l.twig"},"portrait":{"id":"am-portrait-10","link":"ioscentral_article_01.twig"}},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":1,"link_source":"","competition":[],"flatplan_title":"","notes":"","gutter_credit":"","other":"","image":[{"id":"e611a971d422d935d34051d3e7789b90","name":"heart","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/heart/477383-1-eng-US/heart.jpg?t=story_img_size_768x0&ext/heart_story_img_size_768x0.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"2525","height":"1688","legacy_id":"32122","is_default":true},{"id":"e611a971d422d935d34051d3e7789b90","name":"heart","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/heart/477383-1-eng-US/heart.jpg?t=story_img_size_768x0&ext/heart_story_img_size_768x0.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"2525","height":"1688","legacy_id":"32122","is_default":false}],"related_objects":{"image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_1_1497545491.0623","name":"f0050-01","source":"IMAGE: APPLE","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0050-0170/474581-1-eng-US/f0050-012.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"787","height":"365","legacy_id":"31872"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_1_1497545491.0623","name":"f0050-01","source":"IMAGE: APPLE","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0050-0170/474581-1-eng-US/f0050-012.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"787","height":"365","legacy_id":"31872"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1497545492.039","name":"f0048-01","source":"IMAGE: CARDIOGRAM","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0048-0165/474588-1-eng-US/f0048-012.jpg?t=story_img_size_768x0&ext/f0048-012_story_img_size_768x0.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"969","height":"527","legacy_id":"31873"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1497545492.039","name":"f0048-01","source":"IMAGE: CARDIOGRAM","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0048-0165/474588-1-eng-US/f0048-012.jpg?t=story_img_size_768x0&ext/f0048-012_story_img_size_768x0.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"969","height":"527","legacy_id":"31873"}]},"url_alias":"http://macworld-us.audiencemedia.com","type":"story","order":"11","folio_number":"48","folio_numbers":"48,49,50","pdf_page_index":"48","thumbnail":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/heart/477383-1-eng-US/heart.jpg?t=tablet_story_thumbnail&ext/heart_tablet_story_thumbnail.jpg","color":"2699cd","real_id":"31871","main_section_id":"1728","ads":[]},{"id":"zinio_285_100340926_1497545493.4002","title":"K’ABLEKEY REVIEW: VERSATILE IPHONE FLASH DRIVE DOUBLES AS LIGHTNING CHARGE CABLE","sub_title":"Review | K'ablekey","author":[{"id":"0","name":"J.R.

Until Apple graces us with true mobile file manager functionality, this is as good as it gets.</p>\n<h3><b>KEY RING STORAGE</b></h3><p>French startup <a href=\"https://pkparis.com\" target=\"_self\">PKparis</a> makes the best of this situation with the inspired K’ablekey, a versatile flash drive sold in a trio of configurations: 16GB (the model reviewed here), 32GB, and 64GB. Storage capacity aside, each model is identical, with a rounded metal hub that separates into a pair of wedges connected by a plastic-coated cable just a hair over two inches in length.</p>\n<p>One wedge features a USB 3.0 plug capable of up to 120MBps read and 20MBps write speeds on Mac or PC, while the opposite side uses a Lightning plug for attaching to a compatible iOS device. The wedges are magnetically charged and snap tightly together, converting the K’ablekey cable into a loop that can be attached to a key ring; the entire flash drive weighs only 27 grams, making it quite portable.</p>\n<p>Each plug is protected by rubberized orange caps that are removed as needed. Unlike competing flash drives like <a href=\"http://go.macworld.com/trackrrev\" target=\"_self\">Transcend JetDrive Go 300</a> with easily misplaced plastic caps, PKparis has an ingenious solution to this problem. Not only can the caps be stacked together, but they’re also magnetized, so they can be attached to your Mac or the back of an iOS device while in use. K’ablekey is durable and rated for IP54 water resistance, although I do have concerns about the cable’s longevity; thankfully, each flash drive comes with a two-year warranty.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0052-0166/474631-1-eng-US/f0052-012.jpg\" width=\"521\" height=\"552\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0052-01\" title=\"f0052-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>CHARGE AND PLAY</b></h3><p>The unique design affords K’ablekey one big convenience over competitors: With the Lightning end plugged into an iOS device and the other to a computer or USB AC adapter, the flash drive serves double-duty as a portable charging cable. I wish PKparis had gone a step further by allowing you to transfer files the same way; iOS access is disabled while charging, although the flash drive is accessible when connected to Mac or PC.</p>\n<p>Like all iOS flash drives, K’ablekey’s storage can only be accessed via a free companion app. PK memory is serviceably capable, with support for most common video, audio, photo, and document file types and the ability to copy or move files between iOS and flash storage. Video playback is immediate, and the app saves photos and videos with native filenames, which is a plus.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0053-0152/474617-1-eng-US/f0053-012.jpg\" width=\"401\" height=\"711\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0053-01\" title=\"f0053-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>K’ablekey offers fast video playback through the PK memory app, and files can be displayed as a list or in two sizes of grid view.</b></p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>Unfortunately, PK memory doesn’t play nice with others—there’s no support for iOS file sharing with other apps, native AirPlay or Chromecast capability, and it’s not optimized for larger iPad screens.

Yet there’s no denying the company helps fuel mainstream adoption by doing it better than everyone else. The new iPhone is rumored to introduce wireless charging, which has yet to hit the tipping point.</p>\n<p>There have been several attempts to bolt wireless charging onto the iPhone, but none do it as well as FLI Charge (<a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/y7nqgpzc\" target=\"_self\">$149</a> for the Essential Setup). At the heart of this charging bundle is the FLIway 40, a silver/white charging pad measuring 8.66 inches across, 3.92 inches deep, and half an inch thick. It’s the first to offer 40 watts of power, enough to charge multiple devices at once—far more than competing products can handle.</p>\n<p>Since the required conductive charging technology isn’t yet built into iOS hardware, the company sells a $69 case that adds this functionality to the iPhone 6/6s and 6.6s Plus, iPhone 7/7s, or 7/7s Plus. Although the FLIcase adds unwelcome bulk to these sleek smartphones, it also offers great protection, with a smooth matte finish that feels great in the hand, plus a slick two-piece design that allows the case to be removed with ease.</p>\n<p>With the FLIcase attached, all that’s required to charge is setting your iPhone on the charging pad. Unlike competing wireless chargers, there’s no “sweet spot.” Four metallic contacts on the back of the case guarantee proper charging. Speeds are comparable to a regular wall outlet, but there’s no wear and tear on the Lightning port since you just grab the iPhone and go.</p>\n<p>There are some limitations. With the FLIcase on, you lose access to the Lightning port, substituted with a micro-USB port that protrudes half an inch from the bottom. A charging cable is included, as well as a headphone adapter to extend that port. The FLIway 40 power adapter is rather large, often obstructing use of the adjacent AC plug.</p>\n<h3><b>CHARGE ANYTHING</b></h3><p>With the FLI Charge, you’re not limited to wireless devices. The company offers two $29 accessories capable of powering wired devices from the same charging pad: the <a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/ybeg6ko4\" target=\"_self\">FLIcube</a>, a 1.61-inch square with a single USB port used with existing charging cables, and the <a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/yb6omr23\" target=\"_self\">FLIcoin</a>, a small white puck with a six-inch cable in either Lightning or micro-USB flavors tucked along the edge.</p>\n<p>Using these accessories, it’s easy to charge up to 12 devices at once. The FLIway 40 regulates more juice to devices that need it (smartphones, tablets), pushing less to lower voltage gadgets like Bluetooth headphones and smartwatches. It’s easy to still wind up with a tangle of cables, though. I set up the FLIway 40 in our kitchen with my wife’s iPhone 6s in a FLIcase, a FLIcube for her iPad, and a pair of FLIcoins for the kids’ iPad minis, which bordered on a mess.</p>\n<p>That said, until Apple adds built-in wireless charging, this is as good as it gets for iPhone owners. FLI Charge components are available separately as well as in the bundle reviewed here, making it easy to place several charging pads around the home so they’re always close at hand.</p>\n<h3><b>BOTTOM LINE</b></h3><p>Mixing wireless convenience with the ability to power any gadget that plugs into a USB port, FLI Charge offers a versatile way to charge multiple devices from a single place.</p>\n","layout":{"landscape":{"id":"am-landscape-11","link":"ioscentral_review-l.twig"},"portrait":{"id":"am-portrait-11","link":"ioscentral_review.twig"}},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":1,"link_source":"","competition":[],"flatplan_title":"","notes":"","gutter_credit":"","other":"","image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1497545496.8965","name":"f0054-01","source":"IMAGE: FLI CHARGE","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0054-0161/474667-1-eng-US/f0054-012.jpg?t=story_img_size_768x0&ext/f0054-012_story_img_size_768x0.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"975","height":"533","legacy_id":"31882","is_default":true},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1497545496.8965","name":"f0054-01","source":"IMAGE: FLI CHARGE","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0054-0161/474667-1-eng-US/f0054-012.jpg?t=story_img_size_768x0&ext/f0054-012_story_img_size_768x0.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"975","height":"533","legacy_id":"31882","is_default":false}],"url_alias":"http://macworld-us.audiencemedia.com","type":"story","order":"13","folio_number":"54","folio_numbers":"54,55","pdf_page_index":"54","thumbnail":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0054-0161/474667-1-eng-US/f0054-012.jpg?t=tablet_story_thumbnail&ext/f0054-012_tablet_story_thumbnail.jpg","color":"2699cd","real_id":"31881","main_section_id":"1728","ads":[]},{"id":"zinio_285_100340926_1497545498.0891","title":"APP STORE","sub_title":"What's new at the","author":[{"id":"0","name":"","email":"noreply@audiencemedia.com","is_default":false}],"tag":"","strap_line":"THINGS 3","intro":"Things has launched version 3.0 for iPhone/AppleWatch/ iPad—a comprehensive task manager that helps you collect your thoughts, plan your day, then stay on task.
