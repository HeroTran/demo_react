New features include sweeping new upgrades to Siri, a redesigned Control Center and App Store, and a brandnew Apple Pay feature that lets you send or receive money to your contacts via iMessage.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0066-0168/474838-1-eng-US/f0066-012.jpg\" width=\"938\" height=\"320\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0066-01\" title=\"f0066-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>In addition, developers can now create apps that tap into your iOS device’s potential to create augmented reality experiences via the new ARKit. Plus, there are new productivity features for the iPad, including drag-and-drop capability and a new Mac-style Dock.</p>\n<p>Here’s everything we know so far about iOS 11, plus a few of the new features that we can’t wait to try.</p>\n<h3><b>WHAT iOS DEVICES WILL IT RUN ON?</b></h3><p><b>The following iPhones:</b></p>\n<p>&gt; iPhone 7/Plus</p>\n<p>&gt; iPhone 6s/Plus</p>\n<p>&gt; iPhone 6/Plus</p>\n<p>&gt; iPhone SE</p>\n<p>&gt; iPhone 5s</p>\n<p><b>The following iPads:</b></p>\n<p>&gt; iPad Pro (12.9-inch, 10.5-inch, and 9.7‑inch)</p>\n<p>&gt; iPad Air</p>\n<p>&gt; iPad Air 2</p>\n<p>&gt; iPad (5th generation)</p>\n<p>&gt; iPad mini 2/3/4</p>\n<p>Plus, the iPod Touch (6th generation).</p>\n<h3><b>WHEN WILL IT BE AVAILABLE?</b></h3><p>Following a series of developer and public betas this summer, Apple will make iOS 11 available to everyone as a free upgrade later this fall—likely around the same time as the launch of the next iPhone, typically in early or mid-September.</p>\n<h3><b>CAN I TEST THE iOS 11 PUBLIC BETA?</b></h3><p>Yes, Apple will probably start rolling out the first public beta in June and anyone can give it a whirl (at their own risk). First, log in to the Beta Software Program page using your Apple ID and click on the link to enroll your iOS device. In order to download and install a configuration profile, you’ll be instructed to go to <a href=\"http://beta.apple.com/profile\" target=\"_self\">beta.apple.com/profile</a> on the iOS device that you want to put the beta on—that will make the beta available as an over-the-air software update in the Settings app.</p>\n<p>Just remember that this is a beta version of the new software, so make sure you back up your iOS device before venturing into this unknown territory. Better yet, we recommend installing the public beta profile on a secondary iOS device (if you have one) so that you can test it without fear that it will screw something up.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/translate/477404-1-eng-US/translate.jpg\" width=\"461\" height=\"750\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"Translate\" title=\"Translate\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>WHAT’S NEW WITH SIRI?</b></h3><p>The first new thing you’ll notice about Siri in iOS 11 is her more-natural sounding voice. However, she also looks a little different: Apple has given its voice assistant a new visual interface that surfaces multiple results for your requests, as well as follow-up questions. In addition, Siri can now translate phrases for you, from English to Chinese, French, German, Italian, and Spanish. This feature is in beta, and Apple will add more languages in the months to come.</p>\n<p>Siri has also become more predictive across different iOS apps. For example, if you search for <b>Iceland</b> in Safari, Siri will surface Iceland-related articles in the News app and bring up QuickType suggestions in Icelandic. Or, if you get a text message asking for money, Siri will suggest iMessage’s Apple Pay integration with the exact amount that’s been requested. Apple has also expanded SiriKit support to include more robust integrations with third-party services. You can now use Siri to add to your Evernote or pull up a QR code in WeChat, among other things.</p>\n<h3><b>HOW IS APPLE PAY MORE LIKE VENMO?</b></h3><p>You can use Apple Pay at certain brickand- mortar stores (Apple says 50 percent of U.S. retailers will support Apple Pay by the end of the year), online web stores via Safari, and in certain iPhone apps. With iOS 11, you’ll be able to use Apple Pay to send or receive money from your contacts via Messages, thanks to a new iMessage app which essentially turns Apple Pay into your new Venmo or Square Cash alternative.</p>\n<p>All the money that you receive will be collected in your Wallet app in the form of a Cash card. You can use these funds to complete other Apple Pay transactions, or you can transfer that cash over to your bank account. Apple Pay’s peer-to-peer transactions will be available in iOS 11 and watchOS 4.</p>\n<h3><b>CAN I DO MORE WITH LIVE PHOTOS?</b></h3><p>Yes! Apple has given us more editing tools for Live Photos, those moving images that you can take using an iPhone 6s and later. You can turn your Live Photos into video loops that replay over…and over…and over. The Photos app will even suggest Live Photos that would make for great loops. You can also add a Bounce effect so that the Live Photo plays and then rewinds, kind of like Instagram Boomerangs. There’s also a new Long Exposure effect which makes the iPhone even more like a DSLR.</p>\n<p class=\"pullQuote\">You can use Apple Pay at certain brick-and-mortar stores (Apple says 50 percent of U.S. retailers will support Apple Pay by the end of the year), online web stores via Safari, and in certain iPhone apps.</p>\n<h3><b>BUT DON’T LIVE PHOTOS TAKE UP A LOT OF SPACE?</b></h3><p>That’s true, but thankfully Apple has addressed this issue by switching to a more space-efficient encoding system. For videos, iOS 11 uses HEVC (aka H.265), which is twice as efficient as the previous H.264 format. For still photos, iOS 11 uses HEIF (High Efficiency Image Format) which Apple claims will take up only half the space.</p>\n<h3><b>WHERE WILL I BE ABLE TO USE MAPS INDOORS?</b></h3><p>Apple continues to improve the native Maps app in iOS 11. For the first time, you’ll be able to use Maps to navigate your way around indoor spaces. Maps in iOS 11 introduces indoor mapping so you can get detailed floor plans of certain malls and major airports, down to individual vendors on each floor.</p>\n<p>To start off, Maps will have indoor support for malls in Boston, Chicago, Hong Kong, London, Los Angeles, New York, Philadelphia, San Francisco, San Jose, Tokyo, and Washington D.C. Maps will also be able to show you around inside 30 major airports including JFK and London Heathrow.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/map/477411-1-eng-US/map.jpg\" width=\"509\" height=\"743\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"map\" title=\"map\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div>\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/disturb/477418-1-eng-US/disturb.jpg\" width=\"498\" height=\"758\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"disturb\" title=\"disturb\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>HOW DOES ‘DO NOT DISTURB WHILE DRIVING’ WORK?</b></h3><p>Another feature introduced at WWDC is iOS 11’s Do Not Disturb While Driving mode. Your iPhone will use Bluetooth (if connected to CarPlay or any other in-vehicle Bluetooth system) or motion sensors to figure out if you’re driving, and will automatically prevent all notifications from surfacing and causing a distraction. You can override this mode, however, or set up an automatic response to let people who text you know you’re on the road and that you’ll get back to them as soon as you arrive at your destination.</p>\n<h3><b>WHAT ABOUT AUGMENTED REALITY?</b></h3><p>Tim Cook has spent all year talking about how excited he is for augmented reality, so it’s no surprise that Apple used this year’s WWDC keynote to show off what they’ve been working on in this emerging area. Alongside iOS 11, Apple unveiled ARKit, a new developer platform for creating iOS apps that tap into augment- ed reality. Apps built with ARKit will be able to use computer vision to identify surfaces and add 3D objects. These objects create dynamic shadows that are rendered in real-time.</p>\n<h3><b>DID THE iPAD GET MORE macOS-TYPE FEATURES?</b></h3><p>You bet! There’s a new app Dock that looks a lot like the one in macOS, making it a lot easier to switch between apps. You can also press on any of these apps and drag them over to the right side of the screen to open them as a Slide Over. As always, you can lock Slide Over into Split View to use both apps simultaneously.</p>\n<p>The Dock can be accessed from any screen and you can customize it with your favorite apps. Also, it has a dynamic section on the right side that changes to suggest recently used apps across your Apple devices.</p>\n<h3><b>WHAT ABOUT DRAG-ANDDROP?</b></h3><p>Yes! Apple finally answered our prayers. With iOS 11, you can drag-and-drop between the two apps in Split View, which makes it easier to transfer files, images, text, and URLs. You can drag-attach images from the Photos to Mail, or drag-copy-andpaste directions from Safari into Maps.</p>\n<h3><b>AND HOW DOES THE NEW FILES APP WORK?</b></h3><p>Apple also launched Files, a new iOS app intended to make the iPad experience more like a traditional Mac. Pretty selfexplanatory, Files displays your documents stored in iCloud, Dropbox, Google Drive, and other file-storage apps.</p>\n<h3><b>ARE THERE NEW WAYS TO USE APPLE PENCIL?</b></h3><p>Yes, Apple has expanded Apple Pencil support for the iPad Pro in iOS 11. Tap a PDF or screenshot with the tip of the Pencil and you’ll be able to scribble on it instantly thanks to a new feature called Instant Markup. Similarly, you can Pencil-tap on the Lock screen to start writing. All your handwritten creations will be automatically saved to your Notes app, and these handwritten notes are searchable, too.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0071-0154/474810-1-eng-US/f0071-012.jpg\" width=\"975\" height=\"533\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0071-01\" title=\"f0071-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>Notes also has a new built-in Document Scanner, allowing you to scan a document, sign it or mark on it with Apple Pencil, then save or share—all with just your iPad Pro. In addition, Notes and Mail now support Inline Drawing so you can add some color to your emails and notes. The text will automatically move out of the way when you start drawing, so that everything remains legible.</p>\n<h3><b>A FEW MORE THINGS...</b></h3><p><b>Control Center</b> has been redesigned so that it’s only one panel. You can customize it with your go-to’s like Low Power Mode and use 3D Touch to adjust more-specific controls.</p>\n<p><b>App Store</b> now mirrors the look-and-feel of Apple Music, with a new Today tab for featured games and apps.</p>\n<p><b>Messages App Drawer</b> makes it easier to access your favorite iMessage apps by swiping across the bottom of the screen, instead of having to tap back to the drawer every time you want to switch apps.</p>\n<p><b>Apple Music</b> gets more social: New profile photos indicate when one of your friends has listened to a certain albums or playlist.</p>\n<p><b>QuickType Keyboard</b> is now easier to use one-handed. Simply long-press on the emoji key to bring the keys closer to your thumb. For iPad users, you can now flick down on a specific key to type a number or punctuation mark, instead of having to switch to the symbols keyboard.</p>\n","layout":{"landscape":{"id":"am-landscape-29","link":"feature_03-l.twig"},"portrait":{"id":"am-portrait-29","link":"feature_03.twig"}},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":1,"link_source":"","competition":[],"flatplan_title":"","notes":"","gutter_credit":"","other":"","image":[{"id":"c8cdd1817dff43242a5742ec682ca09f","name":"ios-opener","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/ios-opener/477397-1-eng-US/ios-opener.jpg?t=story_img_size_768x0&ext/ios-opener_story_img_size_768x0.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"2048","height":"1536","legacy_id":"32124","is_default":true},{"id":"c8cdd1817dff43242a5742ec682ca09f","name":"ios-opener","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/ios-opener/477397-1-eng-US/ios-opener.jpg?t=story_img_size_768x0&ext/ios-opener_story_img_size_768x0.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"2048","height":"1536","legacy_id":"32124","is_default":false}],"related_objects":{"image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_5_1497545507.0864","name":"f0071-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0071-0154/474810-1-eng-US/f0071-012.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"975","height":"533","legacy_id":"31899"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_5_1497545507.0864","name":"f0071-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0071-0154/474810-1-eng-US/f0071-012.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"975","height":"533","legacy_id":"31899"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_4_1497545507.8091","name":"f0069-02","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0069-0225/474817-1-eng-US/f0069-022.jpg?t=story_img_size_768x0&ext/f0069-022_story_img_size_768x0.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"318","height":"584","legacy_id":"31900"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_4_1497545507.8091","name":"f0069-02","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0069-0225/474817-1-eng-US/f0069-022.jpg?t=story_img_size_768x0&ext/f0069-022_story_img_size_768x0.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"318","height":"584","legacy_id":"31900"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_3_1497545508.4956","name":"f0069-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0069-0151/474824-1-eng-US/f0069-012.jpg?t=story_img_size_768x0&ext/f0069-012_story_img_size_768x0.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"335","height":"589","legacy_id":"31901"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_3_1497545508.4956","name":"f0069-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0069-0151/474824-1-eng-US/f0069-012.jpg?t=story_img_size_768x0&ext/f0069-012_story_img_size_768x0.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"335","height":"589","legacy_id":"31901"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_2_1497545509.1761","name":"f0067-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0067-0152/474831-1-eng-US/f0067-012.jpg?t=story_img_size_768x0&ext/f0067-012_story_img_size_768x0.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"333","height":"587","legacy_id":"31902"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_2_1497545509.1761","name":"f0067-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0067-0152/474831-1-eng-US/f0067-012.jpg?t=story_img_size_768x0&ext/f0067-012_story_img_size_768x0.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"333","height":"587","legacy_id":"31902"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_1_1497545509.867","name":"f0066-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0066-0168/474838-1-eng-US/f0066-012.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"938","height":"320","legacy_id":"31903"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_1_1497545509.867","name":"f0066-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0066-

tools.</b></p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p><b>T</b>he next version of Apple’s operating system for the Mac is called <a href=\"https://apple.co/2r3IGvn\" target=\"_self\">macOS High Sierra</a>. While the OS is mostly about software refinements, it also lays the foundation for future innovations in the worlds of VR (virtual reality) and AR (augmented reality).</p>\n<p>You can learn more by taking a look at our favorite High Sierra features we list here. That’s followed by a FAQ, where you can get details on High Sierra’s release date, system requirements, installation instructions, and more.</p>\n<h3><b>A NEW FILE SYSTEM</b></h3><p>Ever since System 8, the Mac has used the HFS+ file system to keep our documents and directories running smoothly, but at last year’s WWDC, a new <a href=\"http://go.macworld.com/apfs\" target=\"_self\">Apple File System</a> (APFS) was announced. It made it into iOS with the iOS <a href=\"http://go.macworld.com/103\" target=\"_self\">10.3 update</a>, and with High Sierra it’s also coming to the Mac. But where the changes to iOS are largely behind the scenes, you’ll really get to see it in action in the new macOS.</p>\n<p>One of the main tenets of High Sierra, APFS will be the new default file system, bringing an advanced 64-bit architecture and a responsive design to cut down on the time it takes to do common tasks. Apple VP Craig Federighi quickly demoed how fast files are copied, and it should save quite a bit of time, even on older Macs. APFS also brings some heavy-duty security, including built?in encryption, crash?safe protections, and simplified data backup on the go.</p>\n<h3><b>BETTER PHOTOS</b></h3><p>Photos is rapidly becoming one of the most used apps on our Macs, and in High Sierra it looks like we’ll be spending even more time with it. A slew of new features await us in the new OS, including better organization, looped Live Photos, and new Memories categories. It’ll also be easier to identify who’s in your photos with more accurate People identification and cross- device syncing for albums.</p>\n<p>But the coolest feature may be a set of new built-in editing tools. Photos already lets us make some awesome adjustments to our snapshots, but High Sierra seriously ups the game with powerful pro-level tools—like a curves palette for fine-tuning color and contrast, a selective color dropper to hone a specific hue, and new filters that will make your photos fit for an art gallery. And for all your gallery- and album-worthy photos, Apple has now partnered with third-party apps to give you more publishing and printing options.</p>\n<p class=\"pullQuote\">A new system of intelligent tracking will use machine learning to identify prying advertising trackers that track your online behavior and remove the cross-site tracking data they leave behind.</p>\n<h3><b>SPEEDIER, SMARTER SAFARI</b></h3><p>Apple’s browser always gets a tune-up whenever a new version of macOS comes out, but this time around Federighi says the improvements coming in High Sierra actually make it the world’s fastest desktop browser. It features 80 percent faster JavaScript performance when compared to Chrome, which should help us surf way quicker.</p>\n<p>But we’re more interested in two new features that address what it’s like to use the Internet in 2017. The first will eliminate one of the more annoying features of the modern web: autoplay videos. Whereas Safari in Sierra tells you which tab is playing audio, in High Sierra, it will shut the video down before it can start. Autoplay blocking will detect which sites are delivering unwanted videos, and then press the pause button for you.</p>\n<p>Along with our ears, the new Safari will also protect our privacy. A new system of intelligent tracking will use machine learning to identify prying advertising trackers that track your online behavior and remove the cross-site tracking data they leave behind. That means you won’t get hit up with three dozen vacuum ads the next time you buy one on Amazon.</p>\n<h3><b>SMOOTHER VIDEO</b></h3><p>We watch a lot of video on our Macs, and High Sierra is making the experience even better. In addition to supporting 4K where available, it’s also upgrading to the new industry standard, High Efficiency Video Coding (or H.265 for short). The new system compresses video up to 40 percent more than H.264, the current video standard. Under the new codec, videos will stream smoother and take up less space, both of which will make the experience much more pleasant. And if you’re a video creator, the new standard will also be built into Pro Tools so your projects will be able to take full advantage of it right from the start.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0075-0155/474888-1-eng-US/f0075-012.jpg\" width=\"768\" height=\"480\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0075-01\" title=\"f0075-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>Metal 2 will let developers create even more powerful games and apps.</b></p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>NEXT-LEVEL METAL</b></h3><p>When Metal was introduced in <a href=\"http://go.macworld.com/ec\" target=\"_self\">El Capitan</a>, it brought a slew of under-the-hood changes to make games and graphics sing, and now it’s ready to deliver the next generation, appropriately called Metal 2. The new technology will open up games to a whole new world of power, with a new API and powerful tools for developers. Metal 2 will bring 10 times the draw call throughput that Metal delivered, enabling graphics that are far more robust while adding external GPU support for hard-core gamers.</p>\n<p>But Metal 2 also brings support for something sorely missing from today’s Macs: virtual reality. High Sierra lets developers create interactive and immersive virtual reality experiences on the Mac for the very first time that will work with the HTC Vive and Unreal Engine for VR. And to show how serious it is about VR, Apple is even offering developers an external graphics dev kit to get started, featuring a Thunderbolt 3 enclosure with an AMD Radeon RX 580 GPU. You know, until the <a href=\"http://go.macworld.com/imp\" target=\"_self\">iMac Pro</a> arrives in December.</p>\n<h3><b>OTHER FEATURES</b></h3><p>Since High Sierra is a maintenance release, there will be lots of little improvements all over your desktop that you might not even notice at first. In Mail, Search will now use Spotlight to quickly identify top hits, and you’ll be able to split your inbox and your compose window when you’re in full-screen view. You can add properly formatted tables to Notes and pin your most important ones. Siri has a more natural voice that sounds more like a person rather than a machine. And when you’re in a FaceTime call, you’ll be able to easily turn a special moment into a Live Photo so you can remember it forever.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0076-0172/474881-1-eng-US/f0076-012.jpg\" width=\"980\" height=\"412\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0076-01\" title=\"f0076-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>MACOS HIGH SIERRA FAQ</b></h3><p><b>What is the name and version number of the new macOS?</b> Apple names its macOS versions after California locations. This time, it named the new version High Sierra. The name follows Apple’s pattern of slightly changing the name of the previous version of the OS if the upgrade isn’t considered a big one. (See for example, Leopard and then Snow Leopard, Lion and then Mountain Lion.)</p>\n<p>Apple senior VP Craig Federighi joked during the <a href=\"http://go.macworld.com/wwk\" target=\"_self\">WWDC keynote</a> that the name could be “misconstrued,” but Federigi was reassured that the name High Sierra was “fully baked.”</p>\n<p>If you’re into version numbers, then you’ll be happy to know that this one is version 10.13.</p>\n<p><b>When will macOS High Sierra be released?</b></p>\n<p>Apple, as usual, said macOS High Sierra will be released this fall. “Fall” has typically meant the end of October for macOS releases, so if you’re making plans, that’s the area of your calendar to target.</p>\n<p><b>How much will macOS High Sierra cost?</b> Apple makes its operating systems free, so macOS High Sierra is a free upgrade for users who have macOS Sierra installed.</p>\n<p class=\"pullQuote\">If you are running Lion (version 10.7.5), Mountain Lion, Mavericks, Yosemite, or El Capitan, you can upgrade directly from one of those versions to Sierra.</p>\n<p><b>From what operating systems can I upgrade to macOS High Sierra?</b> If you have macOS Sierra (the current macOS version), you can upgrade straight to High Sierra without doing any other software installations.</p>\n<p>If you are running Lion (version 10.7.5), Mountain Lion, Mavericks, Yosemite, or El Capitan, you can upgrade directly from one of those versions to Sierra. Chances are this will still be the case with High Sierra.</p>\n<p>If you are running Leopard, you need to upgrade to <a href=\"http://go.macworld.com/slf\" target=\"_self\">Snow Leopard first</a>, then upgrade to El Capitan, and then upgrade to High Sierra. If you want to upgrade from Snow Leopard, you need to upgrade to El Capitan, and then you can upgrade to High Sierra.</p>\n<p><b>How do I get macOS High Sierra?</b> Apple will make the High Sierra upgrade available in the Mac App Store.</p>\n<p><b>Can I try macOS High Sierra before it is released?</b> If you are a developer, you can get a beta of macOS Sierra through the <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/programs/\" target=\"_self\">Apple Developer Program</a>. The developer beta is available now.</p>\n<p>Apple will make a beta available to the general public in late June. Apple releases public betas on a regular cycle and the betas are free, but come with the caveat that the software isn’t as stable as it would be at release—meaning it could cause problems on your Mac. However, if you do decide to try the beta, you can provide Apple with valuable feedback. Sign up for the public beta program online at <a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/pffuwnz\" target=\"_self\">tinyurl.com/pffuwnz</a>.</p>\n<p><b>What Macs are compatible with macOS High Sierra?</b></p>\n<p>&gt; MacBook Pro (2010 and later)</p>\n<p>&gt; MacBook (Late 2009 and later)</p>\n<p>&gt; MacBook Air (2010 and later)</p>\n<p>&gt; Mac Pro (2010 and later)</p>\n<p>&gt; iMac (Late 2009 and later)</p>\n<p>&gt; Mac mini (2010 and later)</p>\n<p><b>Should I upgrade to macOS Sierra?</b></p>\n<p>Whether you upgrade to High Sierra or not is up to you. First, you need to check to see if your Mac is compatible.</p>\n<p>Then, you also need to make sure the software you use most often will work. As High Sierra’s ship date approaches, developers may release updates to ensure compatibility.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0078-0172/474874-1-eng-US/f0078-012.jpg\" width=\"754\" height=\"434\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0078-01\" title=\"f0078-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>Check the Mac App Store on a regular basis to install updates on apps you have bought there. (To do this in the Mac App Store app, click on the Updates tab. This will check the store for any updates.)</p>\n<p>If you have software you didn’t get in the Mac App Store, launch the app and look in its preferences or other menus for an option to check for updates. You can also look on the developer’s website.</p>\n<p>Make a backup of your Mac before you install High Sierra. You might even save your important documents separately from your primary backup, just in case. If you install High Sierra and encounter problems, you can revert back using the backup.</p>\n<p><b>How do I install macOS High Sierra?</b> After you download High Sierra from the App Store, there are several ways to run the installation.</p>\n<p>&gt; Go to the High Sierra product page in the Mac App Store. The Download button will be replaced by an Open button. Click on it to start the installation.</p>\n<p>&gt; In the Mac App Store app, click on the Purchased tab. You should see the macOS High Sierra installer in the list of purchased apps. Click on the Install button.</p>\n<p>&gt; Go to your Applications folder and look for an app called “Install macOS High Sierra” and double-click on it.</p>\n","layout":{"landscape":{"id":"am-landscape-29","link":"feature_03-l.twig"},"portrait":{"id":"am-portrait-29","link":"feature_03.twig"}},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":1,"link_source":"","competition":[],"flatplan_title":"","notes":"","gutter_credit":"","other":"","image":[{"id":"4ef039be11c943ae1d453217f7745317","name":"sierra","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/sierra/477425-1-eng-US/sierra.jpg?t=story_img_size_768x0&ext/sierra_story_img_size_768x0.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"2048","height":"1536","legacy_id":"32128","is_default":true},{"id":"4ef039be11c943ae1d453217f7745317","name":"sierra","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/sierra/477425-1-eng-US/sierra.jpg?t=story_img_size_768x0&ext/sierra_story_img_size_768x0.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"2048","height":"1536","legacy_id":"32128","is_default":false}],"related_objects":{"image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_4_1497545511.7349","name":"f0078-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0078-0172/474874-1-eng-US/f0078-012.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"754","height":"434","legacy_id":"31907"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_4_1497545511.7349","name":"f0078-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0078-0172/474874-1-eng-US/f0078-012.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"754","height":"434","legacy_id":"31907"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_3_1497545512.388","name":"f0076-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0076-0172/474881-1-eng-US/f0076-012.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"980","height":"412","legacy_id":"31908"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_3_1497545512.388","name":"f0076-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0076-0172/474881-1-eng-US/f0076-012.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"980","height":"412","legacy_id":"31908"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_2_1497545513.0113","name":"f0075-01","source":"","caption":"<p><b>Metal
