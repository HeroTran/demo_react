If you fit that bill and haven’t booted your Windows system since mid?March or you didn’t receive or install Microsoft’s vital security update (MS17?010) released at that time, read on. It’s critical that you don’t start up a Windows XP or later installation that’s unpatched and let it connect to the Internet unless you’re absolutely sure you have the SMB file-sharing service disabled or firewall or network-monitoring software installed that will block any attempt from an outside connection.</p>\n<p>Also, if you use Windows XP or a few later releases of Windows that are past Microsoft’s end of support since mid-March, you wouldn’t have received the security updates that Microsoft was reserving only for corporate subscribers <a href=\"http://go.macworld.com/corp\" target=\"_self\">until mid-May</a>. At that point, it made these updates generally available. If you booted any of those systems between mid-March and mid-May, you’re unprotected as well.</p>\n<p>If your Mac is on a network that uses NAT and DHCP to provide private IP addresses, which is most home networks and most small-office ones, and your router isn’t set up to connect the SMB file service from outside the local private network to your computer (whether Boot Camp or a VM), then the WannaCrypt worm can only attack your system from other computers on the same network. If they’re already patched or there are no other Windows instances of any kind, you can boot up the system, disable SMBv1, and apply the patches.</p>\n<p>If you don’t want to take that chance or you have a system that can be reached from the greater Internet directly through whatever method (a routable IP or router port mapping to your Mac), you should disable networking on your computer before restarting into Boot Camp or launching a VM. This is easy with ethernet, but if you’re using Wi-Fi for your Windows instance, you need to unplug your network from the Internet.</p>\n<p>After booting, disable SMBv1. This prevents the worm from reaching your computer, no matter where it is. Microsoft offers instructions for Windows 7 and later at this <a href=\"http://go.macworld.com/supp\" target=\"_self\">support note</a>. If you have a Windows XP system, the process requires directly editing the Registry, and you will want to install firewall software to prevent incoming connections to SMB (port 445) before proceeding. The firewall approach is a good additional method for any Windows instance.</p>\n<p>Once you’ve either disabled SMBv1 or have a firewall in place, you can enable network access and install all the patches required for your release, including MS17-010.</p>\n<p>In some cases, you no longer need SMBv1, already known to be problematic, and can leave it disabled. If for legacy reasons you have to re-enable it, make sure you have both networking monitoring and firewall software (separately or a single app) that prevents unwanted and unexpected SMB access.</p>\n<p class=\"pullQuote\">After booting, disable SMBv1.

Many of them are designed for freelancers who need to track billable time so they can invoice clients, but others track activity on your Mac, so you can know where your day has gone. <a href=\"http://timingapp.com\" target=\"_self\">Timing</a> ($29, $49, or $79) combines both of these features, allowing you to easily start and stop projects, to know how much to bill, and also see which apps you use, and which websites you visit.</p>\n<p>For many people, this latter feature is a novelty; you can see exactly how much time you spend on Facebook or Twitter, for example. But some professionals may bill time spent in a specific app or on a specific website for their clients. If this is the case, Timing can automatically add up all that time, so you don’t even need to tell the app when you’ve started working on a project and when you’ve finished.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0084-0170/474967-1-eng-US/f0084-012.jpg\" width=\"787\" height=\"502\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0084-01\" title=\"f0084-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>Here’s Timing showing what I did on one day.</b></p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>Timing displays lots of information; in some cases, a bit too much. It takes a while to get used to this app, and fortunately the developer has a good deal of help on his website, as well as a fiveday email course you can sign up for.</p>\n<p>You can see a number of sections below, such as the timeline of the day’s activity, and two graphs showing Projects &amp; Tasks and Apps. There’s also a productivity score section, which calculates how much of your time is useful, based on ratings you set by project.</p>\n<p>While the app records all this data, and assigns it automatically—if you don’t create your own projects and start tracking a specific project—that information isn’t entirely valid. For example, I spent 1:32 browsing the web on the day in the screenshot below; but much of that web browsing was research for what I was writing. I could go to the Review tab and manually apply specific websites to my Writing project, or manually start and stop the project when I’m writing, but if I’m not actively tracking a project, I won’t do this. It also counted time when Safari was the frontmost window, but when I may have been on the phone or making tea.</p>\n<p class=\"pullQuote\">You can tell Timing that any activity with a specific app is part of a given project; you can also set websites, and even folders on your Mac containing files you work on for clients, so they, too, are counted in projects.</p>\n<p>The Review tab is where you tell Timing what your projects are, and which apps, websites, and files you use for them. You can tell Timing that any activity with a specific app is part of a given project; you can also set websites, and even folders on your Mac containing files you work on for clients, so they, too, are counted in projects.</p>\n<p>The Details tab breaks down each hour, showing exactly what you did, when, and for how long. Again, you can use this data to refine projects, or simply to see what you have been doing all day.</p>\n<p>You can export reports in Excel, CVS, or HTML, and print them or create PDFs. You may be able to import these reports to your accounting appto then bill clients.</p>\n<p>The pricing model is a bit arcane. With three levels (Productivity, Professional, and Expert) it’s hard to know which one is right. And while this isn’t technically subscription pricing, each one only offers free updates for 12 months, and each offers a different number of computers the app can be used on (two, three, or five).</p>\n<p>I already have a time tracking feature in the accounting software I use <a href=\"http://go.macworld.com/fa\" target=\"_self\">FreeAgent</a>, and it cannot import data from Timing or other apps, but if I didn’t have that feature, I’d certainly use Timing to track those tasks where I bill clients. Otherwise, it’s interesting to see what I do all day, and how much of my work is unproductive.</p>\n<h3><b>BOTTOM LINE</b></h3><p>If you’re a freelancer billing clients, you should check out Timing. If not, you may still want to try the app just to get a better idea of how you spend your time.</p>\n\n<div>\n<table bgcolor=\"#eeeeee\">\n<tr>\n    <td>\n    <h3><b>TIMING 2.0</b></h3>\n<div

more bandwidth than the twisted-pair cable that DSL service relies on. And the cable companies will happily rent you the equipment you need, on top of the fee they charge you for internet service. But they can’t force you to use their equipment, so router manufacturers are building cable modems you can purchase. Linksys jumped into that market today with its CG7500, a two-in-one DOCSIS 3.0 cable modem/router.</p>\n<p>DOCSIS (Data Over Cable Service Interface Specification) is the standard that enables existing cable-TV systems to carry data in addition to TV programming. Being a DOCSIS 3.0 device, Linksys says its CG7500 is compatible with broadband packages offering download speeds up to 300Mbps. If your cable company is delivering faster speeds, you’ll want to look at a modem based on the newer DOCSIS 3.1 standard. The Xfinity xFi cable modem that Comcast <a href=\"http://go.macworld.com/xfi\" target=\"_self\">announced recently</a>, for example, is a DOCSIS 3.1 device that can accommodate broadband service with download speeds of up to 1Gbps.</p>\n<p>The Linksys CG7500 also incorporates a dual-band AC1900 Wi-Fi router in the same enclosure to deliver throughput up to 600Mbps on the 2.4GHz frequency band and 1,300Mbps on the 5GHz band. The gateway has a four-port gigabit switch and a USB 2.0 port. Linksys says its cable modem is priced at $199.97 and is available now. Based on a rental fee of $10 per month, it should pay for itself in about 20 months.</p>\n<h3><b>LINKSYS MAX-STREAM EA9300 TRI-BAND ROUTER</b></h3><p>Linksys is also filling in the middle of its Max-Stream series of tri-band routers: The $300 EA9300 is an AC4000 model that is now bookended by the entry-level EA8300 (an AC2200 model that sells for $200) and the high-end EA9500 (an AC5400 model that sells for $400). All three models operate one wireless network on the 2.4GHz frequency band and two independent networks on the 5GHz band, with an auto-steering feature that automatically assigns 5GHz clients to the most appropriate network to balance the router’s load. They also support multi-user MIMO (MU-MIMO, a technology we explain <a href=\"http://go.macworld.com/mimo\" target=\"_self\">in depth here</a>).</p>\n<p>The EA9300 delivers wireless throughput of up to 750Mbs on the 2.4GHz band, up to 1,625Mbps on the lower channels in the 5GHz frequency band, and up to 1,625Mbps on the upper 5GHz channels. A “seamless roaming” feature offers mesh-like performance when the router is deployed alongside a Linksys RE7000 range extender: The router and the range extender use the same SSID and client devices are automatically passed back and forth without any connectivity interruptions.</p>\n<p>Linksys promises that an upcoming firmware update will introduce several new features including “dual WAN,” which will aggregate the bandwidth of two broadband connections to provide internet bandwidth in excess of 1Gbps; link aggregation to support file-transfer speeds up to 2Gbps; and dynamic frequency selection, which will provide up to four times the wireless channels available on the 5GHz frequency band.</p>\n<p>Linksys says the EA9300 should be available now.</p>\n","layout":{"landscape":{"id":"am-landscape-19","link":"workingmac_02-l.twig"},"portrait":{"id":"am-portrait-19","link":"workingmac_02.twig"}},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":1,"link_source":"","competition":[],"flatplan_title":"","notes":"","gutter_credit":"","other":"","image":[{"id":"2847c64a018f4d0c68fb8e21ea62b1e2","name":"linksys","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/linksys/477480-1-eng-US/linksys.jpg?t=story_img_size_768x0&ext/linksys_story_img_size_768x0.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"1300","height":"950","legacy_id":"32132","is_default":true},{"id":"2847c64a018f4d0c68fb8e21ea62b1e2","name":"linksys","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/linksys/477480-1-eng-US/linksys.jpg?t=story_img_size_768x0&ext/linksys_story_img_size_768x0.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"1300","height":"950","legacy_id":"32132","is_default":false}],"related_objects":{"image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1497545520.4274","name":"f0086-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0086-0168/475003-1-eng-US/f0086-012.jpg?t=story_img_size_768x0&ext/f0086-012_story_img_size_768x0.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"733","height":"479","legacy_id":"31922"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1497545520.4274","name":"f0086-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0086-0168/475003-1-eng-US/f0086-012.jpg?t=story_img_size_768x0&ext/f0086-012_story_img_size_768x0.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"733","height":"479","legacy_id":"31922"}]},"url_alias":"http://macworld-us.audiencemedia.com","type":"story","order":"20","folio_number":"86","folio_numbers":"86,87","pdf_page_index":"86","thumbnail":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/linksys/477480-1-eng-US/linksys.jpg?t=tablet_story_thumbnail&ext/linksys_tablet_story_thumbnail.jpg","color":"2699cd","real_id":"31921","main_section_id":"1730","ads":[]},{"id":"zinio_285_100340926_1497545521.7001","title":"Digit review: Online account service needs better controls","sub_title":"","author":[{"id":"0","name":"JEFFERY BATTERSBY","email":"noreply@audiencemedia.com","is_default":false}],"tag":"","strap_line":"Digit","intro":"Digit is a service that builds savings by automatically withdrawing from your checking account.

As it stands she’s a pretty good saver all on her own, but the idea of an app that would monitor her bank account, watch for spending patterns, and find savings where she didn’t see them seemed like a great idea to her. So, I signed myself up to see how it works. There’s a lot of value in this app, but at present it lacks refinement and the kind of granular control you really want in an app that’s trying to save you money.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0089-0149/475053-1-eng-US/f0089-012.jpg\" width=\"642\" height=\"737\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0089-01\" title=\"f0089-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>Connect Digit to an existing account, and the service automatically withdraws money from that account and puts it into a Digit savings account.</b></p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>The idea behind Digit is pretty simple and it’s similar to the way you save pocket change in a jar, only with more intelligence. Digit is designed to link to one of your bank accounts, watch it for a little bit of time to learn your spending and deposit patterns, and then begin transferring money from your attached account to a private FDIC insured Digit account. And, like the pocket change you drop in a jar at the end of the day, it should make the saving almost unnoticeable.</p>\n<p>After creating a Digit account you need to link an existing bank account for the app to start watching. Digit connects to a very limited but growing number of banks. I have three different banks I do business with, but Digit only let me connect to my Wells Fargo account. None of the other accounts were available, even though they’re large east coast institutions. Information on what banks Digit supports is non-existent on their website, but you can contact them directly via Twitter or email them at <a href=\"mailto:help@digit.co\" target=\"_self\">help@digit.co</a> and they’ll let you know whether or not your bank is supported.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0090-0156/475046-1-eng-US/f0090-012.jpg\" width=\"522\" height=\"562\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0090-01\" title=\"f0090-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>Digit has a mobile app that you can use to manage your Digit account.</b></p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>You interact with Digit with the Messages-like <a href=\"http://go.macworld.com/dartc\" target=\"_self\">Digit app</a> or with Messages itself using several specific text-based commands. Savings to see how much you’ve saved, Recent for recent transactions, Pause to temporarily pause automatically saving money, Save and a dollar amount to put a specific amount of money into your account.</p>\n<p>Digit’s money saving algorithm is curious. I usually keep between $400 and $1,400 in the account I linked to Digit. When I first started using the app it literally pulled pennies from my account. 17 cents, 22 cents, and 13 cents for the first three transactions. To boost my savings a bit I texted Save to Digit with a dollar amount and it added that much more to my Digit savings account.</p>\n<p>About two months in, Digit began to save whole dollar amounts, then Digit began making regular withdrawals of between $10 and $20 two to three times a week, draining my linked checking account balance to under $100 and $50?plus dollars a week was more aggressive than I was comfortable with.</p>\n\n<div>\n<table bgcolor=\"#eeeeee\">\n<tr>\n    <td>\n    <h3><b>DIGIT</b></h3>\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/2.5mice5/476252-1-eng-US/2.5mice.png\" width=\"197\" height=\"144\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"2.5mice\" title=\"2.5mice\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h4><b>PROS</b></h4><p>• Automatically saves money from your personal checking account based on your spending and deposit patterns.</p>\n<h4><b>CONS</b></h4><p>• Saves too aggresively.</p>\n<p>• Limited control over changing savings patterns.</p>\n<p>• Limited control over how your personal information is used.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n    </td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n</div><p>Looking at Digit’s Twitter feed it’s clear this is a common issue. Several people posted screenshots with similar complaints. So mine was not an isolated experience. Digit does offer features to help mitigate such a heavy drain on your bank account, including a guarantee not to overdraw your account—a feature you can only use twice. But when I texted Digit to Save less, I got a reply stating this wasn’t possible. The service has other similar limitations. Ask it to save $5 a week or $50 a month and you’ll find that isn’t possible either. But these are options that would make the app more valuable.</p>\n<p>Digit was free when I first began looking at the app. Mid-April the company announced they would begin charging $3 a month beginning at the end of July. I’m happy to pay for online services, particularly those services that have access to personal and financial information. Especially if that means my private information will be kept private. At present, according to Digit’s <a href=\"http://go.macworld.com/dapp\" target=\"_self\">privacy policy</a>, they use your information “...to offer our products and services and products and services of third parties that we think you might find of interest...”. Based on their current policy, you are what’s being marketed. It’s unclear whether that policy will change once Digit is converted to a paid service, but the current policy is enough for me to say no thanks.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0091-0143/475032-1-eng-US/f0091-012.jpg\" width=\"445\" height=\"791\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0091-01\" title=\"f0091-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p>Digit’s money saving algorithm is curious.
