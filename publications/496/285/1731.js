Available for Mac or PC (the license can be used on either platform), <a href=\"https://imazing.com\" target=\"_self\">iMazing</a> doesn’t sync files in the traditional sense, but rather acts as a conduit for transferring files between desktop computers and iPhone, iPad, or iPod devices.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0094-0143/475110-1-eng-US/f0094-012.jpg\" width=\"787\" height=\"477\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0094-01\" title=\"f0094-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>iMazing allows iOS device backups to be saved anywhere, but only Mac or PC formatted volumes work for archives.</b></p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>Think of iMazing as iTunes without media purchasing or playback, but a whole lot more versatile. iMazing also does many things Apple’s media player can only dream of, like exporting iMessage conversations. Annoyed by how iTunes saves device backups on your internal drive? With iMazing, you can store these enormous files anywhere you’d like, and browse archives with Time Machine–style simplicity. (Archives work on Mac- or PC-formatted volumes, not on network attached storage devices.)</p>\n<p>In addition to managing apps, photos, music, videos, notes, call logs, and voice memos, iMazing 2.2 adds the ability to transfer ebooks and PDF documents to iBooks. Better yet, photos can now be transferred from computer to iOS via drag-and-drop, although albums created this way can’t be deleted from the Photos app and won’t be included in backups.</p>\n<p>There are other limitations to be aware of. Certain data types including Messages, call history, voicemail, Contacts, and Notes can only be accessed from a backup, rather than the device itself. As a result, iMazing occasionally feels slower to use than iTunes. My personal pet peeve is how long the application takes to perform an initial scan of iCloud Photo Library thumbnails, although devices with fewer images won’t have this problem.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0095-0139/475103-1-eng-US/f0095-012.jpg\" width=\"930\" height=\"561\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0095-01\" title=\"f0095-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>iMazing can also access and export text messages, but only from an existing device backup.</b></p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>RESTORE AND TRANSFER</b></h3><p>One of iMazing’s coolest features is the ability to copy content between devices, quite handy for upgrading to a new iPhone or iPad. Rather than restore from iTunes or a lengthy iCloud backup, you simply connect both devices, start the transfer, and sit back while the software does its thing. It’s a more streamlined process that puts Apple’s cumbersome method to shame.</p>\n<p>iMazing 2.2 makes other welcome improvements to the traditionally frontloaded restore process. Rather than having to connect a new device via Wi-Fi to activate and update to the latest version of iOS, iMazing seamlessly handles these tasks as part of its restore wizard.</p>\n<p>You’ll endure fewer annoying iOS Setup Assistant screens during a restore, since the software automatically takes care of many account login prompts for you. (Signing in to install App Store updates is still required, however.) Similar conveniences extend to updating or reinstalling iOS itself. Since devices are always connected to the utility over Wi-Fi, iMazing detects when the current version is out of date and offers to update with a click.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0096-0159/475096-1-eng-US/f0096-012.jpg\" width=\"786\" height=\"475\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0096-01\" title=\"f0096-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>Restoring backups to a new device is easier thanks to iMazing’s one-click transfer wizard.</b></p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>You can also do the same with a complete reinstall, even during a restore. Although like iTunes, you won’t be able to downgrade to older iOS versions once Apple has stopped signing them. There are plenty of smaller improvements too, like a new preferences tab for Devices, with options to prevent iTunes from performing automatic backups or launching after connecting a device.</p>\n<h3><b>BOTTOM LINE</b></h3><p>Keep iTunes around for buying or playing media files, but when it comes to managing iOS devices and transferring media files, it doesn’t get much better than

converter can play virtually any type of high-resolution audio file, but its most compelling feature is its ability to decode MQA files.</p>\n<p>For me, MQA (Master Quality Authenticated) was <a href=\"http://go.macworld.com/mqa\" target=\"_self\">the best thing</a> to come out of CES 2015. Developed by Meridian Audio, a company with a long track record developing high-resolution audio technology, MQA makes it possible for consumers to hear music that’s not only better than CD quality, but the same quality that the artist heard when they recorded it in the studio. And the artist can attest to that because MQA files include a digital fingerprint that indicates the artist, recording engineer, or producer has verified that what you’re hearing was sourced from the studio master.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0098-0134/475167-1-eng-US/f0098-012.jpg\" width=\"377\" height=\"464\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0098-01\" title=\"f0098-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>The line-level output (left) has a rubber plug in it so you don’t mistakenly plug your headphones into it.</b></p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>What’s even better is that the MQA files come in small packages that are easy to stream. You’ll need hardware that’s capable of decoding MQA to benefit from it, though, and the Explorer2 is one of the least-expensive devices available (Amazon is selling it for <a href=\"http://go.macworld.com/ex2\" target=\"_self\">$199</a>). The Explorer2 plugs into your computer’s USB port using the provided, but somewhat archaic, USB mini (not micro) cable. Windows users will need to install a driver.</p>\n<p>Most people will use this DAC with headphones, which is how I reviewed it, but it can also be paired with an outboard preamp. It has two 3.5mm analog outputs: There’s a variable-level output for use with headphones, and a second fixed-level output for use with outboard equipment. There’s a rubber plug in the second output so that you don’t inadvertently plug your headphones into it.</p>\n<p>The Explorer2 has no volume control of its own, so you’ll need to use your computer (or an app running on your computer, or an outboard amp) to do that. I listened to the Explorer2 with a wide variety of headphones, including Blue Microphones’ <a href=\"http://go.macworld.com/bm\" target=\"_self\">Mo-Fi</a>, Bowers &amp; Wilkins <a href=\"http://go.macworld.com/p5\" target=\"_self\">P5</a>, and Ultrasone ProLine 750 headphones, as well as a pair of custom-fit JH Audio JH13 Pro in-ear monitors.</p>\n<p>I tested the DAC with a desktop PC running Windows 10 as well as an iMac. I listened to various high-resolution audio tracks (24-bit/48kHz and 24-bit/96kHz FLAC files) as well as numerous tracks encoded with MQA, both downloaded and streamed from <a href=\"http://tidal.com/us\" target=\"_self\">Tidal</a>. (You need to subscribe to the HiFi service level at $19.99 per month <i>and</i> use Tidal’s desktop app to listen to MQA streams. Tidal’s web and mobile apps can’t currently stream MQA tracks.) Tidal also offers FLAC-encoded versions of MQAencoded albums, which made it easier for me to conduct A/B listening tests.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0099-0129/475160-1-eng-US/f0099-012.jpg\" width=\"927\" height=\"611\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0099-01\" title=\"f0099-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>I evaluated the Explorer2 with a variety of headphones, including (from left to right) Bowers &amp; Wilkins P5 mobile headphones, JH Audio’s JH13 Pro in-ear monitors, and Blue Microphones’ self-amplified Mo-Fi (with the amp turned off).</b></p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>LISTENING TESTS</b></h3><p>The biggest downside of any new format is having to re-buy all your favorite music to benefit from the technology advance. A streaming service eliminates that barrier to entry—provided you don’t mind not owning your music. If I were banished to a deserted island and allowed to bring one album with me, I’d take Steely Dan’s <i>Aja</i>. I had to settle for the band’s 2000 reunion album <i>Two Against Nature</i>, streamed from Tidal HiFi, for my MQA listening test, as that’s the only album in the band’s catalog that’s been remastered in MQA to date. Fortunately, the band doesn’t have a bad album in its catalog, so I wasn’t too disappointed, but it’s problematic that MQA isn’t already more ubiquitous.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0100-0144/475153-1-eng-US/f0100-012.jpg\" width=\"787\" height=\"354\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0100-01\" title=\"f0100-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>The blue LED indicates that the Explorer2 is decoding an MQA Studio track</b></p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p class=\"pullQuote\">The company has deals with all three of the major record labels—Sony, Warner Music Group, and Universal Music Group—as well as Merlin, a digital rights agency</p>\n<p>The company has deals with all three of the major record labels—Sony, Warner Music Group, and Universal Music Group— as well as Merlin, a digital rights agency representing more than 20,000 independent record labels. But that doesn’t mean those companies’ entire libraries are available in MQA format today. All that music must be remastered re-encoded to gain the benefits that MQA offers, and some labels are taking the opportunity to remaster albums as well. But the labels that have signed up with MQA are also making new albums—such as Sheryl Crow’s <i>Be Myself</i>, Gorillaz’ <i>Humanz</i>, Beyoncé’s <i>Lemonade</i>, and the Neko Case, K.D. Lang, Laura Veirs collaboration <i>Case/ Lang/Veirs</i>—available in MQA format. On Tidal, at least. I couldn’t find any of those albums available for purchase as a digital download in MQA format.</p>\n<p>The sonic improvements I heard in the MQA tracks were much subtler than what I recall from the CES demo more than two years ago. Whether that’s due to my faulty memory, lower-end headphones, or just the passage of time I can’t say. I still preferred the MQA tracks, but I wasn’t as bowled over as I was back then. The improvements manifest themselves in many ways, but mostly in definition. The vocals, instruments, and percussion were much more distinct in the MQA versions.</p>\n<p>On Steely Dan’s “What a Shame About Me,” from <i>Two Against Nature</i>, for example, you can pick out the drummer very quietly riding the cymbal, an element that’s all but missing from the FLAC version I ripped and encoded from the CD. Individual notes of all the instruments decay more naturally in the MQA version, whereas they drop out rather abruptly on the FLAC version. This was also particularly evident with the conga drums and tenor sax that open the title track.</p>\n<p>You don’t need to sign up for Tidal to get the most from the Explorer2, because the DAC can decode many other codecs in addition to MQA, at up to 24-bit resolution and 192kHz sampling rates. One thing the Explorer2 can’t do, however, is decode DSD files.</p>\n<p>The Explorer2 exhibited spectacular dynamic range with Eric Whitacre’s “Equus,” from <i>Water Night</i>, an album I acquired in 24-bit/96kHz format from Bowers &amp; Wilkins’ Society of Sound download service. Not a hint of detail was lost in the quieter passages, and every instrument was rendered clearly and distinctly in the louder sections. I wish I could have compared this recording to an MQA version, but there isn’t one available.</p>\n<h3><b>SHOULD YOU BUY ONE?</b></h3><p>With an asking price of $199, the Explorer2 is fantastic value. It delivers great audio performances with all types of digital music, and it’s one of the least-expensive ways to decode MQA tracks. If you’re a Tidal HiFi subscriber, it’s a total no-brainer. But even if MQA doesn’t take off and ends up being relegated to the backwater of audio-recording history, this DAC is a steal.</p>\n<p><i>Editor’s Note: QA’s PR agency reached out to us after this story was published to inform us that <a href=\"http://Nugs.net\" target=\"_self\">Nugs.net</a>, an online service offering recordings of live performances from bands on on tour, now offers MQA-encoded downloads.

At the top of the E-series lineup sits the E55BT wireless headphones. If you’re looking to grab some signature JBL sound for less than $150, these headphones might just be your ticket.</p>\n<p>Like all E-Series models, the E55BT comes in five bold monochromatic options: black, blue, red, teal, and white (my review pair happened to be red). Included accessories are Spartan. There’s a 3.5mm audio cable and a microUSB charging cable, but no carrying case or even a 1/4-inch adapter.</p>\n<p>The JBL E55BT is a circumaural, or over-the-ear, design. The headband is wrapped in a soft, two-tone cotton mesh, with the underside of the headband a darker color than the top. Sizing is adjustable in typical click-stop increments. I had no problems getting a good, snug fit.</p>\n<p>The E55BT’s ear pads are small compared to some other circumaural designs. My ears touched the sides when I wore them, and I would suspect that it would be the same with most adults. While the headphones were never uncomfortable, I raise the issue because some folks tend to be more sensitive to this issue than others.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0103-0140/475238-1-eng-US/f0103-012.jpg\" width=\"767\" height=\"496\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0103-01\" title=\"f0103-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>The two-tone headband is wrapped in a soft mesh.</b></p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>SURPRISINGLY COMPACT AND PORTABLE</b></h3><p>When I first picked them up, I noted how light E55BT are. That must be due, in part, to the all-plastic ear cups. Even though my review pair emerged unscathed, the all-plastic shell did give me the impression that these headphones might crack if dropped onto a hard surface or subjected to a fair amount of abuse.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0104-0138/475231-1-eng-US/f0104-012.jpg\" width=\"597\" height=\"435\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0104-01\" title=\"f0104-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>The right ear cup has various controls and the power switch.</b></p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>When you put them on, you tend to forget you’re wearing headphones. Their light weight makes them great for toting along just about anywhere. But their folding options take portability even further.</p>\n<p>You can fold these JBLs in two different ways—something that’s highly unusual in an over-the-ear headphone. You can twist the ear cups flat to slide them into a backpack or sleeve; or, like the V-Moda <a href=\"http://go.macworld.com/cf2\" target=\"_self\">Crossfade 2 Wireless</a>, you can fold the E55BT ear cups fully into the headband for an ultra-portable form factor.</p>\n<p>The E55BT’s ear pads themselves are made of a synthetic leather. It’s soft but with extended listening, they will get warm.</p>\n<p>The ear cups’ inner side tell you which one is left or right. The outside are boldly branded with the JBL logo, while the rounded sides house traditional controls. The bottom of the left ear cup has a MicroUSB charging input. JBL says you can get up to 20 hours of playing time.</p>\n<p>The right ear cup has a power switch, 3.5mm input, microphone, inline remote controls, and a Bluetooth pairing button. You can use the included 3.5mm cable if you want to use the headphones passively. There’s no lightning cable for iPhone 7 models, so you’ll need to use a lightning-to-3.5mm adapter.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0105-0135/475224-1-eng-US/f0105-012.jpg\" width=\"927\" height=\"621\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0105-01\" title=\"f0105-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>You can plug in a 3.5mm cable to run the headphones passively.

Pressing and holding the volume up or volume down will advance or rewind a song. I found this functionality to be awkward; if I didn’t hold the button down long enough, all I’d do is adjust the volume.</p>\n<p>If you clasp the ear cup with your right hand, you’ll almost always land right on the play/pause button. Apple users take note: with an iPhone 7, I could not engage Siri remotely from the headphones by depressing the play/pause button like you can with many other headphones.</p>\n<p>To me, the ear cup-situated controls felt a bit cheap. From a design perspective, I wish that there was better tactile distinction between the three control buttons. Even though the play/pause button is slightly elevated to give you a point of reference, I never had complete confidence I was pressing the correct button; and on a few occasions, I raised or lowered the volume when I simply wanted to pause a song.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0106-0139/475217-1-eng-US/f0106-012.jpg\" width=\"787\" height=\"569\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0106-01\" title=\"f0106-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>The inside of the ear cups let you know which is right and left.</b></p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>FLAWLESS BLUETOOTH PERFORMANCE</b></h3><p>Bluetooth pairing is simple and flawless. The only thing to note is that the E55BT does not support either the aptX or aptX HD codec. So, when streaming via Bluetooth, you should expect less-than CD quality.</p>\n<p>A selling feature of the JBL E55BT is its ability to be paired with multiple Bluetooth devices. When you turn on the E55BT it will auto-pair with previously-paired Bluetooth devices in range.</p>\n<p>While that isn’t necessarily unique, I did find that switching between Bluetooth devices was lightning fast and pretty much flawless. For example, I was able to pair the JBL E55BT with a MacBook Pro and iPhone 7 simultaneously. Choosing songs from the iPhone immediately played them on the JBL. If I paused the iPhone’s audio and played media from the Mac, the audio from the Mac would then play through the JBLs without issue.</p>\n<p>You need not worry about one device trouncing another. If, for example, I was watching a video on the Mac and then started playing music on the iPhone with the JBL paired to both, I’d only get the audio of the Mac—even though the iPhone continued playing while paired with the E55BT. Once I quit the application on the Mac, the iPhone audio would then kick right in exactly as I’d expect. Not only was this feature flawless in my testing, but the E55BT also responded relatively quickly when auto-switching between sources.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0107-0135/475210-1-eng-US/f0107-012.jpg\" width=\"719\" height=\"515\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0107-01\" title=\"f0107-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>Included accessories are a microUSB charging cable and a 3.5mm cable.

To give you a hint, when you turn on the E55BT. they generate the same characteristic chords as JBL’s other Bluetooth speakers.</p>\n<p>The E55BT’s often sound like the have a euphonic bump in the upper bass that adds a bit of extra oomph to your music. It works very well with many songs, including Adele’s “Send My Love (To Your New Lover)” from 25.</p>\n<p>Unlike some other headphones I’ve reviewed, the bump is smartly implemented and doesn’t extend across all bass frequencies to muddy up the overall musical presentation. For example, many headphones I’ve reviewed will get sloppy with Alanis Morissette’s “Woman Down” from <i>Havoc and Bright Lights</i>. Not the B55BT’s. I also fired up Sarah McLachlan’s “Perfect Girl” from <i>Afterglow Live</i>, and the deep synthesizer bass lines never rumbled out of control. At the same time, the E55BT’s weren’t capable of reproducing tight, visceral bass the way more expensive headphones can. If you consider yourself a bass-head or like headphones that over-emphasize bass, then the E55BTs won’t be your cup of tea.</p>\n<p>I lived with and listened to the V-Moda Crossfade 2 Wireless on an almost daily basis for months to prep for that review. So, when I switched to the JBL E55BT for this review, some of the E55BT’s contrasting sonic characteristics immediately jumped out.</p>\n<p>The soundstage is larger and more relaxed on the E55BT. Consequently, you get a greater sense of space. I loved this characteristic on live albums, like the Eagles’ <i>Hell Freezes Over</i> and on choral works like Lycourgos Angelopoulos and the Greek Byzantine Choir’s recording of the <i>Byzantine Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom</i>. Vocals also tend to sit further back in the soundstage and take a back seat to bass-dominant instruments, which are more forward. I didn’t notice this on every track I played, but that track-dependent characteristic will likely pop up from time to time.</p>\n<p>The E55BT aren’t the last word in transparency or rendering fine sonic details at the top end but I don’t think the average consumer will really mind. The headphones deliver a very clean, wellbalanced sound.</p>\n<h3><b>PUT THESE ON YOUR SHORT LIST</b></h3><p>Lately, I’ve reviewed several headphones costing double or triple the JBL’s price. To say that these modestly priced JBL headphones surprised me would be an understatement. With their ultra-compact form factor (for a circumaural headphone) and light weight, they are a perfect travel companion. The only downer is that you’ll need to provide a carrying case or some other protection, so the all-plastic ear cups don’t get damaged.</p>\n<p>With excellent wireless performance and battery life and really good sound, JBL’s E55BT headphones are a real winner. If you tend to like the sound of JBL’s other products then I think you’ll love the E55BT’s. In fact, regardless of your listening preferences, if you’re auditioning headphones under $200, you’d be silly not to include the E55BTs on your short list.</p>\n\n<div>\n<table bgcolor=\"#eeeeee\">\n<tr>\n    <td>\n    <h3><b>JBL E55BT</b></h3>\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/4mice26/476273-1-eng-US/4mice.png\" width=\"289\" height=\"144\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"4mice\" title=\"4mice\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h4><b>AT A GLANCE</b></h4><p>At this price, you won’t be disappointed by the JBL E55BT’s sound or its feature sets.</p>\n<h4><b>PROS</b></h4><p>• Very good audio performance for the price.</p>\n<p>• Lightweight and ultra compact when folded.</p>\n<p>• Flawless multi-device Bluetooth pairing.</p>\n<h4><b>CONS</b></h4><p>• Remote control functionality can be awkward.</p>\n<p>• No Siri, aptX, or aptX HD support.</p>\n<p>• No carrying case or travel pouch.</p>\n<h4><b>PRICE</b></h4><p>$119</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n    </td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n</div>","layout":{"landscape":{"id":"am-landscape-26","link":"playlist_article_02-l.twig"},"portrait":{"id":"am-portrait-26","link":"playlist_article_02.twig"}},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":1,"link_source":"","competition":[],"flatplan_title":"","notes":"","gutter_credit":"","other":"","image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1497545540.1757","name":"f0102-01","source":"IMAGE: JBL/HARMON","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0102-0141/475245-1-eng-US/f0102-012.jpg?t=story_img_size_768x0&ext/f0102-012_story_img_size_768x0.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"975","height":"614","legacy_id":"31952","is_default":true},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1497545540.1757","name":"f0102-01","source":"IMAGE: JBL/HARMON","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0102-0141/475245-1-eng-US/f0102-012.jpg?t=story_img_size_768x0&ext/f0102-012_story_img_size_768x0.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"975","height":"614","legacy_id":"31952","is_default":false}],"related_objects":{"image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_6_1497545535.767","name":"f0108-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0108-0138/475203-1-eng-US/f0108-012.jpg?t=story_img_size_768x0&ext/f0108-012_story_img_size_768x0.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"55","height":"27","legacy_id":"31946"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_6_1497545535.767","name":"f0108-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0108-0138/475203-1-eng-US/f0108-012.jpg?t=story_img_size_768x0&ext/f0108-012_story_img_size_768x0.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"55","height":"27","legacy_id":"31946"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_5_1497545536.358","name":"f0107-01","source":"","caption":"<p><b>Included accessories are a microUSB charging cable and a 3.5mm cable.
