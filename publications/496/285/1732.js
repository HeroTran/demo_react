However, Corey found that while people with access to the library can tap Like in iOS, there’s no way to sort the images or create a smart album in Photos for macOS. The likes don’t even show up! Corey wondered if they were missing something?</p>\n<p>You’re missing nothing: Photos for iOS and macOS have slightly different features, and shared albums lack options that would let you reduce or sort the set.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0112-0135/475309-1-eng-US/f0112-012.jpg\" width=\"377\" height=\"646\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0112-01\" title=\"f0112-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>You can Like an image in a iCloud shared album and iCloud counts the number of likes, but this isn’t available on a Mac and doesn’t show there.</b></p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>In Photos for iOS and macOS, you can view an image or video in the regular (not shared) collection, and tap a heart button (or press the period button in macOS) and the image is marked as Added To Favorites. When you create a smart album in macOS, you can use that, as Corey notes, as one of the parameters. I use this all the time to create sets as Corey does of the best images from a larger set.</p>\n<p>However, macOS doesn’t offer a heart button for media in shared albums. In iOS, there’s a Like link (as the literal text <i>Like</i>), which isn’t synced to macOS, and is neither viewable nor settable when visiting the album via a website. What good does Like do? It feels like a half implemented feature.</p>\n<p>Because Photos for iOS lacks some macOS features, you can’t make smart albums at all (though you can view them), and you can’t use Like as a criteria to sort, either. You also can’t see a total number of Likes or other details in Photos for iOS. What good is it? No idea.</p>\n<p>My low-tech suggestion is to do a rapid-fire slideshow with family in Photos for macOS, and mark those that are collective favorites, and then use a smart album to collect them, select them, and create a shared album from that.</p>\n<p>Ostensibly, Apple could fix feature and status synchronization in a future update to Photos on both platforms and to the <a href=\"http://iCloud.com\" target=\"_self\">iCloud.com</a> version.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0113-0135/475302-1-eng-US/f0113-012.jpg\" width=\"445\" height=\"272\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0113-01\" title=\"f0113-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>Apple lets you opt to avoid iOS and macOS authentication for a login by using a text message or an automated voice call.</b></p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>Can Windows be used with Apple’s two-factor authentication?</b></h3><p>Reader Sandie has an iPad and a Windows 10 system, and wondered how to use Apple’s two-factor authentication (2FA) with that setup. Apple doesn’t offer 2FA tools under Windows, but you don’t need a Mac or a second iOS device to get the advantages.</p>\n<p>Setting up 2FA on a single device is relatively easy, because the assumption is that you don’t have a second device ready yet, and you can validate yourself through a code sent via text message or read aloud to you by a computer-generated voice on a call placed to a phone number you provide.</p>\n<p>After that, any attempt to log in to an account on an iOS or macOS device that isn’t yet trusted (or hasn’t been recently validated) results in a location dialog on all of your iOS and macOS devices that are linked to the same Apple ID asking you to allow or reject the authentication request.</p>\n<p>Apple lets you opt to avoid iOS and macOS authentication for a login by using a text message or an automated voice call.</p>\n<p>But you can also bypass that. With a Web login, for instance, you can click or tap the Didn’t Get A Verification Link. That allows you to select Text Me or Use Phone Number (depending on whether you’ve verified SMS or a voice number or both) and have the code delivered that way.</p>\n<p>Now if you want additional insurance that you won’t lock yourself out if you lose your iOS device and access to your phone number at the same time (say by losing your phone or having it stolen), use the 2FA setup section at the <a href=\"http://go.macworld.com/aid\" target=\"_self\">Apple ID website</a> to add other trusted phone numbers, such as a spouse, partner, family member, or close friend. Follow these steps:</p>\n<p><b>1</b>. After logging in to <a href=\"http://appleid.apple.com\" target=\"_self\">appleid.apple.com</a>, click the Edit button at the far right of the Security section.</p>\n<p><b>2</b>. Click Add A Trusted Number<i>.</i></p>\n<p><b>3</b>. Enter the number and select whether it can receive an SMS or voice call.</p>\n<p><b>4</b>. Click Continue. Apple texts or calls you with the code.</p>\n<p><b>5</b>. Enter that code and click Verify.</p>\n<p>Add an additional trusted phone number (or multiple) to avoid a single device providing all your account verification with 2FA.</p>\n<p>That number is now another method you can use in case your others aren’t available. (It’s also a weak point: if someone gets your password and can access one of these phone numbers that is less under your control, they can break into your account.)</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_496/storage/images/media2/images/f0114-0141/475295-1-eng-US/f0114-012.jpg\" width=\"378\" height=\"294\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0114-01\" title=\"f0114-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>Add an additional trusted phone number (or multiple) to avoid a single device providing all your account verification with 2FA.</b></p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>You can also paradoxically use a trusted device to log in on a trusted device, again typically for a Web login.

However, in iOS, you can choose how far back events synchronize. In Settings → Calendar → Sync, you can pick either all events or a duration back two weeks, one month, three months, or six months.</p>\n<p>Apple offers no support notes on this, nor, in my testing, can I figure out if it relates to just syncing these events once or when past events change.</p>\n<p>What I suspect happened to Elliot is that his iPhone is set to Events 2 Weeks Back, which appears to be the default, and thus when he made the change to his Mac after two weeks away, those older events never synced back. Changing the setting in iOS should propagate those changes.</p>\n<h3><b>Ask Mac 911</b></h3><p>We’ve compiled a list of the most commonly asked questions we get, and the answers to them: <a href=\"http://go.macworld.com/mac911faq\" target=\"_self\">go.macworld.com/mac911faq</a> to see if you’re covered.
