<p>Apple’s collaboration with Nike has already produced a popular, breathable band for the Apple Watch, and now that same band style is available in several different colors. The $49 Day to Night collection is made up of bands that are, “inspired by a shade of the sky,” according to Nike. The four bands are available in colors that match the four colorways of the Air VaporMax Flyknit running shoe, in various shades of blue and purple. While Nike says that the new bands are for Apple Watch Nike+, there’s nothing about the new Day to Night bands that add functionality to the watch—you can pick one up regardless of the model of your Apple Watch.<b>—ROMAN LOYOLA</b></p>
