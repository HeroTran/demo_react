After that, use the device to get instant feedback from attendees in the form of polling, opinion surveys, or even quizzes, with results instantly available. Other features include the Picture Wall to allow the display of idea sketches, and a live blog to allow participants to comment on or ask questions of the presenter. Contact SwarmWorks to get a quote on the system price.</p>

    </div><h3><b>PENNA RETRO BLUETOOTH KEYBOARD</b></h3><p>We can’t help but be a bit delighted at the sight of the <a href="https://elretron.com/penna" target="_self">Penna Retro Bluetooth Keyboard</a> (starts at $114, with pledge through Indiegogo). This typewriter-style keyboard comes with either diamond-style keycaps or retro chrome keycaps— the macro bar on the left is even functional. While it’s functional, we just think it looks really cool. So do crowdfunders, who raised nearly 10 times the sum the makers needed to go into production.</p>
