    </div><p><b>T</b>he next version of Apple’s operating system for the Mac is called <a href="https://apple.co/2r3IGvn" target="_self">macOS High Sierra</a>. While the OS is mostly about software refinements, it also lays the foundation for future innovations in the worlds of VR (virtual reality) and AR (augmented reality).</p>
<p>You can learn more by taking a look at our favorite High Sierra features we list here. That’s followed by a FAQ, where you can get details on High Sierra’s release date, system requirements, installation instructions, and more.</p>
<h3><b>A NEW FILE SYSTEM</b></h3><p>Ever since System 8, the Mac has used the HFS+ file system to keep our documents and directories running smoothly, but at last year’s WWDC, a new <a href="http://go.macworld.com/apfs" target="_self">Apple File System</a> (APFS) was announced. It made it into iOS with the iOS <a href="http://go.macworld.com/103" target="_self">10.3 update</a>, and with High Sierra it’s also coming to the Mac. But where the changes to iOS are largely behind the scenes, you’ll really get to see it in action in the new macOS.</p>
<p>One of the main tenets of High Sierra, APFS will be the new default file system, bringing an advanced 64-bit architecture and a responsive design to cut down on the time it takes to do common tasks. Apple VP Craig Federighi quickly demoed how fast files are copied, and it should save quite a bit of time, even on older Macs. APFS also brings some heavy-duty security, including built?in encryption, crash?safe protections, and simplified data backup on the go.</p>
<h3><b>BETTER PHOTOS</b></h3><p>Photos is rapidly becoming one of the most used apps on our Macs, and in High Sierra it looks like we’ll be spending even more time with it. A slew of new features await us in the new OS, including better organization, looped Live Photos, and new Memories categories. It’ll also be easier to identify who’s in your photos with more accurate People identification and cross- device syncing for albums.</p>
<p>But the coolest feature may be a set of new built-in editing tools. Photos already lets us make some awesome adjustments to our snapshots, but High Sierra seriously ups the game with powerful pro-level tools—like a curves palette for fine-tuning color and contrast, a selective color dropper to hone a specific hue, and new filters that will make your photos fit for an art gallery. And for all your gallery- and album-worthy photos, Apple has now partnered with third-party apps to give you more publishing and printing options.</p>
<p class="pullQuote">A new system of intelligent tracking will use machine learning to identify prying advertising trackers that track your online behavior and remove the cross-site tracking data they leave behind.</p>
<h3><b>SPEEDIER, SMARTER SAFARI</b></h3><p>Apple’s browser always gets a tune-up whenever a new version of macOS comes out, but this time around Federighi says the improvements coming in High Sierra actually make it the world’s fastest desktop browser. It features 80 percent faster JavaScript performance when compared to Chrome, which should help us surf way quicker.</p>
<p>But we’re more interested in two new features that address what it’s like to use the Internet in 2017. The first will eliminate one of the more annoying features of the modern web: autoplay videos. Whereas Safari in Sierra tells you which tab is playing audio, in High Sierra, it will shut the video down before it can start. Autoplay blocking will detect which sites are delivering unwanted videos, and then press the pause button for you.</p>
<p>Along with our ears, the new Safari will also protect our privacy. A new system of intelligent tracking will use machine learning to identify prying advertising trackers that track your online behavior and remove the cross-site tracking data they leave behind. That means you won’t get hit up with three dozen vacuum ads the next time you buy one on Amazon.</p>
<h3><b>SMOOTHER VIDEO</b></h3><p>We watch a lot of video on our Macs, and High Sierra is making the experience even better. In addition to supporting 4K where available, it’s also upgrading to the new industry standard, High Efficiency Video Coding (or H.265 for short). The new system compresses video up to 40 percent more than H.264, the current video standard. Under the new codec, videos will stream smoother and take up less space, both of which will make the experience much more pleasant. And if you’re a video creator, the new standard will also be built into Pro Tools so your projects will be able to take full advantage of it right from the start.</p>

<p><b>Metal 2 will let developers create even more powerful games and apps.</b></p>

    </div><h3><b>NEXT-LEVEL METAL</b></h3><p>When Metal was introduced in <a href="http://go.macworld.com/ec" target="_self">El Capitan</a>, it brought a slew of under-the-hood changes to make games and graphics sing, and now it’s ready to deliver the next generation, appropriately called Metal 2. The new technology will open up games to a whole new world of power, with a new API and powerful tools for developers. Metal 2 will bring 10 times the draw call throughput that Metal delivered, enabling graphics that are far more robust while adding external GPU support for hard-core gamers.</p>
<p>But Metal 2 also brings support for something sorely missing from today’s Macs: virtual reality. High Sierra lets developers create interactive and immersive virtual reality experiences on the Mac for the very first time that will work with the HTC Vive and Unreal Engine for VR. And to show how serious it is about VR, Apple is even offering developers an external graphics dev kit to get started, featuring a Thunderbolt 3 enclosure with an AMD Radeon RX 580 GPU. You know, until the <a href="http://go.macworld.com/imp" target="_self">iMac Pro</a> arrives in December.</p>
<h3><b>OTHER FEATURES</b></h3><p>Since High Sierra is a maintenance release, there will be lots of little improvements all over your desktop that you might not even notice at first. In Mail, Search will now use Spotlight to quickly identify top hits, and you’ll be able to split your inbox and your compose window when you’re in full-screen view. You can add properly formatted tables to Notes and pin your most important ones. Siri has a more natural voice that sounds more like a person rather than a machine. And when you’re in a FaceTime call, you’ll be able to easily turn a special moment into a Live Photo so you can remember it forever.</p>

    </div><h3><b>MACOS HIGH SIERRA FAQ</b></h3><p><b>What is the name and version number of the new macOS?</b> Apple names its macOS versions after California locations. This time, it named the new version High Sierra. The name follows Apple’s pattern of slightly changing the name of the previous version of the OS if the upgrade isn’t considered a big one. (See for example, Leopard and then Snow Leopard, Lion and then Mountain Lion.)</p>
<p>Apple senior VP Craig Federighi joked during the <a href="http://go.macworld.com/wwk" target="_self">WWDC keynote</a> that the name could be “misconstrued,” but Federigi was reassured that the name High Sierra was “fully baked.”</p>
<p>If you’re into version numbers, then you’ll be happy to know that this one is version 10.13.</p>
<p><b>When will macOS High Sierra be released?</b></p>
<p>Apple, as usual, said macOS High Sierra will be released this fall. “Fall” has typically meant the end of October for macOS releases, so if you’re making plans, that’s the area of your calendar to target.</p>
<p><b>How much will macOS High Sierra cost?</b> Apple makes its operating systems free, so macOS High Sierra is a free upgrade for users who have macOS Sierra installed.</p>
<p class="pullQuote">If you are running Lion (version 10.7.5), Mountain Lion, Mavericks, Yosemite, or El Capitan, you can upgrade directly from one of those versions to Sierra.</p>
<p><b>From what operating systems can I upgrade to macOS High Sierra?</b> If you have macOS Sierra (the current macOS version), you can upgrade straight to High Sierra without doing any other software installations.</p>
<p>If you are running Lion (version 10.7.5), Mountain Lion, Mavericks, Yosemite, or El Capitan, you can upgrade directly from one of those versions to Sierra. Chances are this will still be the case with High Sierra.</p>
<p>If you are running Leopard, you need to upgrade to <a href="http://go.macworld.com/slf" target="_self">Snow Leopard first</a>, then upgrade to El Capitan, and then upgrade to High Sierra. If you want to upgrade from Snow Leopard, you need to upgrade to El Capitan, and then you can upgrade to High Sierra.</p>
<p><b>How do I get macOS High Sierra?</b> Apple will make the High Sierra upgrade available in the Mac App Store.</p>
<p><b>Can I try macOS High Sierra before it is released?</b> If you are a developer, you can get a beta of macOS Sierra through the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/programs/" target="_self">Apple Developer Program</a>. The developer beta is available now.</p>
<p>Apple will make a beta available to the general public in late June. Apple releases public betas on a regular cycle and the betas are free, but come with the caveat that the software isn’t as stable as it would be at release—meaning it could cause problems on your Mac. However, if you do decide to try the beta, you can provide Apple with valuable feedback. Sign up for the public beta program online at <a href="http://tinyurl.com/pffuwnz" target="_self">tinyurl.com/pffuwnz</a>.</p>
