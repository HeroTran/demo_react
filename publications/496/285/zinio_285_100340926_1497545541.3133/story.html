    </div><h3><b>Photos for iOS and macOS: The limits of liked photos</b></h3><p><b>Q: My family just returned from a vacation and we took over 1,800 photos between us. I want to pare this down to something reasonable for a slideshow,</b><b>and figured the way to do that is to compile all the photos into one place and share that with the other photographers, and have them all “like” the ones to use in the slideshow.</b></p>
<p class="ezoeAlignright text-right"><i>— Corey Henson</i></p>
<p><b>A:</b> So far so good. However, Corey found that while people with access to the library can tap Like in iOS, there’s no way to sort the images or create a smart album in Photos for macOS. The likes don’t even show up! Corey wondered if they were missing something?</p>
<p>You’re missing nothing: Photos for iOS and macOS have slightly different features, and shared albums lack options that would let you reduce or sort the set.</p>

<p><b>You can Like an image in a iCloud shared album and iCloud counts the number of likes, but this isn’t available on a Mac and doesn’t show there.</b></p>
</figcaption>
    
    
    
    </div><p>In Photos for iOS and macOS, you can view an image or video in the regular (not shared) collection, and tap a heart button (or press the period button in macOS) and the image is marked as Added To Favorites. When you create a smart album in macOS, you can use that, as Corey notes, as one of the parameters. I use this all the time to create sets as Corey does of the best images from a larger set.</p>
<p>However, macOS doesn’t offer a heart button for media in shared albums. In iOS, there’s a Like link (as the literal text <i>Like</i>), which isn’t synced to macOS, and is neither viewable nor settable when visiting the album via a website. What good does Like do? It feels like a half implemented feature.</p>
<p>Because Photos for iOS lacks some macOS features, you can’t make smart albums at all (though you can view them), and you can’t use Like as a criteria to sort, either. You also can’t see a total number of Likes or other details in Photos for iOS. What good is it? No idea.</p>
<p>My low-tech suggestion is to do a rapid-fire slideshow with family in Photos for macOS, and mark those that are collective favorites, and then use a smart album to collect them, select them, and create a shared album from that.</p>
<p>Ostensibly, Apple could fix feature and status synchronization in a future update to Photos on both platforms and to the <a href="http://iCloud.com" target="_self">iCloud.com</a> version.</p>

<p><b>Apple lets you opt to avoid iOS and macOS authentication for a login by using a text message or an automated voice call.</b></p>

    </div><h3><b>Can Windows be used with Apple’s two-factor authentication?</b></h3><p>Reader Sandie has an iPad and a Windows 10 system, and wondered how to use Apple’s two-factor authentication (2FA) with that setup. Apple doesn’t offer 2FA tools under Windows, but you don’t need a Mac or a second iOS device to get the advantages.</p>
<p>Setting up 2FA on a single device is relatively easy, because the assumption is that you don’t have a second device ready yet, and you can validate yourself through a code sent via text message or read aloud to you by a computer-generated voice on a call placed to a phone number you provide.</p>
<p>After that, any attempt to log in to an account on an iOS or macOS device that isn’t yet trusted (or hasn’t been recently validated) results in a location dialog on all of your iOS and macOS devices that are linked to the same Apple ID asking you to allow or reject the authentication request.</p>
<p>Apple lets you opt to avoid iOS and macOS authentication for a login by using a text message or an automated voice call.</p>
<p>But you can also bypass that. With a Web login, for instance, you can click or tap the Didn’t Get A Verification Link. That allows you to select Text Me or Use Phone Number (depending on whether you’ve verified SMS or a voice number or both) and have the code delivered that way.</p>
<p>Now if you want additional insurance that you won’t lock yourself out if you lose your iOS device and access to your phone number at the same time (say by losing your phone or having it stolen), use the 2FA setup section at the <a href="http://go.macworld.com/aid" target="_self">Apple ID website</a> to add other trusted phone numbers, such as a spouse, partner, family member, or close friend. Follow these steps:</p>
<p><b>1</b>. After logging in to <a href="http://appleid.apple.com" target="_self">appleid.apple.com</a>, click the Edit button at the far right of the Security section.</p>
<p><b>2</b>. Click Add A Trusted Number<i>.</i></p>
<p><b>3</b>. Enter the number and select whether it can receive an SMS or voice call.</p>
<p><b>4</b>. Click Continue. Apple texts or calls you with the code.</p>
<p><b>5</b>. Enter that code and click Verify.</p>
<p>Add an additional trusted phone number (or multiple) to avoid a single device providing all your account verification with 2FA.</p>
<p>That number is now another method you can use in case your others aren’t available. (It’s also a weak point: if someone gets your password and can access one of these phone numbers that is less under your control, they can break into your account.)</p>

    </div><h3><b>How to adjust mailbox behavior for sent mail via iCloud from a Mac</b></h3><p>David Whitton finds that when he sends email using iCloud from Apple’s Mail app in macOS that the outgoing messages can wind up arbitrarily in the Sent mailbox in either the iCloud account or the On My Mac section.</p>
<p>This is a concern for him, because the On My Mac archived messages don’t appear to him on other devices, like his iPhone.</p>

<p><b>You can pick whether special mailboxes store messages locally or on the mail server.</b></p>
</figcaption>
    
    
    
    </div><p>Mail organizes mailboxes by local and remote storage, generally preferring server-hosted messages using IMAP. If you have multiple accounts, the Mailboxes section will show generally used mailbox names with an expansion triangle to the left of each name. This lets you manage these common folders in one place. All your custom folders typically appear beneath a label in the mailboxes sidebar that has the name you use in Mail → Preferences → Account Name → Account Information in the Description field.</p>
<p>The exception is On My Mac, which indicates all the local folders on the computer you’re currently using. You can drag messages among those mailboxes locally, but you can also drag and archive messages from any hosted mailbox into the On My Mac area, or vice versa, which uploads messages back into mail-server folders.</p>
<p>But Apple also lets you set behavior in the account section under Mailbox Behaviors, choosing for several kinds of mailboxes— Drafts, Sent, Junk, and Trash—whether you want to use a hosted mailbox or one stored locally, organized under On My Mac.</p>
<p>David had three questions related to this, which can all now be solved:</p>
<p><b>How to move the current sent messages from On My Mac to iCloud?</b></p>
<p><b>1</b>. Make sure the Sent mailbox showing under Mailboxes reveals the iCloud mailbox.</p>
<p><b>2</b>. In the On My Mac section, select all the messages in the Sent Messages folder.</p>
<p><b>3</b>. Drag those messages onto the Sent mailbox for iCloud.</p>
<p>This may take a while, depending on the number of messages and your Internet connection’s throughput.</p>
<p><b>How to file the messages correctly in the future?</b> In the Mailbox Behaviors section, from the Sent Mailbox pop-up menu, select Sent Messages under the iCloud label.</p>
<p><b>How to stop Mail from re-creating the On My Mac Sent Messages mailbox?</b></p>
<p>Taking the previous step should prevent it. But make sure that if you have multiple accounts, that you’ve changed the behavior for the sent mail for each account.</p>

    </div><h3><b>How to sync past events in your Calendar on your iPhone and Mac</b></h3><p><b>Q: I was in a country where there were no Internet connections. When I came home, I made the correction on my iMac because I wanted to have a correct record of the itinerary changes. I notice all my devices would not update because it was a past event.</b></p>
<p class="ezoeAlignright text-right"><i>— Elliot</i></p>
<p><b>A:</b> There’s no setting on a Mac that helps with this, and no way to determine how old events are updated. However, in iOS, you can choose how far back events synchronize. In Settings → Calendar → Sync, you can pick either all events or a duration back two weeks, one month, three months, or six months.</p>
<p>Apple offers no support notes on this, nor, in my testing, can I figure out if it relates to just syncing these events once or when past events change.</p>
<p>What I suspect happened to Elliot is that his iPhone is set to Events 2 Weeks Back, which appears to be the default, and thus when he made the change to his Mac after two weeks away, those older events never synced back. Changing the setting in iOS should propagate those changes.</p>
