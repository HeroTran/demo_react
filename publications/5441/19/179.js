Bipolar disorder is also known as manic depression because a person’s mood can alternate between the “poles”—mania (highs) and depression (lows). The change in mood can last for hours, days, weeks, or months.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><b>What bipolar is not</b></h3><p>Bipolar disorder is not a character flaw or sign of personal weakness.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><b>Whom bipolar disorder affects</b></h3><p> Bipolar disorder affects more than 5.7 million adult Americans and 440,000 adult Canadians. It usually begins in late adolescence, often appearing as depression during teen years, although it can start in early childhood or later in life.</p>\n<p>An equal number of men and women develop this illness. Men tend to begin with a manic episode, women with a depressive episode. Bipolar disorder is found among all ages, races, ethnic groups, and social classes.The illness tends to run in families and appears to have a genetic link.</p>\n<p>Like depression and other serious illnesses, bipolar disorder can also negatively affect spouses, partners, family members, friends, and co-workers.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><b>Types of bipolar disorder</b></h3><p>Different types of bipolar disorder are determined by patterns and severity of symptoms of highs and lows.</p>\n<p><b>BIPOLAR I DISORDER</b> is characterized by one or more manic episodes that last at least a week or require hospitalization.</p>\n<p>Episodes of depression and hypomania may also occur. Some mood episodes may have mixed features (symptoms of both depression and mania/hypomania).</p>\n<p>Behavior during mania and disability during bipolar depression can lead to severe financial, family and social disruption.</p>\n<p><b> BIPOLAR II DISORDER</b> is characterized by one or more depressive episodes accompanied by at least one hypomanic episode. Hypomanic episodes have symptoms similar to manic episodes but are less extreme and don’t last as long. However, the person’s behavior is clearly different from the norm to observers.</p>\n<p><b>CYCLOTHYMIC DISORDER</b> is characterized by chronic mood fluctuations that do not reach the level of a full manic or depressive episode. However, symptoms cause significant distress in personal relationships, work or school, and other areas of life when they occur. Although symptoms are relatively mild compared to Bipolar I or Bipolar II, they recur within two months each time. People with cyclothymia may go on to develop a more extreme form of bipolar illness.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><b>Symptoms of bipolar disorder</b></h3><p>Most people who have bipolar disorder talk about experiencing “highs” and “lows.” These swings can be severe, ranging from extreme energy to deep despair. The severity of the mood swings and the way they disrupt normal life activities distinguish bipolar mood episodes from ordinary mood changes.</p>\n<h4><b>SYMPTOMS OF MANIA:</b></h4><p>• Increased physical and mental activity and energy</p>\n<p>• Heightened mood, exaggerated optimism and self-confidence</p>\n<p>• Excessive irritability, aggressive behavior</p>\n<p>• Decreased need for sleep without experiencing fatigue</p>\n<p>• Racing speech, thoughts, and flight of ideas</p>\n<p>• Increased sexual drive</p>\n<p>• Reckless behavior</p>\n<h4><b>SYMPTOMS OF DEPRESSION:</b></h4><p>• Prolonged sadness or unexplained crying spells, profound hopelessness</p>\n<p> • Significant changes in appetite and sleep patterns</p>\n<p>• Irritability, anger, worry, agitation, anxiety</p>\n<p>• Pessimism, loss of energy, persistent lethargy</p>\n<p>• Feelings of guilt and worthlessness</p>\n<p>• Inability to concentrate, indecisiveness</p>\n<p>• Recurring thoughts of death and suicide</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><b>How common is bipolar disorder in children?</b></h3><p>Because bipolar disorder tends to run in families, having a parent with bipolar increases the likelihood that a child also will develop bipolar. When one parent has bipolar disorder, the risk to each child is estimated to be 15–30 percent. When both parents have the disorder, the risk increases to 50–75 percent.</p>\n<p>Symptoms of mood disorders may be difficult to recognize in children and adolescents because they can be mistaken for age-appropriate emotions and behaviors, or overlap with symptoms of other conditions such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). However, depression and anxiety in children may be precursors to bipolar and should be carefully evaluated and monitored.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><b>Treatment for bipolar disorder</b></h3><p>Several therapies exist for bipolar disorder and promising new treatments are currently under investigation. Because bipolar disorder can be difficult to treat, it is highly recommended that you consult a psychiatrist or a general practitioner with experience in treating this illness. Treatments may include medication, talk therapy, and support groups.</p>\n<p> Read more at <b><a href=\"http://bphope.com\" target=\"_self\">bphope.com</a></b></p>\n","layout":{},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":0,"link_source":"","competition":[],"flatplan_title":"","notes":"","gutter_credit":"","other":"","image":[{"id":"534cc9b463d95ff1802baa664f6047bd","name":"bp-magazine-icon","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_5441/storage/images/media2/images/bp-magazine-icon3/34930-1-eng-GB/bp-magazine-icon.jpg?t=default_ipad_portrait&ext/bp-magazine-icon_default_ipad_portrait.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"768","height":"768","legacy_id":"3262","is_default":true},{"id":"534cc9b463d95ff1802baa664f6047bd","name":"bp-magazine-icon","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_5441/storage/images/media2/images/bp-magazine-icon3/34930-1-eng-GB/bp-magazine-icon.jpg?t=default_ipad_landscape&ext/bp-magazine-icon_default_ipad_landscape.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"768","height":"768","legacy_id":"3262","is_default":false}],"url_alias":"http://bpmagazine.audiencemedia.com","type":"story","order":"0","folio_number":"C2","folio_numbers":"C2","pdf_page_index":"0","thumbnail":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_5441/storage/images/media2/images/bp-magazine-icon3/34930-1-eng-GB/bp-magazine-icon.jpg?t=tablet_story_thumbnail&ext/bp-magazine-icon_tablet_story_thumbnail.jpg","color":"FFFFFF","real_id":"3225","main_section_id":"179","ads":[]},{"id":"zinio_19_bpmagus170401_article_003_01_1490200456.6087","title":"Risky Business","sub_title":"","author":[{"id":"0","name":"Joanne M.

Over the last few years I’ve written and rewritten it on our white board. It stares me in the face every hour of every day and pushes me to get the job done. Get the message out. No excuses.</p>\n<p>So far, so good, but here’s the thing: combine that with an entrepreneur’s “trust your gut” instincts and you’ve got risky business. Same thing when mania or hypomania roll in and the usual filters come off.</p>\n<p>Yes, we can achieve a lot, enjoy a lot, when we’re not held back by indecision, but watch out—the reverse is true, too. The results of impulsive decision-making can be devastating. “Impulse Power” shows how to build in fail-safes to help us pause and ponder whether it’s a good idea to “just go for it.”</p>\n<p>Part of our mission at <i>bp Magazine</i> has always been to connect you with “been there, done that” guidance from others who really know what you’re going through. For “Profiles in Parenting,” writer Stephanie Stephens interviewed three families who share their wisdom of experience—along with real-life proof that it’s possible to advocate for and navigate a child with bipolar through their adolescent years.</p>\n<p>There’s no doubt that getting enough physical activity is key to wellness, but there’s also no denying there are plenty of roadblocks to maintaining an exercise routine. Not enough time, not enough energy, no interest … those are just some of the all-too-human exercise excuses we address in “Action Plan.” One tip: Thinking about the immediate mood boost that comes from going for a walk or working out reinforces intrinsic motivation, which is our inner inclination to do something.</p>\n<p>And keep this advice from personal trainer Kathleen Trotter in mind: “Perfect is the enemy of done, so stop trying to find the ‘perfect’ way to work out … do what you can.” That’s good to remember whether we’re trying to move more or chasing stability.</p>\n<p class=\"byline\">By Joanne M.

The journey to success is always the best part and helps me connect to them. “The Maestro &amp; Me2/” (Winter 2017) is by far my favorite, though. Not only is Ronald Braunstein extremely successful in his craft, but he has altered and molded his career into something that includes others living in similar situations. To me this seems like the best kind of advocacy. I’ll be watching the orchestra’s website to see if they ever come out my way!<br /><b>—L.E.</b> ST. LOUIS, MO</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\nAWESOME! I’VE ALWAYS WANTED somewhere I could work and just be with people like me.<br /><b>—F.J.G.</b> via facebook</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\nI AM SO GLAD Maestro Braunstein can still work and help people with mental disorders feel good about themselves. He is a true advocate for bipolar and I am so proud of him and all he has accomplished despite his diagnosis. He is not afraid to speak out about his illness and helps so many people. He is a true inspiration and his wife is his caring support system.<br /><b>—Marca</b> via bphope.com</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\nTHIS IS FANTASTIC. I am also a musician with bipolar disorder: opera singer and choir director.<br /><b>—E.H.</b> via facebook</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_5441/storage/images/media2/images/bpwin17-mania-spread/34944-1-eng-GB/bpwin17-mania-spread.jpg\" width=\"1024\" height=\"612\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"bpWin17-Mania-Spread\" title=\"bpWin17-Mania-Spread\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3>INSIGHT INTO MANIA</h3><p>\nI THINK THE ARTICLE ON MANIA (“Getting a Grip on Mania,” Winter 2017) is a very good overview of the manic side of bipolar disorder. In reading and researching so much in order to help our daughter, I have come to the conclusion that my daughter’s husband was her trigger for mania. She was the breadwinner and homeowner before their marriage and spent extravagantly on him. He was the beneficiary of her manic episodes and took advantage of her. I wonder how many people with bipolar find themselves in this position. We will get her through this with the help of a great team.<br /><b>—Name Withheld</b></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\nI AM SO GLAD that I subscribe to your magazine. There is so much useful information for me. I have been diagnosed with bipolar I. Right now I am going through a bad state of mania. I can’t sleep, I’m spending like crazy, and have energy to burn, I can’t sit still for 5 minutes. Hopefully this article will help me cope.<br /><b>—Irene Weiler,</b> KITCHENER, ON</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>CREATIVE DEBATE</h3><p>\nTHANK YOU SO MUCH for the On My Mind article about medications not taking away one’s creativity (“Medication and Inspiration,” Winter 2017). That is an argument I hear all the time, most specifically from my daughter’s boyfriend who thinks that he needs to suffer (be unhappy) to be an artist.<br /><b>—C.G.,</b> ASHBURN, VA</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\nI AM A PROFESSIONAL COMPOSER and published poet—with a seriously bipolar mind. I was immensely scared to lose my creativity when I got diagnosed, which is now eight years ago. The contrary happened: my works are more mature, and still exuberant, complex and layered.<br /><b>—Mitch</b> via bphope.com</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\nI DO AGREE [about controlling mania with medication in order to produce lasting artistic works], unless the medication makes you overly sedated. Currently I’m on a cocktail that doesn’t sedate me that much and allows me to think clearly. Yes, thinking clearly is not possible when I am manic or often even moderately hypomanic. Yes, when I’m manic I think what I produce is superior, but you make a great point that when the mania clears, you realize it’s not so much. A lot of what I say or write when in elevated states is disjointed or even nonsensical. Being stable allows a much higher percentage of my life to be creative.<br /><b>—Forsythia</b> via bphope.com</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\nFOR ME SO FAR all the meds I’ve been on have masked my creativity.<br /><b>—Bobbi Lee</b> via bphope.com</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>‘GETTING IT’</h3><p>\nI HAVEN’T READ AN ARTICLE on bipolar as eloquent and truthful as your piece (“What I Wish Family and Friends Knew,” Winter 2017). I am 50 and was diagnosed at age 17. My family refused to believe I had a mental illness. My own mother thought I was “lazy and stupid,” which I am not. After my fifth hospitalization they decided that the medical doctors were probably right.<br /><b>—Nicole</b> via bphope.com</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\nTHANK YOU FOR this article. It helps to know I’m not alone.<br /><b>—Hans</b> via bphope.com</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\nAfter reading <b>“WHAT I WISH MY FAMILY AND FRIENDS KNEW,”</b> I cried my eyes out. It’s so refreshing to see someone put into words how I feel daily. It seems as if most people don’t view bipolar as a real illness although we battle with it daily. We didn’t ask for this. It’s just the cards we were dealt. I struggle with relationships and wonder if I will ever find someone who can accept me and this illness and love, learn, and deal with all that comes along with it.<br /><b><i>—</i>Coco </b>via bphope.com</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\nTHANKS FOR getting it right.<br /><b>—Gayle</b> via bphope.com</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>NEW PERSPECTIVES</h3><p>\nJUST HAD AN “AHA!” MOMENT reading Julie Fast’s column “Unexpected Signs of Depression” (Winter 2017). I experience varying degrees of all three of these signs [irritability, restlessness, inability to feel loving]. “Can’t feel love” struck a cord and it makes sense to me now where this comes from. My husband, thankfully, is great at working through this with me and I’ve learned to seek help when I’m in a deep state of any one of these. Thank you for helping me to understand my illness better!<br /><b>—faithfilled2017</b> via bphope.com</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\nI AM NEW TO the bpHope website and this article was the first thing that stuck out. I thought I was going crazy until I read it. I never thought of being irritable as a sign of my bipolar rearing its ugly head. Sometimes I can’t feel the love for myself after the irritability occurs. Thank you so much for the article!<br /><b>—Tonia</b> via bphope.com</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\nTHE IRRITATION YOU TALK ABOUT sounds just like me. I go off in a fraction of a second over absolutely nothing, and 15 minutes later I am fine. I need to talk to my psychiatrist about this. Thank you for the heads up.<br /><b>—Kelly</b> via bphope.com</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>BOOK: 'NO MORE SECRETS'</h3><p>\nI JUST FINISHED READING Mimi Baird’s book <i>He Wanted the Moon: The Madness and Medical Genius of Dr. Perry Baird, and His Daughter’s Quest to Know Him</i> (“Back Chat: Mimi Baird,” Winter 2017). This book made me feel so much, I cried at parts. I will never forget how this book validates bipolar disorder. I, too, want the moon and that gave me peace.<br /><b>—Kdean</b> via bphope.com</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\nI READ THIS BOOK [by Mimi Baird] about a year ago. Though psychiatric care probably isn’t where it should be, nor is inpatient hospital care, I am forever grateful that I did not struggle with mental illness during the 1940s, ’50s, etc. The book was a real eye-opener!<br /><b>—Stacy</b> via bphope.com</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\nTHIS ISSUE OF passing down the story of the treatment of mental illness is of paramount importance because of the repercussions it has on the generations that follow. My dear mam was and still is very open about her father’s treatment when he was mentally ill in the 1950s and all five of us children have witnessed her psychotic periods, severe anxiety, paranoia, and deep depression—painful at a young age, and it affects each child in a different way. However, it has made us very knowledgeable as concerns the warning signs and treatment of mental illness. I do not shy away from behavior which others may find very upsetting because I understand so much more about it.<br /><b>—Jen</b> via bphope.com</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\nI MUST GET THIS BOOK! But I’m skeptical about the Hollywood adaptation [of <i>He Wanted the Moon</i>], as that industry hasn’t exactly shown any regard for truth or scientifically accurate representation of mental illness, especially bipolar disorder. But I’ll keep fingers crossed.<br /><b>—D.A.B.</b> via facebook</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>STRENGTH &amp; HOPE</h3><p>\nYOUR MAGAZINE HAS BEEN so informational to me and my husband. My daughter has bipolar II and it helped us understand the diagnosis better which, in turn, helps us understand our daughter’s mood episodes. She is on meds, in therapy, and raising a family. We are (at least try to be) supportive any way we can.<br /><b>—Name Withheld,</b> STILWELL, KS</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\nI THINK YOU HAVE an excellent [online] support forum. It allows people to be upfront and it eases the pain and shame until one is ready to open up in front of a person. I don’t have to explain my feelings over and over because people understand from their experiences. I get help just from reading others’ posts.<br /><b>—Name Withheld</b> CHICAGO, IL</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\nI CANNOT EXPLAIN how the quality of my life has improved since finding <i>bp Magazine</i>. As with many of us with bipolar, I have been stigmatized by a number of family members who will not discuss my bipolar. I have found wonderful professional treatment and educators, but nothing can compare with reading a story from a fellow individual with bipolar who is willing to share their experience, strength and hope. I can read these articles without fear of rejection, giving me the freedom to say, “Yeah, me too.”<br /><b>—Linda</b> via bphope.com</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\nI WAS REALLY AMAZED to see that there is a separate magazine published for people with bipolar disorder. It gave me immense pleasure and satisfaction to know about the latest news and views regarding bipolar. I had undiagnosed bipolar for years, with feelings of suicide, hopelessness, etc., blaming myself and not knowing where to find the solution. Finally I got a correct diagnosis in 2011. I have been on several prescriptions and by now, I know which medication suits me or not. I even had a successful pregnancy and delivered a healthy boy. I just wanted to say to all my friends out there who have bipolar, that there is hope always and never give up on yourself.<br /><b>—Name Withheld,</b> HYDERABAD,

The annual competition has partnered this year with the Campaign to Change Direction, an effort to transform how we as a nation think and talk about mental health.</p>\n<p>Other outreach projects have included a screening of the movie <i>Inside Out</i> at Quinnipiac University in Connecticut and an event featuring hot air balloon rides at the University of Florida.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Baton Rouge may revisit crisis center tax</h3><p>March 3, 2017, BATON ROUGE, LA—Efforts to revisit a dedicated tax to fund a new mental health facility and crisis response team met “no objections” from elected leader Sharon Weston Broome, the <i>Baton Rouge Advocate</i> reports.</p>\n<p>Voters narrowly rejected the property tax at the polls in December 2016, when Broome became the city’s mayor-president. If a majority of Metro Council members agree to return the tax proposal to the ballot, it would go before voters again in October.</p>\n<p>The proposed Bridge Center would prevent non-violent individuals in the midst of a psychiatric crisis from being jailed.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Columbus advocates enlist faith leaders</h3><p>March 3, 2017, COLUMBUS, OH —Mental health advocates are enlisting the help of clergy, the <i>Columbus Dispatch</i> reports.</p>\n<p>The National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) branch in Franklin County and the county Alcohol, Drug and Mental Health Board are running awareness workshops for faith leaders of churches, synagogues and mosques so that they can then help educate their congregations.</p>\n<p>For example, Senior Minister Tim Ahrens of First Congregational Church gave a series of sermons about mental health. “To have a well-known pastor come out and say, ‘This is something we need to look at,’ it really begins to take away the stigma in church,” said Rachelle Martin, executive director of NAMI Franklin County.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Nevada governor proposes steep cuts</h3><p>March 3, 2017, RENO, NV—Gov. Brian Sandoval’s proposal to cut $20 million in state-provided mental health services has met with opposition from some lawmakers as well as mental health advocates, social workers, judges, and police officers who said there is already a severe lack of services.</p>\n<p>Sandoval has argued that his decision to expand Medicaid coverage means more individuals who need help will get it through that insurance program, which is largely funded by the federal government. State Assemblyman Mike Sprinkle pointed to a lack of data on whether patients dropped by state agencies are receiving care elsewhere.</p>\n<p>Cuts in Reno have affected outpatient medication clinics, outpatient counseling services, and the rapid stabilization unit at the state’s psychiatric hospital.</p>\n<p>According to the <i>Reno Gazette-Journal</i>, emergency rooms have seen a spike in individuals in need of psychiatric care and a significant increase in the number of petitions for civil commitment to a psychiatric hospital. A mobile outreach team found in two-thirds of encounters, the individual was receiving no mental health care.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>North Carolina schools object to cost of recommended mental health reforms</h3><p>MARCH 1, 2017, RALEIGH, NC—State education leaders are working to revise a proposed mental health policy for public schools that generated opposition from stakeholders, WRAL-TV reports.</p>\n<p>According to the NBC affiliate, the original draft policy called for mental health training for staff, policies for mental health services, and in-school mental health assistance teams consisting of a social worker, psychologist, counselor, nurse and community mental health provider.</p>\n<p>Local school boards and charter schools said some of the guidelines were burdensome and expensive to implement.</p>\n<p>Amanda Bell, a school board member in Rockingham County who is an advisor to the state board of education, said the proposed policy is an “admirable effort” but that many schools have had to eliminate school nurses and share social workers due to bare-bones budgets.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Few employees take advantage of assistance plans</h3><p>February 16, 2017, BROOKFIELD, WI—In a new survey of American employers, a quarter were unwilling or unable to estimate rates of mental and substance use disorders among their employees. Another two-thirds put the figure at less than 30 percent of their workforce.</p>\n<p>The survey of 247 employers by the International Foundation of Employee Benefit Plans also found that 90 percent had an employee assistance program in place, and that most of those programs included mental health assistance or counseling.</p>\n<p>However, usage of employee assistance programs ranged from only 1 percent to 6 percent of the workforce, indicating that most employees are unaware of the services or reluctant to use them.</p>\n<p>Around a quarter of the employers surveyed offered stress management training, and nearly 40 percent had wellness programs that included a mental health or substance abuse component.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_5441/storage/images/media2/images/demi_landscape/34972-1-eng-GB/demi_landscape.jpg\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"Demi_Landscape\" title=\"Demi_Landscape\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n <span class=\"credit\">\nCourtesy of the \"Be Vocal: Speak Up for Mental Health\" initiative</span></figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3>Demi Lovato and ‘Be Vocal’ release powerful new documentary about ending the silence</h3><p>February 22, 2017, LOS ANGELES, CA—Entertainer and mental health advocate Demi Lovato and a team from the Be Vocal anti-stigma initiative premiered the new documentary <i>Beyond Silence</i>.</p>\n<p>Lovato is an executive producer of the documentary, which follows three individuals who live with different brain-based disorders but share a common experience: their lives have been transformed by speaking out about mental health.</p>\n<p>“I hope that this film will show people that there is nothing wrong with having a mental health condition,” Lovato told <i>Variety</i>. “It’s important that we get that message out there because mental health is so important—it’s just as important as physical health.”</p>\n<p>Lovato, who has bipolar disorder, speaks often about her own recovery journey.

They followed teens and adults with bipolar over a 12-month period and compared them with a matched group from the general population.</p>\n<p>Having lower baseline scores in cognitive domains such as attention, verbal memory, and working memory predicted increasing body mass index for both groups. Neither baseline BMI nor increasing BMI predicted lower cognitive function.</p>\n<p>The researchers said targeting patients’ cognition may be important for minimizing weight gain in bipolar disorder.</p>\n<p>The study, which appeared in the journal <i>Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica</i>, was entitled “Lower cognitive functioning as a predictor of weight gain in bipolar disorder: A 12-month study.”</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>ACT therapy good for bipolar with anxiety</h3><p> March 1, 2017, STOCKHOLM, Sweden —Acceptance and commitment therapy appears beneficial for people with bipolar disorder who have co-existing anxiety, a small pilot study suggests.</p>\n<p>Acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) involves psychological interventions that encourage mindfulness, learning to accept painful thoughts and feelings as they are, and working around them to pursue new behaviors.</p>\n<p>Swedish researchers, noting co-existing bipolar and anxiety often means a poorer treatment outcome, had people with bipolar types I or II take part in 12 sessions of group ACT. After treatment, participants reported significant improvements in anxiety or depressive symptoms, quality of life, psychological flexibility, and other areas.</p>\n<p>The study, which appeared in the journal <i>Cognitive Behaviour Therapy</i>, was entitled “Group acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) for bipolar disorder and co-existing anxiety—an open pilot study.”</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Collaborative care helps diabetes outcomes</h3><p>February 1, 2017, SEATTLE, WA—Integrating behavioral health care and medical care appears to improve type 2 diabetes in people with bipolar disorder and other psychiatric conditions, a new study suggests.</p>\n<p>American researchers looked at 600 individuals being treated at a “safety net” primary care clinic, meaning it serves many low-income individuals. Around 151 patients with higher levels of hemoglobin A1c—an indicator of high blood glucose levels—were referred to a collaborative care team.</p>\n<p> Rates of mood and anxiety disorders were higher in this group than among patients who were not referred.</p>\n<p>During the 18-month study, the group treated by the collaborative care team had significantly greater reductions in hemoglobin A1c than those who received treatment as usual.</p>\n<p>The study, which appeared in the journal <i>General Hospital Psychiatry</i>, was entitled “A collaborative care team to integrate behavioral health care and treatment of poorly-controlled type 2 diabetes in an urban safety net primary care clinic.”</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Predictors of substance use in youth with high levels of manic behavior</h3><p>February 1, 2017, NEW YORK, NY—A new study highlights possible risk factors for regular use of alcohol or drugs in young people prone to mania.</p>\n<p>American researchers screened children between ages 6 and 13 at child outpatient mental health clinics to identify those who scored high on an assessment tool that measures manic behaviors. Youth in the study were assessed every six months over six years.</p>\n<p>The researchers found that a baseline diagnosis of disruptive behavior disorder, stressful life events, a high manic symptom burden in the first two years of follow-up, and family environment were predictors for regular use of substances. Being treated with medication decreased the risk of regular drug use.</p>\n<p>The study, which appeared in the <i>Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry</i>, was entitled “Development of alcohol and drug use in youth with manic symptoms.”</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Polarity of first episode affects other factors</h3><p>February 1, 2017, MILAN, Italy—People with bipolar disorder whose first episode was a depressive state are at higher risk of suicide, a new study suggests.</p>\n<p>Italian and American researchers, noting that polarity at onset of bipolar has been increasingly studied in recent years, looked at 362 bipolar patients in recovery. Their analysis found that those with depressive onset had a rate of suicide attempts more than double that of people whose initial onset was manic, hypomanic, or mixed.</p>\n<p>Depressive onset was also associated with significantly higher rates of bipolar II diagnosis, lifetime stressful events, current psychiatric medicine use, and longer duration of most recent mood episode.</p>\n<p>However, this group had lower rates of psychosis and involuntary commitments. They were also more likely to be married and employed than the group with elevated onset.</p>\n<p>The study, which appeared in the <i>Journal of Affective Disorders</i>, was entitled “Onset polarity in bipolar disorder: A strong association between first depressive episode and suicide attempts.”</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Bipolar treatment should address cardio fitness</h3><p>February 1, 2017, LEUVEN, Belgium—People with bipolar disorder and other serious brain-based disorders have significantly lower cardiorespiratory fitness than people with no psychiatric diagnosis, but targeted supervision and exercise can improve those fitness levels, a new study suggests.</p>\n<p>Belgian, Brazilian, Australian and British researchers conducted an analysis of previous studies involving fitness levels of people with serious psychiatric disorders. Although fitness levels in this population were significantly lower overall in comparison to control groups, the researchers also found that high-intensity interventions (exercise at least three times per week and supervision by specialists such as physiotherapists and exercise psychologists) were associated with improved cardiorespiratory fitness.</p>\n<p>Noting that poor cardiorespiratory fitness is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease and premature mortality, the study authors concluded that treatment plans should include a focus on improving fitness.</p>\n<p>The study, which appeared in the journal <i>Sports Medicine</i>, was entitled “Cardiorespiratory fitness in severe mental illness: A systematic review and meta-analysis.”</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Impact of psychosocial history on suicide risk</h3><p>January 25, 2017, TOLEDO, OH—A new study sheds light on risk factors associated with suicide among young adults with bipolar disorder.</p>\n<p>American researchers studied the records of individuals with bipolar who were treated at a university outpatient psychiatric clinic and found that 41 percent had attempted suicide.</p>\n<p>The researchers said that asking about previous suicide attempts is the most accurate way to predict future suicidal behavior, but that a younger age at onset of illness, past trauma, a history of alcohol abuse, and psychotic symptoms were also strongly associated with suicidality.</p>\n<p>They recommended an increased emphasis on psychosocial history and comorbid symptoms in treating patients with bipolar disorder.</p>\n<p>The study, which appeared in the journal <i>Psychopathology</i> online ahead of print, was entitled “Psychosocial factors and comorbidity associated with suicide attempts: Findings in patients with bipolar disorder.”</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_5441/storage/images/media2/images/toxoplasma_gondii/34986-1-eng-GB/toxoplasma_gondii.jpg\" width=\"1024\" height=\"635\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"Toxoplasma_gondii\" title=\"Toxoplasma_gondii\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3>Common parasite may be a trigger for bipolar disorder</h3><p>February 1, 2017, BELO HORIZONTE, Brazil—Existing evidence supports the idea that early infection with the single-celled parasite Toxoplasma gondii increases the risk of developing bipolar disorder, according to a new study.</p>\n<p>Brazilian and American researchers conducted an analysis of previous studies looking at possible links between bipolar and T. gondii, which is found in cat feces.

They looked at two cognitive categories before and after treatment for insomnia: verbal learning and working memory, which involves reasoning, decision-making, and processing information.</p>\n<p>The researchers found that improved consistency in sleep time predicted improved verbal learning and more total sleep time predicted improved working memory.
