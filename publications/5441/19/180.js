People with mental health issues can choose from every imaginable form of therapy, from interpersonal to cognitive to eclectic. More research has created an ever-expanding knowledge base.</p>\n<p>Yet if you live with bipolar disorder, quality care can be difficult to access. Significant disparity in insurance coverage continues. Stable employment is elusive, despite the Americans with Disabilities Act. And if you do get hired, who knows if you’ll receive acceptance—much less accommodation—in the workplace.</p>\n<p>It’s a real paradox. Despite all the advances, a person with a mood disorder still encounters a challenging environment where he is often seen as a second-class citizen. Capable, customized, compassionate treatment is not the norm. Far too much chaos and confusion continues.</p>\n<p>Ken Kesey’s novel <i>One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest</i>, published more than 50 years ago, depicted a mental health system that was inhumane and unjust. Patients today may not be dehumanized with labels like “Acutes and Chronics,” as in Kesey’s book, but similar contemporary terms like “chronically disabled” do nothing for a person’s sense of well-being.</p>\n<p>If you remember the Jack Nicholson movie, you’ll recall that the same cassette music played over and over, evidence of the sickening, habitual, so-called “therapeutic approach” that could drive anyone mad. Today, we still have too many generalized, cookie-cutter approaches to achieving wellness and too few of the focused, client-centered type. We should all be tired of the same old song.</p>\n<p>Decades after Kesey’s work, many people still spend years in treatment or therapy without a specific plan developed or a desired outcome discussed. Medications are often prescribed without proper education; moreover, inferior, cost-cutting drugs are often tried before a more desired option is prescribed. Pardon me, but that’s cuckoo!</p>\n<p>Treatment issues aside, we still have a tremendous problem when it comes to making a proper diagnosis. On average, it takes 8–10 years from onset of symptoms for a person to receive an accurate diagnosis of bipolar disorder. Then, good luck finding a capable, caring psychiatrist who is taking new patients—not to mention who accepts your insurance.</p>\n<p>Another problem is more basic in nature. Human beings, like snowflakes, are unique; however, people living with bipolar are often branded as uniquely <i>different</i>, leaving them feeling isolated and alone. They face tremendous stereotyping by the media, stigmatization by the public, and significant internal shame. The resulting self-imprisonment is sometimes worse than institutional incarceration. Many would rather seek refuge in a hospital than face an apathetic, even hostile, outside world.</p>\n<p>Indeed, the bipolar condition itself is a paradox; it is biological in origin yet psychological in expression. While people living with a mood disorder can be creative, outgoing, and personable, many times the public perception focuses on outward manifestations, such as unpredictable behavior, erratic thoughts, and impulsive decisions.</p>\n<p>And the people who one would think are in the best position to help are sometimes not able to because they are just too close to the situation. Even family members who have been educated on brain-based disorders may continue to struggle with long-standing memories of problems from the past.</p>\n<p>Today’s mental health system still needs fixing. People living with bipolar still confront a society that can be cold and uncaring. In many ways, there is still too much <i>Cuckoo’s Nest</i> at play.</p>\n<p>It’s high time to start recognizing bipolar as a treatable medical condition; to start providing more accessible, quality care; to stop reducing people to their diagnosis; and to stop stripping people of their humanity. Let’s advocate strongly for positive change. Let’s move beyond the problematic paradox we face today. Let’s promote the realistic possibility for a better tomorrow where wellness and well-being come first—for all of us.</p>\n<p>\n<i>-----</i><br /><i>Stephen Propst is an advocate, writer, public speaker, and coach/consultant focusing on living successfully with conditions like bipolar.

McInnis, MD, FRCPsych</p>\n<h3><b>Establishing boundaries is a challenge for me. Maybe if I understood this better, I would have successful relationships.</b></h3><p>Personal boundaries are dynamic. For the average person, boundaries mean distinguishing one’s self, or ego (what makes me <i>me</i>), from that of others. Psychodynamic theory proclaims the “id” to be the primitive elements of desire, while the “ego” negotiates the world and its boundaries. Boundaries may be self-imposed (the “superego”) or by other authority. Sigmund Freud, the founder of the psychodynamic approach to psychology, described the human psyche as made up of these three aspects—the primitive, impulsive id; the reasonable, decision-making ego; and the superego, which incorporates the values and morals of society and seeks to mediate between the chaotically self-absorbed id and the rigidly rational ego.</p>\n<p>Boundaries can be a challenge at the best of times, but in the context of bipolar disorder, boundaries are often shattered by mood swings. At one end of the spectrum, “dilute” boundaries (overfamiliarity) can lead to dangerous situations, while at the other extreme, impenetrable boundaries can prevent loved ones from helping in times of need.</p>\n<h3><b>How do boundaries in my close relationships impact my quality of life?</b></h3><p>Personal boundaries in close relationships have many facets and directly affect illness outcomes in physical and mental health domains. The questionnaire “Experiences in Close Relationships” (ECR) measures the ability to be close with one’s partner, the capacity to share feelings and emotions and to provide and accept support, as well as negative elements, such as feeling that the partner makes one doubt oneself or having preoccupations of abandonment. The ECR is a measure of healthy boundaries in an intimate partnership and is a predictor of the degree of support a relationship will bring in the context of an illness. Secure relationships are associated with lower rates of depression in physical disorders, such as cancer. Research from our group at the University of Michigan found that social and personal relationships, including the capacity for attachment, were often compromised among people with bipolar disorder.</p>\n<p>A further point to consider is social undermining. Undermining is when others conspire (wittingly or unwittingly) to impede the success of an individual. Undermining is very destructive; it contributes to perceived boundaries and often results in failed careers and social and personal relationships. Social support is wonderful, but often no amount of social support can overcome the boundaries that undermining presents.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><b>How do you set boundaries, anyway?</b></h3><p>A practical approach to establishing boundaries can be found in business writings. William Ury’s <i>The Power of a Positive No</i> provides guidelines on how to say “No” effectively and respectfully in almost any situation, while identifying actions and strategies toward an acceptable outcome. The essence of the argument is that, for example, if a friend asks you for a personal favor that is uncomfortable, you respond with a counter offer and negotiate toward agreement, rather than responding with a blunt “No.” Naturally there are times when a more forceful “NO!” is needed, but in the course of interactions with close friends and family, this kind of response may be seen as aggressive and is liable to raise more concerns, especially when loved ones perceive a need for help.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><b>What are the top 5 things I can work on right now?</b></h3><p>Talk to a therapist about boundaries, and when and how to set them:</p>\n<p><b>1.</b> Work toward strategies for a supportive experience in your close relationships.</p>\n<p><b>2.</b> Determine whether or not boundaries are inhibiting your personal intimacy.</p>\n<p><b>3.</b> Practice the power of a positive “No.” If you are not using a “No” on at least a weekly basis, ask your therapist if perhaps you might be too agreeable and might have difficulties setting limits and boundaries.</p>\n<p><b>4.</b> Practice identifying your needs and asking someone for help.</p>\n<p><b>5.</b> If you perceive that someone is engaged in undermining your ability to succeed, work with your therapist to develop effective countermeasures.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n-----<br /><b>Melvin G.

I recognize my bipolar disorder as a sometimes agonizing clinical condition that requires medical treatment, but I also recognize it as a sometimes liberating mystical gift that requires spiritual acknowledgment.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, however, many mental health professionals and people of faith alike consider these inherently incompatible assessments, clinging instead to the false notion that an experience must be either 100 percent clinical or 100 percent spiritual in order to be considered valid as either. But life is not black and white, and for many of us living with bipolar disorder, myself included, the clinical and the spiritual can and do overlap.</p>\n<p>My first acute manic episode, for example, briefly coincided with an intense mystical experience that took me years to finally accept as such. Because my healthcare providers dismissed my ecstatic experience as pure delusion, I did too. But more recently, I have come to accept the validity of both the spiritual and the clinical components of my mental health condition, and for me, it has made a world of difference.</p>\n<p>Prayer has come to play a powerful role in my recovery. Every morning, I hand my day over to the divine presence, pledging to do my best and asking the Beloved to do the rest. So far, it has worked. Where I lack worldly patience, I’ve been blessed with spiritual perseverance and reassurance.</p>\n<p>A few weeks ago, after I presented a lecture, a fellow Muslim approached me and said, “Prayer is the only medication you need, Sister.”</p>\n<p>I’ve heard countless versions of this before, and alas, such sentiments exist within nearly every religious tradition. Whether you’re Muslim, Jewish, Christian, Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, or Baha’i, chances are you’ll one day stumble across one such misinformed fellow believer, if you haven’t already.</p>\n<p>In response to this well-meaning brother, I extolled the virtues of prayer <i>and</i> science, noting that they need not be mutually exclusive. I thanked him for his concern, however misplaced, and happily continued taking my psychiatrist’s counsel over his.</p>\n<p>Thankfully, I now see a psychiatrist who respects my beliefs, but that hasn’t always been the case. As an inpatient at one facility, for example, I had a psychiatrist who pathologized my daily prayers, calling them a sign of “hyperreligiosity.” In truth, they were symptomatic of nothing more than a healthy spiritual life and an effective coping mechanism. Nonetheless, they were misinterpreted, labeled “hyperreligious.” But there’s a big difference between being hyperreligious and being religious. Prayer and meditation are perfectly healthy and effective recovery strategies.</p>\n<p>For me, prayer has provided hope and solace amid my most painful depressions and mixed states. In that facility, for instance, I was so agitated that I couldn’t sit still for more than five minutes at first. But for the scarce minutes a day that I spent on my prayer rug, my agitation vanished, and I was blessed with a few fleeting moments of intense peace and respite.</p>\n<p>Prayer has also provided me with a much-needed routine in my everyday life. As a freelance writer, I have to make my own schedule, and while my days may vary wildly at times, I always have my worship to steady my routine, to keep me grounded, to remind me of my purpose and my principles.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, there is plenty of blame to go around when it comes to the failure of faith communities to fully respect medicine and the failure of medical communities to fully respect faith. But for those of us caught in the middle here, it’s not about blame; it’s about recovery. We just want to be as well as we can be, and we want to be able to use every tool at our disposal to reach and maintain wellness.</p>\n<p>No two paths to recovery will ever be identical, and there is no such thing as a “correct” path. In many ways, we’re all learning as we go here—and that includes our health-care providers and our faith communities. But those of us living with mental health conditions like bipolar disorder are in a special position to educate our peers and health-care providers about how to best respect the role of spirituality in our health-care plans and the role of health care in our spiritual plans. It’s high time we spoke up.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<i>-----</i><br /><i>Melody Moezzi is a writer, attorney, activist, speaker, and award-winning author, most recently of</i> Haldol and Hyacinths: A Bipolar Life<i>.

Fast</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I used to think that being alone was a strength. I grew up with the very 1980s idea that “we have to learn to be alone in order to really be with another person.” I now believe that for people with bipolar depression, the opposite is true—we need human contact to get us out of a down mood swing.</p>\n<p>Depression makes me isolate. It makes me see the phone as an instrument of torture. I turn to social media instead of reaching out to live human beings. Depression tells me that being alone is all I deserve and that life is a lonely path I travel without support or love. Wow, I’m stable as I write this and it’s obvious to me that it makes no sense. But when I’m depressed? Totally believe it. Here’s a recent example in my life:</p>\n<p><i> I’m depressed. I need contact, but I can’t reach out. I’m lying in my bed watching another British mystery while there are three messages from friends on my phone. I have the thought, “No one cares about me, which is why no one is calling me. I’m destined to be alone, lying on a bed in a dark room instead of getting out in the world. This is my life and it’s horrible.”</i></p>\n<p>What is wrong with this picture? So much! It’s not rational. At the exact moment that my brain is telling me I have no friends and will be alone forever, I have multiple messages from people who care about me and are waiting for me to respond. Surprise: depression isn’t rational.</p>\n<p>This isn’t loneliness! It’s <i>illness</i>. This is what I call “depression isolation.”</p>\n\n<div class=\"object-center\">\t\t\n\n    \n                <div class=\"imagecenter\">\n    \n    \n                                                                                                                                    <a href=https://ad.doubleclick.net/ddm/clk/303209565;130320553;q?http://www.bipolardepressionoptions.com?utm_medium=Display&amp;utm_source=Display&amp;utm_campaign=Latuda_DTC_Unbranded_Static&amp;utm_term=Display&amp;utm_content=LAT_LAT630-14&amp;http://www.latuda.com target=\"_self\">        <img src=\"/var/site_5441/storage/images/media2/images/advertisement12/35387-1-eng-GB/advertisement.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"297\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"advertisement\" title=\"advertisement\" />\n        </a>\t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n            </div>\n    \n    </div><p>My depressed brain isn’t a good reporter. It lies and tells me information that is in direct contrast to what is happening in the real world. The worst part is, when I’m depressed I listen to my ill brain instead of listening to the messages from my good friends.</p>\n<p>When I’m stable, life moves forward with ease. I answer my phone. I make plans. I don’t cry and worry and ruminate over my past. Stability is my goal in life.</p>\n<p>Here are two things I’ve taught myself to do when I realize I’m sitting alone in my room instead of interacting with life. It’s never easy, and on some days I’m lucky if I can do one, but I will always try until I’m better.</p>\n<p><b>1.</b> I turn off social media and force myself to be with human beings. I regularly have to remind myself that social media is a tool that works when I’m well, but when I’m depressed it is a horrible isolator that makes me feel much worse.</p>\n<p><b>2.</b> I focus on <i>outcome</i> instead of on my current feelings. I make myself do the opposite of what I <i>feel</i> like doing—even if it often feels worse than a root canal in the moment. But I do this in order to have a better future. I make rules like, “Julie, you will answer your phone no matter how you feel in the moment. You will say yes to invitations. You will reach out to others!” Being my own drill sergeant is what works when my brain is telling me incorrect information.</p>\n<p>If you’re depressed right now, pat yourself on the back for reading this! You have already started the process of getting out of your depression by <i>looking for help</i>. If you love someone with bipolar who is isolating, create a plan on your own and then show it to them when they are well. Go over and see them—in person, face to face. Send them a hand-written card—through the mail, not online. Slip a note under their door. Do something real to show them you’re right here whenever they come out of the fog of isolation. And most importantly, whether for yourself or for someone you love, start <i>now</i> and put a plan in place to prevent the mood swing from getting so far the next time.</p>\n<p>The ’80s were an interesting time in many ways, and I did learn to be a strong woman. But not every lesson I learned back then was right. There’s a difference between learning to be alone, and feeling isolated and unlovable. When I’m depressed, the answer to isolation is people.

While I now could be considered something of a poster boy for thriving with bipolar, for me there was no quick and fortunate return to regular life after I was diagnosed at age 20 during a severe manic episode.</p>\n<p>I had trouble finding medications that worked. I encountered doctor after doctor who failed to take my symptoms and side effects seriously. I began to feel I was facing a lifelong sentence of uncertainty and illness.</p>\n<p>For years, I saw my bipolar as something separate from me, a wild unknown with the power to render mania indistinguishable from reality and establish crippling depression as my new normal.</p>\n<p>At 22, I was still out of school, unemployed, pretty much off of medications, and opposed to new treatments because I felt I had tried every pill.</p>\n<p>I was living in my older sister’s attic. I went weeks without interacting with anyone besides her. I had gained 40 pounds, lost all interest in completing school, and abandoned hygiene to such a degree that my mother would cry whenever I allowed her to visit.</p>\n<p>I resisted any inclination towards hope, for it had disappointed me too many times. This, I was convinced, would be my life now. This was my surrender. This, ultimately, was my acceptance of illness.</p>\n<p>Somehow this complete rejection of hope, this surrender that accepted defeat, cleared the way for something, anything else.</p>\n<p>Fast forward three years: I am completing my final year at Harvard University. I work for an amazing nonprofit health agency that provides free medical and mental health care in disadvantaged communities. I am setting my sights towards graduate school.</p>\n<p>When I am asked how I moved from illness to recovery, I find it hard to summarize an answer. It is rare for a recovery journey to follow a linear path. I think of mine as a chaotic collection of relapses and rallies.</p>\n<p>Every new chapter of my recovery began with a heightened awareness of my limitations, but also of a capacity for resilience I did not know I possessed.</p>\n<p>Of course, there were decisions along the way that made a difference. I found a new doctor who believed in my ability to be successful while living with this brain-based disorder and who customized a treatment plan that worked.</p>\n<p>I started a volunteer job that turned into an English instructor position at a middle school. I slowly re-established relationships with friends who repeatedly confirmed their belief in me. Perhaps most importantly, I had a family willing to support and sustain me even when none of us understood what was happening.</p>\n<p>Accepting the reality of my rock bottom opened the door to other important forms of acceptance. While I consider myself extremely fortunate to have a second chance, so to speak, I have come to accept that this recovery business is continuous and never-ending.</p>\n<p>I have come to accept that my strengths cannot be separated from the challenges I face as a person living with bipolar. My big personality and bursts of creativity are connected to my periods of depression and self-isolation.</p>\n<p>I have come to accept that my illness is not a foreign entity attacking my body. It is a part of me that I carry equally into my psychiatrist’s office, my college classes, and my work with LGBTQ peers facing their own mental health challenges. It is something I will carry with me when I reach for my diploma at my graduation ceremony this spring.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<i>-----</i><br /><i>Miguel Garcia, a native of Detroit, received the 2016 Life Unlimited Award from the Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance.
