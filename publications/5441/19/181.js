Faced with emotions that ricochet up and down and a developmental imperative to test boundaries, it’s common for parents to wonder: “How do I handle this?”</p>\n<p>When moody extremes, irritability, sleeplessness and other symptoms merit a diagnosis of bipolar disorder, parents face an entirely new and often daunting set of challenges. Meet three families whose tenacity, resourcefulness, and most of all, love, have seen them through stormy days to calmer harbors.</p>\n<p>One family has piloted their child through adolescence into the waters of early adulthood. The others are still navigating the shoals of adolescence. They’re all sharing their stories in hopes that their hard-won wisdom will help you do the same.</p>\n<p><i><b>Editor's Note:</b> All names have been changed to ensure the privacy of minors.</i></p>\n<p class=\"pullQuote\"><b> </b></p>\n<p><i>*  *  *  *  *</i></p>\n<p class=\"pullQuote\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"pullQuote\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><b>FIGHTING FOR YOUR CHILD’S FUTURE: </b><b><i>Abby, age 15</i></b></h3><h4><b>Learning to advocate</b></h4><p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As parents of a teenager with bipolar disorder, Jane and Roger know they can’t be passive about getting appropriate care for their daughter. The Midwest couple are staunch champions for Abby, who is 15.</p>\n<p>“We may differ from ‘typical’ parents because to get the best treatment, we know we must advocate, often going nose-to-nose with doctors, therapists, educators and others if needed,” says Jane.</p>\n<p>Jane takes point in researching Abby’s condition, dealing with various professionals, and managing the home front. Roger attends to the family’s financial needs and provides emotional and practical support to his wife.</p>\n<p>“I can help by lifting the acute stresses involved in day-to-day logistics,” he says.</p>\n<p>Both parents recognize that assisting Abby is a long-term commitment, more so than in the average family. At the same time, they want to provide her with useful life skills and tools that will contribute to her independence.</p>\n<p>“We help her realize when emotions are extremely out of line compared to ‘normal,’” says her mom. “Sometimes, though, we can’t intervene if she’s just not open to it.”</p>\n<p>Abby is a highly imaginative artist and writer who is at her best when she’s outdoors. When mom and daughter spent six weeks backpacking on the Appalachian Trail, “Abby was wonderful—no anxiety or moods,” Jane reports.</p>\n<p>Roger stresses the importance of building an effective team to help their daughter.</p>\n<p>“We have had to cut ties with care providers because they just weren’t working for our family,” he says.</p>\n<p>Advocacy means respectful but firm negotiation to get what is best for their child. The goal, says Jane, is “enabling more effective collaboration.”</p>\n<p>When seeking medical providers, she begins the discussion like this: “Her dad and I know her better than anyone else, but you have specialty training that we don’t.”</p>\n<p>A voracious consumer of reliable information about bipolar, Jane draws on her acquired knowledge when weighing interventions.</p>\n<p>“If a medical provider says ‘Let’s do this,’ as if it’s the only approach, and I’m not comfortable with that option, I still want to discuss ‘x’, ‘y’ and ‘z’ as options.”</p>\n<p>Abby received a bipolar I diagnosis at age 5, so her mom has lots of experience interacting with officialdom. The family tried different educational options throughout the elementary grades, including private school, homeschooling, and part-time attendance at a school where Jane was a tutor.</p>\n<p>With Abby switching to public school in 6th grade, Jane approached school administrators to discuss accommodations her daughter was entitled to under federal law. Her requests for proper evaluation and services bore little fruit, but the tenacious mom stood her ground. After a year, Abby finally received an individualized education program (IEP).</p>\n<p>That same tenacity paid off when it came to Abby’s diagnosis, as well. When the girl’s treatments for bipolar disorder didn’t resolve all her symptoms, Jane pushed for further assessments. Identifying additional conditions, such as executive function deficits and significant anxiety, led to changes in medication and therapy aims.</p>\n<p>“Professionals may be content to stop with one diagnosis, rather than looking for the full spectrum of issues to be addressed,” she insists. “Having a complete understanding of [Abby’s] challenges means we can more effectively address these issues and more going forward.”</p>\n<p>Jane and Roger have learned that there’s no such thing as one-and-done when it comes to helping their daughter. They came to see that public school wasn’t the best sphere for Abby, even with the IEP in place. She was more anxious, had more mood swings, didn’t sleep well, and at times was suicidal. Now she is being home-schooled again, showing excellent results academically and otherwise.</p>\n<p>“We continue to work hard to understand what’s really going on with our daughter and to address each issue in a targeted way,” says Roger. “The family doesn’t hesitate to seek out the most effective solutions.”</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><b>BACK ON TRACK: </b><b><i>Jack, age 14</i></b></h3><h4><b>Improved stability takes pressure off the whole family</b></h4><p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As early as age 4, Jack told his mom that he was afraid to go into subways and elevators. He was always “a really sensitive kid,” she recalls. Yet as Eleanor and her husband remember it, their son’s behavior was “pretty typical” until he transitioned to middle school in their New England city.</p>\n<p>Not only was it a new environment, but Jack also faced bullying. He began to experience extreme anxiety and depression, and over the holiday break in sixth grade he showed symptoms of hypomania, including high irritability and excessive energy.</p>\n<p>His symptoms intensified when Jack started seventh grade. In March 2015 he received a cutting-edge diagnosis: bipolar disorder, fear of harm phenotype.</p>\n<p>This possible subtype of pediatric bipolar involves six major symptom clusters, including severe anxiety, extreme irritability, and heightened sensitivity to criticism and rejection.</p>\n<p>“Bipolar children with ‘fear of harm’ may have trouble discerning nonverbal communication—misperceiving neutral cues as threatening. We’ve been concerned about that,” says Eleanor.</p>\n<p>A novel medication regimen cemented Jack’s healing process over a period of many months, Eleanor says. She advises parents to be patient with the trial-and-error process that’s often required to find out what’s effective.</p>\n<p>Jack also benefited from attending a “small, artsy” private school. He did well academically and became more independent, his mom says, and he now “reads” other kids much better. She credits talk therapy, which helped him feel less fearful, along with his maturation in general.</p>\n<p>His mom reports that at 14 years old, Jack is back in public school, is an “A” student, has a close group of pals, and can be a “very funny” boy. During summer vacation, he was able to do two things that would have been impossible in his pre-treatment years: ride to the top of a skyscraper and get on a plane.</p>\n<p>Everything’s better on the home front, too. Eleanor uses the word “traumatic” when recalling how Jack’s unpredictable and sometimes explosive behavior affected them. His older brother, now 17, became hypervigilant—watchful for abrupt changes in behavior that would be problematic for Jack or those around him.</p>\n<p>“At first, we all walked on eggshells a bit,” says Eleanor. “Initially none of us knew what we were dealing with.”</p>\n<p>Now that Jack is less enslaved by irrational fears, Eleanor says, “it’s fun to do things as a foursome again.” The family has resumed activities like hiking and eating out.</p>\n<p>“The other night, we went for authentic Chinese food together, something we couldn’t always do,” she recalls.</p>\n<p>Improved stability has also meant reestablishing more of the usual expectations and consequences. For example, Jack has household chores like putting the clean dishes away.</p>\n<p>“It’s important to hold Jack accountable in his life,” Eleanor says.</p>\n<p>That includes setting limits on possibly risky behavior.</p>\n<p>“Children with bipolar often have a strong energy and imagination that sometimes leads to unusual pursuits and interests,” Eleanor reflects. “We have to rein some in, so we tack ‘No Trespassing’ signs on our trees in the woods. It’s a balance between letting him explore and keeping him within some bounds.”</p>\n<p>Talking to other families coping with a child who has a brain-based disorder has proven incredibly helpful.</p>\n<p>“Just being open about it, instead of hiding, and talking about it like you would a heart condition makes a real difference,” Eleanor says. “For anyone, reading and then discussing this moves us along … sharing is just better for everyone.”</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><b>On the same team: </b><b><i>Melissa, age 20</i></b></h3><h4><b>Parent and child as allies</b></h4><p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It may not seem remarkable for a young woman to be studying visual arts at her local community college north of New York City. For 20-year-old Melissa and her parents, Keri and Donny, that counts as a once-unthinkable triumph.</p>\n<p>Melissa was almost completely debilitated by bipolar symptoms when the family met psychiatrist Demitri Papolos, MD, an associate professor of clinical psychiatry at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York City and director of research at the Juvenile Bipolar Research Foundation (JBRF).</p>\n<p>Melissa was 13 at the time. The treatment she received “changed everything,” Keri says, because it provided enough stability so that behavioral interventions could take hold.</p>\n<p>“Things are still difficult, but at least now she can identify feelings, verbalize what’s going on with her, and use tools to accomplish goals. It’s a slow process for Melissa, but a process no less,” says Keri, who describes her daughter’s emotional age as “more like a 14-year-old.”</p>\n<p>Over the years, the family has instituted various methods to help Melissa self-regulate. For example, a 1-to-10 scale to rate her current emotional state, paired with a behavior “toolbox” decorated with glitter and stickers and filled with suggested activities.</p>\n<p>A rating of 5 or higher would mean it’s time to choose a tool to calm down, such as “read the dog a story,” “go sing and swing,” or “sit in a quiet tent and draw.”</p>\n<p>It’s important to have “both active and quiet options, to calm down or go use up her energy,” Keri says.</p>\n<p> The mood rating system still proves useful for Melissa, her boyfriend, and her family. So does taking “time outs”—for Keri and Donny.</p>\n<p>“When one of us is at our wit’s end, we ‘tag’ the other to prevent burnout, saying, ‘It’s your turn,’” Keri says. “I also take calming ‘mommy minutes’ on my own.”</p>\n<p>Not a bad strategy to remember in a household with two adolescents: Melissa’s younger sister is now 17.</p>\n<p>“This is tough with two teens, but we remind them they are different people with different needs and different rules,” Keri says.</p>\n<p>As Melissa gained in self-knowledge, she became more of a partner in managing her bipolar. Recognizing that holidays with her dad’s large family can be overwhelming, Melissa came up with the idea to limit the blocks of time she spends with her beloved relatives.</p>\n<p>The young woman also started doing yoga, which Keri says “really helped regulate her mood and keep her calm.” She adds that regular yoga has also improved Melissa’s sleep, “a big key to sustaining her wellness.”</p>\n<p>Melissa contributes entries to a mood journal that Keri maintains. It’s a kind of centralized data base that includes Melissa’s writing and poetry, plus “notes from doctors’ appointments about new meds, lab reports, [and] bipolar episodes,” Keri says.</p>\n<p>“This really helps us see patterns of behavior so we can all start working back toward wellness as soon as she starts to slip.”</p>\n<p>Developing skills to communicate calmly and honestly has been important. It’s something they try to practice even during testy disagreements between daughter and parents.</p>\n<p>“No one likes being wrong, but we both remain open to correction from each other,” Keri says.</p>\n<p>When things go verbally awry, they have a “do-over” policy that applies to everyone equally.</p>\n<p>“You can restate something that you said meanly or rudely,” says Keri. “It helps model the correct way to ask or say things.”</p>\n<p>Keri says she and Donny work hard to stay on the same page with Melissa.</p>\n<p>“Now Melissa makes her own friends and her own plans,” Keri explains, “so we just help her modify and figure out what she can handle.”</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<i>-----</i><br /><i>Stephanie Stephens is a freelance journalist based in Southern California and an audio/video producer specializing in health and lifestyle topics.

Flanigan</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>AFTER A COLOSSAL FIGHT with your honey, you head out for the night and end up getting too cozy with some random guy at the bar. Or your boss offers constructive criticism that you take to be more criticizing than constructive, so you say spiteful things about her to co-workers.</p>\n<p>Everyone has impulsive tendencies at times. Who hasn’t acted on a whim without thinking it through or gotten carried away by an exciting idea?</p>\n<p>In some situations, the ability to act boldly may be desirable—it’s what entrepreneurs rely on, after all. More often, it can result in troubling and even dangerous consequences, especially when it’s amplified by hypomania or mania.</p>\n<p>Impulsivity and elevated mood go hand in hand. In fact, pursuing risky behaviors that have a high potential for negative outcomes is one of the symptoms used to diagnose hypo/mania. However, a body of research suggests that even in times of stability, lower impulse control is characteristic of adults with bipolar.</p>\n<p>Based on emotion rather than logical reasoning, impulsivity is an urge to act without regard for the future. Whether it’s saying whatever comes into your head or deciding to move to Australia <i>right now</i>, the results can be devastating: fractured relationships, lost jobs, staggering debt, compromised health, legal troubles, and on and on.</p>\n<p>Relatively minor behaviors associated with impulsivity—including impatience and interrupting when others speak—can alienate those around you. There’s also a link between weak impulse control and explosive anger.</p>\n<p>Studies suggest that the part of the brain that plans and analyzes tends to have a weaker grip on emotional circuitry in people with bipolar—akin to worn brake pads that can’t stop a speeding car in time.</p>\n<p>In addition, the reward system seems to be more sensitive, so that the lure of a prize wields more power. On the one hand, that hyperactivity can fuel goal-directed achievement; on the other, it increases susceptibility to addiction and intensifies cravings for excitement.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>‘PAUSE AND PONDER’</h3><p>When dealing with bipolar, it’s always good to remember this motto: “Biology is not destiny.” That said, you may need stronger external circuit breakers to help you pause and ponder when your inner voice says “Go for it!”</p>\n<p>Deby Spicuzza of Virginia has wrestled with pinpointing the difference between impulsivity and intuition.</p>\n<p>“I’ve had to learn to identify which risks are smart and educated and thought-through, and which are the superficial result of hypomania,” says Spicuzza, who has bipolar II.</p>\n<p>“Hypomania can make even the worst idea feel pretty special, but I’ve discovered that impulses can be one-trick ponies.… They often don’t have any substance beneath them.”</p>\n<p>Spicuzza doesn’t want to entirely give up her reputation for being “wacky and quirky,” but she now prefers what she calls “the much less exciting, but far more grounded responsibility of commitment.”</p>\n\n<div class=\"object-center\">\t\t\n\n    \n                <div class=\"imagecenter\">\n    \n    \n                                                                                                                                    <a href=https://ad.doubleclick.net/ddm/clk/303209565;130319642;x?http://www.bipolardepressionoptions.com?utm_medium=Display&amp;utm_source=Display&amp;utm_campaign=Latuda_DTC_Unbranded_Static&amp;utm_term=Display&amp;utm_content=LAT_LAT630-14&amp;http://www.latuda.com target=\"_self\">        <img src=\"/var/site_5441/storage/images/media2/images/advertisement9/35366-1-eng-GB/advertisement.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"297\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"advertisement\" title=\"advertisement\" />\n        </a>\t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n            </div>\n    \n    </div><p>Impetuously chasing some perceived jackpot of the moment has caused Spicuzza problems. She recalls one incident that tested her relationship with a good friend who was her roommate at the time.</p>\n<p>The other woman had just broken up with her boyfriend and Spicuzza intended to be there to provide comfort. On the way home, she found out that another friend’s band was playing at a local club. She figured she’d just peek in to say hi, but when she arrived someone in line offered her a ticket to the sold-out show. It seemed like kismet, so Spicuzza blew off her grieving girlfriend.</p>\n<p>“I felt like I was supposed to be at this show, not keeping this pretty special commitment to my friend,” she explains.</p>\n<p>Spicuzza realizes now that the situation “wasn’t this magical moment when the stars aligned so I could see this guy in this band. It was just me giving in to an impulsive act.”</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>ACCOUNTABILITY</h3><p>Impulsive behavior and unfiltered speech can leave a wake of hurt, angry and bewildered people. Then it’s time to deal with the guilt and regrets, while hoping that apologies and making amends will repair any rifts.</p>\n<p>Andy L. who lives in the state of Washington, is working on recognizing how his behavior affects those around him. In the moment, it’s often a challenge to stop and consider whether his actions might be unwelcome.</p>\n<p>“I don’t realize how inappropriate and uncomfortable I’m making the other person,” he says. “I’m so delighted not to care.”</p>\n<p>During his last hypomanic episode, for example, he abruptly decided to give away some of his possessions to family members.</p>\n<p>While they were out of the house, the musician set up his electronic drum set in his son’s room and gathered together a batch of his old recordings for his wife. Having read somewhere of an association between Buddhists and tangerines, he placed a fruit in each bedroom as a sign of gratitude.</p>\n<p>Andy recalls: “My family was like, ‘Yeah, I don’t want this. Thanks.’ It was all very benign, but also irritating and nutty to them.”</p>\n<p>Andy has learned not to keep his impulsive feelings to himself. He used to let them out only on a private notepad, which helped him sort out his thoughts but didn’t provide an outside perspective. Now he also turns to his wife, Kristin, a psychotherapist.</p>\n<p>“I have a partner I can trust and who isn’t afraid of this,” he says. “It’s a good idea to have somebody who can check your reality…. I can say, ‘Am I being weird? Are you feeling uncomfortable?’”</p>\n<p>It’s definitely helpful to have a person—whether a mental health professional or someone close whom you trust—who can steer you away from impetuous behavior.</p>\n<p>Cognitive-behavioral skills and mindfulness practices can also be immensely useful in slowing down impulsive responses.</p>\n<p>Stuart Moore, a licensed clinical social worker in Northern Virginia, guides clients in how to pause long enough to weigh the pros and cons of a particular impulse.</p>\n<p>“That pause, that reflective moment, takes the [situation] away from impulsivity to a conscious decision,” he says. “That doesn’t mean we need to take it off the table, but maybe we can take it off the table for right now.”</p>\n<p>Some people impose a mandatory waiting period on taking any action to see if it still seems like a good idea in a week, say. That sifts out the promising proposals from mere whims.</p>\n<p>Says Moore, “At some point the impulse is no longer necessary. It’s moved on.”</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>FINDING FAIL-SAFES</h3><p> Melissa Calhoun describes herself as “a fly-by-the-seat-of-my-pants kind of person.” The Canadian woman, who has bipolar I, is apt to make decisions with little forethought—whether shopping on eBay when she’s depressed or hypomanic or making major life changes in times of stress.</p>\n<p>“Predominantly I know it’s a bad thing [to do] but act on it anyway because I give myself excuses in my head,” she says of her impulsive tendencies. “And sometimes I don’t know it’s a bad idea and it’s an absolute loss of control.”</p>\n<p>When Calhoun’s husband left their marriage, she responded—the next day—by starting to date a friend she had known for nearly a decade.</p>\n<p>“He came over to make sure I was OK, and never left,” she recalls. “Should I have been dating yet? Probably not.”</p>\n<p>Recognizing her behavior patterns lets her build in some fail-safes. Because she knows she’s prone to overspending, Calhoun hands her bank card over to her boyfriend when the two go out on the town. He also helped her develop a monthly budget intended to keep her finances stable.</p>\n<p>Still, such measures aren’t foolproof. One Maryland man with bipolar I has trouble abiding by spending limits established by his wife.</p>\n<p>Once when George took his teenage daughter to the mall, he spent upwards of $500 instead of the approved amount of $50, “buying clothes, and doing silly things like buying five appetizers before our meal came out,” he remembers. “I was just happy to see my daughter happy.”</p>\n<p>In his case, removing temptation has yielded better results. George deactivated most of his social media accounts to cut down on the number of comments he posts without the proper mental filtering.</p>\n<p>Those kind of posts frequently cause friction with his wife, which then prompts him to say “horrific things,” which then leaves him angry at himself, which then feeds back into spontaneous online vents.</p>\n<p>“It’s a vicious cycle,” he says. “It’s definitely not worth the problems it causes, so now I just primarily use Twitter for news feeds until I get my stuff under control.”</p>\n<p>Spicuzza carries a small charm with her as a reminder that when it comes to the allure of impulse, she has been down that path before. The charm is a unicorn; it came on a necklace she bought for a pricey-for-her $50. At the time, she felt there was something meaningful and poignant about it.</p>\n<p>“Impulse will show you a lot of unicorns,” she reflects, “so keeping one with me is a reminder that impulse feels special and significant, but ultimately it’s [about] illusions.</p>\n<p> When an impulsive urge stirs, Spicuzza turns to the charm for a mental prompt.</p>\n<p>“I recognize this feeling,” she tells herself. “I’ve been here before. It’ll pass.”</p>\n<p class=\"ezoeAligncenter text-center\">*  *  *  *  *</p>\n\n<div>\n<table bgcolor=\"#eeeeee\">\n<tr>\n    <td>\n    <h3><b>CONTROL PANEL</b></h3><p><b>Developing strategies for dialing back impulsive urges will lead to more stability and healthier choices.

Thase, MD. “Even something as simple as counting to 10, under your breath, before you respond can have beneficial impact.” Other tips: Write a list of pros and cons before making a tough decision; conduct research on a potential purchase before getting your money involved; mentally rehearse what you want to say before you say it.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n    </td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n</div>\n<div>\n<table bgcolor=\"#eeeeee\">\n<tr>\n    <td>\n    <h3><b>THOUGHT POLICE</b></h3><p>Assessment tools used to rate impulsivity sometimes laser down to distinct aspects such as <b>MOTOR IMPULSIVITY</b> (rash actions), <b>NONPLANNING IMPULSIVITY</b> (not taking the future into account), <b>TEMPORAL IMPULSIVITY</b> (the drive for immediate gratification), and <b>COGNITIVE IMPULSIVITY</b> (jumpy thinking).

Flanigan</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>SCIENTISTS AROUND THE WORLD are trying to understand the roots of impulsivity and impulse control disorders (a category that includes pathological gambling and kleptomania). There is even an International Society for Research on Impulsivity, founded to promote collaborative study.</p>\n<p>Like most human behavior, impulsivity involves complex interactions—how we respond to potential rewards, how we weigh risks, how well we can override emotions with rational reflection (otherwise known as inhibition).</p>\n<p>And those factors may not stay static: According to one psychological theory, the quality known as willpower fluctuates due to fatigue, diet, environment, and our own beliefs.</p>\n<p>In people with bipolar disorder, emotional regulation also fluctuates with mood shifts.</p>\n<p>According to Michael E. Thase, MD, a professor of psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania and a physician at the Philadelphia VA Medical Center, we each have an innate baseline ability to resist emotional impulses, which varies from person to person.</p>\n<p>During depressive and hypo/manic episodes, however, that individual default setting goes haywire. Changes in mood are associated with changes in brain activity that can reduce the “inhibitory, thoughtful override that could otherwise rein in spontaneous—and possibly dangerous, even life-threatening—decisions,” Thase explains.</p>\n<p>“This might involve things that are rewarding or feel good, like sex, or using drugs, or spending money, or gambling.”</p>\n<p>In depression, Thase adds, it may be associated with impulsive suicidal behavior.</p>\n<p>Various regions of the brain interact when we make decisions. One area of focus is the nucleus accumbens and its role in the brain’s reward system. This structure helps govern how we react to pleasurable stimuli, mediating the release of dopamine and serotonin.</p>\n<p> When British researchers had a group of people with bipolar perform a roulette-style task, they showed stronger activation in the nucleus accumbens than a comparison group of people without bipolar.</p>\n<p>That 2014 study also found different patterns of activity within an area called the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (roughly, a “forward and middle” segment) that is active when we are weighing risk versus reward.</p>\n<p>Those with bipolar had greater neural activity for risky bets, while those in the comparison group showed more response to “safe” bets.</p>\n<p>The ventromedial prefrontal cortex has been implicated in other behaviors that involve deciding between future consequences and immediate pleasure, such as overeating, overspending, and substance overuse.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, a neighboring area called the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (“forward and left”) may be “increasingly relevant to our understanding of impulsivity, particularly in people with bipolar disorder,” says Mary L. Phillips, MD, director of the Mood and Brain Laboratory at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine.</p>\n<p>In certain situations where a big reward is possible, such as gambling, ventrolateral activity is heightened significantly more in people with bipolar disorder than in those without bipolar.</p>\n<p>Futhermore, Phillips and her colleagues have found that the excitement associated with the possibility of a future reward increases disproportionately during mania, feeding even more juice to emotional urges and compromising the ability to regulate them—much as floodwaters may overwhelm a normally sturdy dam.</p>\n<p>“These series of vulnerabilities often lead to risky decisions,” Phillips notes.</p>\n<p>Phillips is studying how to change the way the brain is wired. The project involves a brain stimulation technique intended to tamp down activity in the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex when anticipating a future reward.</p>\n<p>“This could be the first step toward treatment for the underlying brain causes of impulsivity,” she says.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<div>\n<table bgcolor=\"#eeeeee\">\n<tr>\n    <td>\n    <h3>Who's the boss?</h3><p>The prefrontal cortex overlays the frontal lobe of the brain and accounts for roughly 12 percent of the organ’s total volume. It is the reasoning part of the brain, central to decision-making, planning, and memory.</p>\n<p>It’s also crucial to regulating regions of the brain involved in generating emotions (notably the amygdala) and the motivation/reward system (including the nucleus accumbens).</p>\n<p>There’s strong evidence that in people with bipolar, the prefrontal cortex doesn’t always communicate properly with those areas, especially during mood episodes. This makes impulsive behavior more likely, much as the laxer supervision of a substitute teacher allows a classroom of rowdy kids to get out of control.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n    </td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n</div>","layout":{},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":0,"link_source":"","competition":[],"flatplan_title":"","notes":"","gutter_credit":"","other":"","image":[{"id":"dd8006c56bb5866f8c89603d72eaa25b","name":"bipolar-brain-impulsivity","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_5441/storage/images/media2/images/bipolar-brain-impulsivity/35105-1-eng-GB/bipolar-brain-impulsivity.jpg?t=default_ipad_portrait&ext/bipolar-brain-impulsivity_default_ipad_portrait.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"768","height":"459","legacy_id":"3287","is_default":true},{"id":"dd8006c56bb5866f8c89603d72eaa25b","name":"bipolar-brain-impulsivity","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_5441/storage/images/media2/images/bipolar-brain-impulsivity/35105-1-eng-GB/bipolar-brain-impulsivity.jpg?t=default_ipad_landscape&ext/bipolar-brain-impulsivity_default_ipad_landscape.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"1024","height":"612","legacy_id":"3287","is_default":false}],"url_alias":"http://bpmagazine.audiencemedia.com","type":"story","order":"13","folio_number":"25","folio_numbers":"25","pdf_page_index":"25","thumbnail":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_5441/storage/images/media2/images/bipolar-brain-impulsivity/35105-1-eng-GB/bipolar-brain-impulsivity.jpg?t=tablet_story_thumbnail&ext/bipolar-brain-impulsivity_tablet_story_thumbnail.jpg","color":"FFFFFF","real_id":"3174","main_section_id":"181","ads":[]},{"id":"zinio_19_bpmagus170401_article_027_01_1490200494.1567","title":"Impulsivity: An Ounce of Prevention","sub_title":"","author":[{"id":"0","name":"","email":"noreply@audiencemedia.com","is_default":false}],"tag":"","strap_line":"SOUNDOFF!","intro":"","body":"<h3>The bipolar symptom of impulsivity can upend your life in ways both large and small. What helps you stay away from rash decisions? And if impulsivity wins, how do you handle the aftermath?</h3><p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>*  *  *  *  *</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\nNOW THAT I KNOW what my triggers are, I have learned to somewhat prevent impulsivity through self-talk. I have learned that when I start to feel elevated while shopping and I am grabbing lots of stuff I don’t need, I stop and breathe a few times, and tell my mind to be calm. I remind myself that I don’t really need the items (usually makeup). I might say for example, “Yes, nice eye shadow, but you have that shade at home.” It usually works! When impulsivity wins, I remind myself that I am challenged at times by my illness, and I try to learn other ways to prevent making these impulsive decisions.<br /><b>—Charlotte Stanton,</b> BELLEVUE, NE</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\nFOR ME, THE GUILT from past impulsivity is what gives me that momentary pause before saying or doing something rash.<br /><b>—D.P.</b> via facebook</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\nI REMIND MYSELF that during my cycles I don’t make any important decisions or have any important conversations. I journal, journal and journal. I am open with others in saying I cannot make a decision at this time or have this conversation right now. If I do indulge in impulsive decisions I am totally accountable for my actions and words and make immediate amends. That alone helps me not give in to impulsiveness.<br /><b>—Laurie Althouse,</b> TULSA, OK</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\nI WORK HARD to fight my thinking in order to delay the decision, examine the choices, and evaluate where I am with my mood. Sometimes I bounce my wants off a friend to see if they sound unreasonable.<br /><b>—S.E.,</b> HARTLAND, WI</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\nKNOWING ALL I CAN about my symptoms and educating myself about every aspect of bipolar disorder helps a great deal. When I notice impulsivity, I talk with someone about what I’m feeling. I also avoid putting myself in situations of compromise. Yes, impulses can sometimes gain the upper hand. When this happens, I take responsibility for my actions. That’s very important, as is understanding I will make mistakes at times, as we all do. So I understand I’m not perfect, but through the process I can learn a great deal, which helps me to cope and continue moving forward on my journey.<br /><b>—Billy Liebrum</b> ELDON, MO</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\nI’VE LEARNED TO ASK, “What would Rick/Bruce/Rob do in this situation?” They are trusted “normal” friends whose behavior seems so boring when I’m manic, but in reality is a great yardstick or guide for what I should do.<br /><b>—P.S.,</b> AUSTRALIA</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\nI HAVE GOTTEN tattoos on impulse, shaved my head, made large purchases, and the list goes on. Now my husband helps to keep me in check. We’ve set up healthy boundaries so that I don’t continue to make similar mistakes in my future. Having a great support system really is my saving grace.<br /><b>—T.A.,</b> HODGENVILLE, KY</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\nMY PRE-DIAGNOSIS, pre-treatment behavior caused me to lose friends, boyfriends, ruin my credit, ruin my job history from self-destructive behavior and temper and impulsivity. I had a lot of wild/crazy experiences on my highs. I was kind of amazed I made it to age 30! The impulsiveness made for a lot of fun stories to tell (and to live), and people thought it was awesome, but they didn’t know about the illness behind it and the absolute life ruin that came with those experiences. Thank God for the meds!<br /><b>—J.S.</b> via facebook</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\nMY BEST WAY to solve the consequences of my impulsivity is to admit I did something wrong and apologize to the person who was affected. If I can replace whatever was damaged, I will. In addition, I will inform my doctor and ask for a stronger dosage of whichever medication my psychiatrist deems better suited to reduce or eliminate the impulsivity, if possible. Whenever I feel agitated, I know I will be impulsive as well. That’s when I climb on my treadmill and get as much energy as I can out of my system, hoping to control both agitation and impulsivity.<br />—<b>Eva Spencer,</b> GREENSBORO, NC</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\nMY IMPULSIVENESS IS part of what led to my bipolar II diagnosis in June 2016. I was spending money way outside of my means; I was having promiscuous, unprotected sex with strangers; and at the same time, I was drinking excessively (which ultimately turned into alcoholism). The easiest way to keep my impulses under control has been cutting out the alcohol completely. Everyone knows alcohol lowers inhibitions, which is the last thing you want if you already have a hard time controlling your impulses.<br /><b>—E.H.,</b> GLEN BURNIE, MD</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\nI THINK ONE OF the things that has helped me is to try to talk myself out of the impulse. I tell myself that it will pass and that I can still make a rational thought even though my body is telling me otherwise.<br /><b>—Daniela Molina Pineda,</b> COCONUT CREEK, FL</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\nMY IMPULSIVITY IS SPECIFIC to spending money on items that, at the time, I convince myself I will zealously use. Then two to three months later my interests switch. By then, it’s too late to return the items. There are three ways I try to protect myself. First and most importantly, I see my psychologist every two weeks. Next, I try to remember that three years ago I spent more than $40,000 within six or seven months. Today I can’t account for half that money. I had to remortgage my house and now I’m handcuffed to about $150 per week after mortgage, utilities, food and such. Finally, I “phantom shop” on the Internet. I fill up the shopping cart, then empty it a couple of months later.<br /><b>—Vijay Patel,</b> PORT ELGIN, ON</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\nTO PREVENT IMPULSIVE SPEAKING, I have a rule for myself: Never be in a discussion or argument after 10 p.m. When I am tired, it is much more difficult for me to stay calm. And any time I am angry or upset about something, I wait until the next day. The same for shopping for clothes or grocery shopping: If I am tired, upset or hungry, I tend to buy too much and come home with a lot of stuff which I do not need. I try to do my shopping in the morning.<br /><b>—Els Jansman,</b> FRANCE</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\nI WENT TO SOUTH FLORIDA for vacation and less than a month later me and my now-hubby had moved! Turned out to be the best decision I’ve ever made, but it was literally made by me winning rock, paper, scissors! Got married while we lived there and have so many fun newlywed memories. Once we decided to start a family we moved home, but I still miss living blocks from the beach.<br /><b>—L.C.</b> via facebook</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\nI HAVE HAD EPISODES where I was suckered into the thrill. The aftermath is really horrible. It’s often guilt, regret, self-loathing, hate. You have to live through that remorse and pray that you handle it differently next time. I am sure to stay on my medicine, which is key in managing bipolar disorder.<br /><b>—Roja Kisten,</b> JOHANNESBURG, SOUTH AFRICA</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\nIMPULSIVITY UNCHECKED put me $30,000 in debt with credit cards. I had to file for bankruptcy. For several years after the bankruptcy I could only use cash in hand to pay for anything I wanted. I eventually learned to stop tempting myself. I stopped looking at sales advertisements. If I could not keep my impulsivity in check, I would go to a store and walk around with a shopping cart and fill it with stuff I did not need. Then, I would tell myself I didn’t need anything and I would walk out of the store without making a purchase. I call it “ghost shopping.”<br /><b>—Timothy Glover</b> CHESTER, VA</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\nI ALWAYS GET IN TROUBLE when I am impulsive, usually when I’m hypomanic. Once I ended up in Hawaii with a guy I just met the day before. That’s how bad it gets. What helps me stay away from rash decisions? My husband helps me stay focused and make safe and sane decisions. If impulsivity wins? It’s embarrassing. It takes extra time to go back and clear the mess I have caused from not thinking things out. Living with bipolar I is always an interesting journey, and impulsivity is just a part of it.<br /><b>—Wendy Barry-Breier,</b> OAKLAND, CA</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\nI NEVER BUY ANYTHING unless my wife

James</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>When it comes to exercising, Newton’s first law of motion says it all: A body at rest stays at rest until an outside force acts on it. Or to put it another way: It’s a lot easier to come up with excuses not to exercise than it is to overcome our natural inertia and get moving.</p>\n<p>Personal trainers have heard ’em all: “I just had my hair done.” “I don’t like to sweat.” “I don’t have the right clothes.”</p>\n<p>When you’re living with bipolar disorder, the reasons can get a lot more serious: “This depressive episode is sapping my will.” “I’ve gained so much weight on this medication.” “I’m on disability, so I can’t afford a gym membership.”</p>\n<p>Once you get around those roadblocks, though, your physical, mental and emotional well-being is bound to improve. In fact, mental health experts increasingly recommend thinking of physical activity as another pillar of your treatment plan, on par with your medication regimen.</p>\n<p>Why should moving more be part of your wellness program? For one thing, it’s a natural antidepressant. Heaps of research link exercise to improved mood—both as an immediate pick-me-up and by reducing the risk of future depressive episodes—and stronger resilience, which is the ability to handle stress.</p>\n<p>(The majority of studies have focused on major depressive disorder, but those involving bipolar depression show similar results. One caveat: Exercise and elevated mood gets trickier because taking “goal-directed activity” to extremes is an aspect of mania.)</p>\n<p>Scientists are trying to puzzle out just how exercise combats depression. One promising candidate is a brain protein called brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). In addition to playing a crucial role in maintaining and creating neurons, BDNF appears to have antidepressant effects.</p>\n<p>Physical activity spurs the production of BDNF— not to mention improving oxygen and nutrient flow to your brain.</p>\n<p>Researchers wrangle over “exercise dose,” meaning how hard you need to exercise and for how long in order to gain mood benefits. One thing is clear: Any physical activity is better than none. And once you’ve found a way to get your body in motion, you’re more likely to keep building on that step by step.</p>\n<p>To help you get the ball rolling, we’ve put together a rundown of common exercise roadblocks and proven ways to overcome them.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<div class=\"object-center\">\t\t\n\n    \n                <div class=\"imagecenter\">\n    \n    \n                                                                                                                                    <a href=https://ad.doubleclick.net/ddm/clk/303209565;130319642;x?http://www.bipolardepressionoptions.com?utm_medium=Display&amp;utm_source=Display&amp;utm_campaign=Latuda_DTC_Unbranded_Static&amp;utm_term=Display&amp;utm_content=LAT_LAT630-14&amp;http://www.latuda.com target=\"_self\">        <img src=\"/var/site_5441/storage/images/media2/images/advertisement10/35373-1-eng-GB/advertisement.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"297\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"advertisement\" title=\"advertisement\" />\n        </a>\t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n            </div>\n    \n    </div><p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><b>ROADBLOCK 1: I don’t have time.</b></h3><p>This is arguably the most common excuse for not working out. The solution: Rethink your expectations.</p>\n<p>“We always hear the ‘no time’ excuse but ... people say they have no time because they describe exercise in a very strict way,” says Kathleen Trotter, a Toronto-based personal trainer and author of <i>Finding Your Fit: A Compassionate Trainer’s Guide to Making Fitness a Lifelong Habit.</i></p>\n<p>“You may not have time to go to the gym, but you always have time to build movement into your life.”</p>\n<p>Trotter recommends structuring tidbits of physical activity into your daily routine. For example, “getting a colleague and going for a 20-minute walk at lunch, or doing calisthenics when you watch TV.”</p>\n<p>Again, any little bit of activity is better than none. You might start with something as simple as pacing whenever you talk on the phone or doing one jumping jack every time you go to the bathroom.</p>\n<p>Bottom line: “Make movement a nonnegotiable,” Trotter says.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><b>ROADBLOCK 2: I’m too tired.</b></h3><p> As with “no time,” the answer here is to shift your perspective—namely, lower your standards when necessary.</p>\n<p>“You might not have enough energy to go to the gym, but you may have energy to follow the 10-minute rule,” says Trotter.</p>\n<p>About that “rule” she’s referring to: It just means doing something physical—anything—for 10 minutes. Even 10 minutes of walking around your house or doing some gentle stretches counts, and it’s better than giving up altogether.</p>\n<p>Once you’re moving, that 10 minutes may turn into a longer session.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><b>ROADBLOCK 3: I hate to exercise.</b></h3><p>You may be tapping into negative associations, such as suffering through gym class or being picked last for a team.</p>\n<p>“People fear exercise because of [how physical education] is approached in school,” asserts Pete McCall, MS, a fitness educator based in San Diego, California and a spokesman for the American Council on Exercise.</p>\n<p>The trick here is to substitute “pleasant” for “painful” by thinking about what physical activities would be more enjoyable for you.</p>\n<p>Consider ways you used to have fun. Did you love riding your bike as a kid? See if you can borrow a bicycle and pedal around the neighborhood. Was Frisbee a favorite, way back when? Invite a friend to toss a disc with you.</p>\n<p>Be open to new opportunities. If someone suggests you come along to a yoga class, why not see how it goes?</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><b>ROADBLOCK 4: I’m too out of shape.</b></h3><p>Almost everyone has body shame of some kind or another. When you’re self-conscious, keep in mind that people generally are more interested in their own bodies— and their own workouts—than in checking out yours.</p>\n<p>Ironically, people often decide to start exercising because of body image—as in, wanting a “better” appearance. Given our human preference for immediate gratification, however, the lure of future buffness isn’t always enough to overcome exercise inertia.</p>\n<p>“There’s so much emphasis on how exercise should make you look,” notes McCall. “Instead, think about how it makes you feel.”</p>\n<p>Focusing on the way physical activity relieves stress or staying aware of your boost in mood right afterward not only provides immediate emotional payback, but also reinforces intrinsic motivation, the inner inclination to do something.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><b>ROADBLOCK 5: I don’t know how to get started.</b></h3><p>Experts recommend a combination of aerobic activity (the kind that raises your heartbeat) and resistance training (activities that strengthen your muscles). Feeling like you don’t know the right way to go about that can be daunting.</p>\n<p>“People just don’t know what to do when it comes to exercise and fitness,” says McCall. “There’s almost too much information about what we should be doing. Too much information leads to paralysis, and it’s easier to do nothing.”</p>\n<p>A little online research can turn up easy-to-do ideas that don’t require a gym membership, such as bicep curls while holding soup cans or pushups against the wall—or simply standing up and sitting back down a few times in a row.</p>\n<p>“A little bit of something is better than a lot of nothing,” says McCall.</p>\n<p>If you’re ready (and financially able) for the next level, an ACE-certified personal trainer can develop an individualized workout plan—and help you stay with it, as well.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><b>ROADBLOCK 6: I never stick with a workout program.</b></h3><p>You have the best of intentions—but a week or two in, you lose steam and start skipping your planned activity. Discouraged, you decide to quit altogether.</p>\n<p>One way to avoid the cycle of doom: Start with a reasonable plan that fits with your lifestyle and current fitness level.</p>\n<p>“Your goals have to be specific, small, and attainable,” says health coach Danielle Vindez, MA, of Redondo Beach, California. “Once you are confident that you can meet those small goals, you can move on to making them bigger.”</p>\n<p>If you’re just easing into a routine, your goal might be to walk three times a week, for 20 minutes each time. That’s it.</p>\n<p>And if you miss a session? Let it go and refocus on—or refine—your plan.</p>\n<p>“There’s no perfect day or perfect week,” says Trotter. “Perfect is the enemy of done, so stop trying to find the ‘perfect’ way to work out … do what you can.”</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><b>ROADBLOCK 7: I just don’t feel like it.</b></h3><p>When the apathy of bipolar depression creeps in, it’s easy to say “no” to everything, including exercise. You’re also more likely to isolate yourself. Address both issues by enlisting an exercise buddy.</p>\n<p>Ask a friend to commit to working out with you, whether it’s meeting for an exercise class or walking in a nearby park. Making a commitment to someone else makes you more likely to stick with it, says Trotter.</p>\n<p>You might also consider setting up a reward system—dangling a carrot, so to speak. For example, promise to treat yourself to a new CD after following your exercise plan for two weeks, a new set of headphones after six weeks, and so on.</p>\n<p>The idea of a prize gives you an external reason to do something—also known as extrinsic motivation—and may be the extra little bump you need when you’re just not feeling it.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><b>ROADBLOCK 8: Exercise is boring.</b></h3><p>According to Vindez, one reason people get bored with exercise is that they’re not emotionally engaged in what they’re doing.</p>\n<p>“Martin Seligman, the founder of positive psychology, described five pillars of well-being that create emotional engagement for people,” she explains. Namely: positive emotions, relationships, engagement, meaning and achievement.</p>\n<p>Reflecting on activities you’ve enjoyed in the past can help you pinpoint what you value, which can help you identify similar activities that would keep your interest.</p>\n<p>For example, did shooting hoops in the driveway make you feel more relaxed? You’re connecting with positive emotions. Did playing catch with your kids put a smile on your face? You’re plugging into relationships. Did you love the absorption you had during yoga practice? That’s a sense of engagement.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><b>ROADBLOCK 9: I have physical health conditions.</b></h3><p>Sure, that adds to the challenge—but it doesn’t have to be a deal-breaker.</p>\n<p>“It’s already hard [for anyone] to work out, and if you have any kind of added impediment, you will have a more uphill battle,” admits Trotter. “So it’s important to come up with strategies that will work for you.”</p>\n<p>Consult with your doctor about any restrictions or limitations you may have, including the possible impact of any medications you’re taking. Then consider what you can do rather than what you cannot. If you have arthritis, running may be out of the question, but you can still walk, bike, or swim.</p>\n<p>Recognize that just as you have good days and bad days with bipolar, you’ll probably have good and bad days with other conditions as well. It’s better to adapt your activities as needed than to give up altogether.</p>\n<p>“Your action plan has to be more targeted to your life and your reality,” says Trotter.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><b>ROADBLOCK 10: I feel too awful to exercise.</b></h3><p>When you’re feeling depressed, anxious, irritable, or hopeless, moving your body may be the last thing you want to do—yet that’s exactly when you need it the most.</p>\n<p>“The worse your mood, the more important your workout is,” explains Trotter. “Say you measure your mood on a scale from 1 to 10. If you start your workout at an 8, there’s only so much better you can feel. But when you start at a 1, you have so much room to feel better.”</p>\n<p>Instead of thinking about how bad you feel right now, focus on how much better you’ll feel later on.
