Boorstin has been honest about his bipolar throughout an impressive career","body":"<p class=\"byline\">By Denise Mann, MS</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Early on in what would become an illustrious career, policy wonk Robert O. Boorstin made a somewhat startling revelation to a colleague.</p>\n<p>As he recalls it: “I told a young woman who I was working with that some day she may get a strange call from the police or hospital that something weird is going on with me. I said, ‘Here is my shrink’s name and number. Call him immediately when this happens.’”</p>\n<p>At the time, Boorstin was working for the presidential campaign of then Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis. Boorstin had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder six months before, at the age of 27.</p>\n<p>Boorstin did go on to experience a psychotic break and thankfully, his colleague did as he had asked.</p>\n<p>The details of that episode remain muddied for Boorstin, now 57. He knows he was taken to Massachusetts General Hospital and then transferred to McLean Hospital, a prominent psychiatric facility in the Boston area, where he was stabilized with medications. However, that’s not the end of the story he shared during his keynote speech at the Brain &amp; Behavior Research Foundation’s 28th annual International Mental Health Research Symposium in New York City.</p>\n<p>Boorstin later learned that his health insurer refused to cover his stay at McLean because he had reached his lifetime limit on mental health care. McLean “declined to take me until they got the guarantee of the $18,000 [fee] from my brother,” he explained during an interview with <i>bp Magazine</i> after his talk.</p>\n<p>Small wonder that Boorstin has become a champion of mental health parity in insurance coverage, as well as an advocate for awareness and acceptance of brain-based disorders—especially relating to workplace and career issues.</p>\n<p>“When something really bad happens to you, you have three choices: denial, pity or action,” Boorstin said. “Denial doesn’t come very naturally to me. Pity? Well, I tried that and it came fairly naturally to me.”</p>\n<p>It was anger at the way health insurance worked that helped turn his self-pity into action. His first move: “I hired lawyers in Boston and eventually won a settlement.”</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><b>AN OPEN CASE</b></h3><p>About a month after that episode, Boorstin was back on the job with the Dukakis campaign—right through to the bitter end in November 1988.</p>\n<p>Many colleagues questioned why he would be so open about having bipolar, Boorstin recalled in his talk. “They asked, ‘Why would you be so stupid as to talk about something that personal, that embarrassing and that potentially harmful to your career?’”</p>\n<p>The answer was fairly simple: “I wanted to prove to people that you could have the illness and yet function at a high-pressure job,” said Boorstin, who is now a senior vice president at Albright Stonebridge Group, a global consultancy firm in Washington, DC.</p>\n<p>According to a 2000 study from Boston University’s Center for Psychiatric Rehabilitation, out of 500 professionals and managers in a range of occupations who were dealing with a serious mental illness, fully 73 percent were employed.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, 62 percent of respondents had held their current position for more than two years, and just shy of 70 percent had increased their responsibilities since starting their current job.</p>\n<p>Boorstin’s own résumé includes stints as director of public policy for Google, vice president at the think tank Center for American Progress, and seven years with the administration of President Bill Clinton—as chief speechwriter at the National Security Council and senior advisor to the Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of State. Before that he was a reporter for the <i>New York Times</i>.</p>\n<p>Boorstin was candid about his illness when he joined the Clinton campaign in 1992.</p>\n\n<div class=\"object-center\">\t\t\n\n    \n                <div class=\"imagecenter\">\n    \n    \n                                                                                                                                    <a href=https://ad.doubleclick.net/ddm/clk/303209565;130320553;q?http://www.bipolardepressionoptions.com?utm_medium=Display&amp;utm_source=Display&amp;utm_campaign=Latuda_DTC_Unbranded_Static&amp;utm_term=Display&amp;utm_content=LAT_LAT630-14&amp;http://www.latuda.com target=\"_self\">        <img src=\"/var/site_5441/storage/images/media2/images/advertisement11/35380-1-eng-GB/advertisement.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"297\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"advertisement\" title=\"advertisement\" />\n        </a>\t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n            </div>\n    \n    </div><p>“The person who brought me on, George Stephanopoulos, had been a friend from my Dukakis days and was fully aware of my condition from the start,” he told <i>bp</i>.</p>\n<p>However, he acknowledged that there’s no one-size-fits-all time to open up about bipolar disorder or another mental health issue in the workplace.</p>\n<p>“I would never tell anyone to disclose their mental illness unless they are very comfortable,” he says.</p>\n<p>He also advises against revealing a diagnosis during job interviews, noting that it’s illegal for employers to ask.</p>\n<p>“I don’t believe you should do it before you are hired, ever, because it shapes their thinking and you don’t want to be seen as a risk. The last thing any business wants is uncertainty.”</p>\n<p>Jeffrey Borenstein, MD, president and CEO of the Brain &amp; Behavior Research Foundation and host of the public television series <i>Healthy Minds with Dr. Jeffrey Borenstein</i>, agreed that there is no right or wrong time to disclose mental illness at work.</p>\n<p>“This is a very individualized decision that depends upon the type of work a person does, where they are professionally, their relations with superiors and peers, and where they are clinically,” Borenstein said.</p>\n<p>In Boorstin’s view, however, there are benefits to disclosure that help offset any risks.</p>\n<p>“After you get the job, tell your boss and a colleague so … when things go south, people are prepared. The worst thing you can do is to catch people by surprise,” he said.</p>\n<p>With your diagnosis out in the open, he added, co-workers have a context if you can’t come to work because of depressive fatigue or extreme irritability.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><b>SCHEDULING FOR STRESS</b></h3><p>Boorstin would agree that staying balanced in the face of a stressful job can be a challenge. In the Boston study, participants reported a range of on-the-job coping mechanisms, including taking breaks and using flex time.</p>\n<p>In many of his jobs, Boorstin has been able to set his own schedule.</p>\n<p>“If I am not up for going into work, I don’t go and then I work at night. I can do a meeting on the phone if I have to,” he said. “Flexible hours reduce stress.”</p>\n<p>Even if he works late, though, he makes sure to get to bed between 11:30 p.m. and midnight.</p>\n<p>“I used to be a 2 a.m. guy and that is disastrous. You are asking to be irritable,” he noted.</p>\n<p>His exercise routine also helps.</p>\n<p>“I use a treadmill every day before I go to work. It wakes me up, gets my mind working, and gets the synapses firing.”</p>\n<p>As Boorstin has discovered, consistent routine is an essential element in managing bipolar. Paid employment creates a ready-made structure, but he believes signing up for volunteer work with consistent hours can accomplish the same goal—and maybe more.</p>\n<p>“The worst thing is not having a schedule … and a volunteer job could also lead to a real one,” he pointed out.</p>\n<p>Boorstin is also a passionate fan of giving back.</p>\n<p>“I can honestly say the most fulfilling moments in my life have come when I help people like me who have mental illness,” he said.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><b>A LUCKY MAN</b></h3><p>Boorstin has a love-hate relationship with the meds that keep him stable. In his opinion, “even the best drugs suck”—but he’s well aware of the consequences of noncompliance.</p>\n<p>“If you get off of them and are really unlucky, you will wind up in the hospital, and if you are just unlucky, you will have terrible mood swings that kill productivity and ruin relationships,” he said.</p>\n<p>Thinking of his family helps him stay on the path: “If I go off my medications, it’s a direct threat to my children and a threat to their education and food on the table. I also keep my mom in mind.”</p>\n<p>Boorstin’s loved ones are his lookouts. They will tell him or his therapist if he starts to exhibit signs of hypomania such as glibness, frivolous spending, or going into overdrive with his writing.</p>\n<p>“My family has stuck with me through tremendous embarrassment. They have come to the mental hospital to see me, and put me ‘on the couch’ when I am down, and said things when they think I am rising,” he said. “I am lucky in that I have people who care.</p>\n<p>“Nobody has been as lucky as me.”</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>*  *  *  *  *</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<div>\n<table bgcolor=\"#eeeeee\">\n<tr>\n    <td>\n    <h2><b>What to fight for</b></h2><p><b>Advocating for better mental health care</b> can help make a difference for all individuals affected by chronic brain-based disorders—and everyone can do something, says Robert O. Boorstin.</p>\n<p>“Let’s tell the stories of the military and veterans whose experiences in war have left them marked by trauma. We need more money, nurses, psychologists and social workers to care for our veterans.”</p>\n<p><i>bp Magazine</i> caught up with Boorstin at the Brain &amp; Behavior Research Foundation’s annual symposium in New York City.</p>\n<p>After nearly 30 years of working in public policy circles, Boorstin has a few ideas about how to improve society’s approach to people with brain-based disorders.</p>\n<p>He’s emphatic that expanding mental health services is only part of the equation. A comprehensive solution would require criminal justice reform, as well as a ban on automatic weapons to help prevent lone-shooter tragedies.</p>\n<p>“In the 21st century, it’s easier to get an automatic weapon than it is to get treatment for mental health,” he said.</p>\n<p>Advocates have been more successful with legislation that mandates insurance coverage for behavioral health conditions on par with medical conditions—though work remains to be done in that area.</p>\n<p>According to Jeffrey Borenstein, MD, president and CEO of the Brain &amp; Behavior Research Foundation, federal parity laws haven’t been enforced as fully as they should be.</p>\n<p>“Speak up if you feel that your care is not similar to how it would be if you had another type of medical problem,” Borenstein said.</p>\n<p>That might involve reaching out to insurers and to elected officials at all levels of government.</p>\n<p>Maintaining equal coverage for behavioral health conditions helps lower financial barriers to getting needed treatment. Individuals who are able to go public with their own challenges and successes chip away at other kinds of barriers, Borenstein noted.</p>\n<p>“There still is a stigma toward people with bipolar disorder and other psychological conditions, but it is improving,” he said. “People like Bob Boorstin and others who speak out about their conditions show us that with proper treatment and support of family and friends, people can lead full, healthy, productive lives.”</p>\n\n    </td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n</div><p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<i>-----</i><br /><i>Denise Mann, MS, is a freelance writer in New York City.

When one of the residents was worried that her husband was stuck at home alone, Dale patiently promised to check on his wellbeing—although she knew the woman was a widow.</p>\n<p>It wasn’t training or work experience that gave Dale the empathy to calm the woman and get her engaged in the weekly bingo game. Instead, Dale credits her own journey with bipolar disorder.</p>\n<p>“I understood her because I know how altered realities can be believable in a psychotic frame of mind,” says Dale, who is 29. “I also feel like I ‘get’ them because my brain felt scrambled a lot in manic psychosis and on minimum sleep.”</p>\n<p>Dale was diagnosed with bipolar I at age 16 after being hospitalized during a manic episode. She spent her 20s learning to manage her brain-based chronic illness at a time when she was still figuring out a lot about who she was and experimenting with how to establish herself as an adult.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><b>CAREER PATH</b></h3><p>Stabilized with proper treatment, Dale attended a local community college for two years, then graduated from Roberts Wesleyan College in upstate New York with a bachelor’s degree in business administration. She recalls the campus environment as a safe place to practice finding and making the right kind of friends.</p>\n<p>While socializing could be a challenge, schoolwork came easy and Dale was able to keep up a high GPA throughout her studies.</p>\n<p>She soon found work as a graphic designer, but the deadline pressure was triggering for her bipolar symptoms. She ended up quitting as part of a larger effort to reduce stress in her life, leaving her jobless a few years out of college.</p>\n<p>She stumbled into her current career by happy accident. While deciding her next steps, she volunteered at a retirement community because she remembered how much she had loved giving musical performances at her grandfather’s nursing home.</p>\n<p>“I realized that working with seniors was something that I could do for a living. I was fulfilled and satisfied, and I felt like my work was not a job, but a joy,” says Dale.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><b>THE DATING GAME</b></h3><p>As with most young adults, dating and looking for true love was an important part of Dale’s 20s—complicated in her case by her bipolar illness.</p>\n<p>She tried one relationship in college with a boyfriend who had his own psychiatric diagnosis, believing they had the advantage of understanding each other’s challenges. Her mother thought the opposite, and in this case mother did know best: The relationship turned out to be tumultuous and short-lived.</p>\n<p>When Dale met the man who is now her husband, she was upfront about having bipolar early on. His reaction: Wanting to learn as much as possible about the condition. Like something out of a fairy tale, they got engaged after a quick courtship and were married 14 months after their first date.</p>\n<p>Dale says that meeting and marrying such a supportive man was life-changing.</p>\n<p>“He is very in tune to my moods and can tell when something is off with me, sometimes before I know. He helps make sure that I am taking my medicine and keep my doctor and therapist appointments. Most importantly, he is always there for me and always ready to listen,” she says.</p>\n<p>Her husband’s knowledge and understanding helped them weather an episode of mania and psychosis that led to her second hospitalization. At that point, they’d been married three years. Dale insisted she wanted a divorce. Luckily, he recognized that as a symptom of the mania, not something she really wanted.</p>\n<p>“When I’m stable I would never talk about divorcing my husband. Chris was so patient with me and loving. It hurt him, but he stood by my side and endured this time,” Dale says.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><b>MANAGING MEDICATION</b></h3><p>It’s said that experience is the best teacher, and Dale is not alone in learning the hard way that an effective medication regimen is the bedrock of wellness. The manic episode that threatened her marriage was the direct result of quitting her meds.</p>\n<p>At that point, Dale had been stable for some years. She was 24, she believed she was cured, and she decided she didn’t need her medication anymore.</p>\n<p>When Dale discussed the idea with her doctor, he talked about lowering her dosage. She convinced herself that the doctor said she could taper off entirely.</p>\n<p>“Nobody, no matter how close to me—even my husband or brother—could reason with me to stay on my medication,” she recalls. “I just don’t know if there are magic words to convince someone to stay on their medicine when they are in that state of mind.”</p>\n<p>Spending two months in and out of psychiatric facilities was plenty persuasive.</p>\n<p>“I’m now back to living a full life, because I take my medicine every day and have no plans to stop again,” she says.</p>\n<p>In addition to accepting the need for medication compliance, Dale focused on reducing her stress, seeing a therapist, and going for a run almost every day. She also credits her faith as her anchor and a large part of why she is stable.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><b>SELF-EXPLORATION</b></h3><p>Expressing her feelings through writing has been another anchor for Dale. She began journaling about her experiences with bipolar when she was 19. She even announced to a doctor during her first hospitalization as a teenager that she would write a memoir, which she is currently finishing up.</p>\n<p>She also started a blog in 2014 called Bipolar Brave that combines her own impressions, guest posts, and interviews with experts. She often explores topics that she herself wants to learn more about, such as what to consider if she and her husband choose to start a family.</p>\n<p>“It’s a labor of love because there is so much that I still can’t understand. I know someone out there is either going through the same thing or wants to better understand someone they love.</p>\n<p>“When someone around you is struggling with bipolar, you have no idea what is going on in their mind,” she adds. “It’s my way of telling my loved ones my side of the story.”</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<div>\n<table bgcolor=\"#eeeeee\">\n<tr>\n    <td>\n    <h2><b>Katie's Tips</b></h2><p><b>Here’s a short list of what helps Katie Dale deal with stress and stay in balance:</b></p>\n<p><b>RUNNING:</b> Ever since high school, I’ve tried to run as much as possible, even when I was sick. It’s a way to keep healthy—not just your mind but [also] your body. My mom always said, “Behavior change produces feeling change,” so when I’m in a slump I go out and run. I firmly believe that the physical, mental, emotional and spiritual all tie together.</p>\n<p><b>ROUTINE:</b> I get up every morning and have my coffee. I get something to eat and take my medicine with some water. Even when I’m depressed or manic, I always drink my coffee, so having a routine helps me always remember to take my medicine.</p>\n<p><b>PRAYER:</b> I keep close to God and pray and read His word. I need someone who would listen to my anxieties and be a shoulder to cry on. God brings me peace, and delighting in Him brings me my heart’s desires. He’s there when no one else is.</p>\n\n    </td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n</div><p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<i>-----</i><br /><i>Jennifer Goforth Gregory is a freelance writer in Raleigh, North Carolina.

After nearly 20 years in international development and consulting, she founded and runs The Stability Network, recruiting professionals to share their stories of living with brain-based disorders. She is also executive director of the Many Minds Collaborative in Seattle and mother to a preschooler.</b></p>\n<h4><b>How do you manage work-life balance?</b></h4><p>I have a very focused, structured workday. I work 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. and never any later, and never on weekends. After 5 p.m. I turn off my phone. I spend 20 minutes every morning reflecting on making my work day manageable. Every week, I plan with my therapist—we boot up the computer, we review my calendar for the week, and we triage.</p>\n<h4><b>How about your husband’s role?</b></h4><p>He travels about 30 percent of the time, so I’m a single mom a lot, but in terms of managing my bipolar illness he’s a huge partner. I told him I had bipolar disorder on our first date—“Go out and research it and see if you want a second date.” When I was hospitalized a few weeks after our wedding [in 2005], he became very involved in researching medication and strategies to stay well.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4><b>So what strategies work for you?</b></h4><p>I exercise daily. I go to bed at 8:45 p.m. to get nine hours of sleep a night. I meditate every morning for 10 minutes. I added the meditation about a year ago, and reflection on my workday about six months ago. It’s a work-in-progress.</p>\n<h4><b>What’s hardest about staying well in a demanding job?</b></h4><p>Interpersonal stress—managing complex relationships in a work setting—is the most challenging thing for me.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4><b>What helps the most with that?</b></h4><p>Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT). I apply it every single day. Every night I track what skills I used, all my emotions, in a spread sheet. Mindfulness, interpersonal effectiveness, distress tolerance—all the modules of DBT have changed my life.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4><b>Speaking of interpersonal stress, how about parenting?</b></h4><p>I don’t find my son triggering. For some reason being a mom has been a natural role for me. Not that I don’t get frustrated, but he doesn’t trigger my psychosis.</p>\n<h4><b>How do you keep working during depressive periods?</b></h4><p>I keep trying to do the next thing. I just say, “I’ve got to brush my teeth.” Then I say, “I’ve got to take a shower.” The alternative is lying in bed feeling awful and that’s worse for me than just trying to get through the day. I also try to do something nice to improve the situation—call a friend, sit by a pretty view. I validate my emotions: “I’m feeling depressed. It’s not my fault, it’s OK to take a breath or take a break.”</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4><b>After your diagnosis, what helped you feel you could still succeed in your goals?</b></h4><p>I asked the doctors at the hospital, “Can I get back to school, can I go on to a demanding corporate career?” They said, “We don’t know. It can go either way.” My mom brought me Kay Jamison’s <i>An Unquiet Mind</i>. I showed it to the social worker and said, “I don’t know how this woman did it, but I’m going to do it, too.”</p>\n<h4><b>So you’re returning the favor with The Stability Network?</b></h4><p>I realized people like me had to speak out, and if we organized a lot of people to speak up that would be even more powerful.
