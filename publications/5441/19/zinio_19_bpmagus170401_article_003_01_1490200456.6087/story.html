<p><b>BE BOLD.</b> That’s my slogan here at <i>bp Magazine</i>. Over the last few years I’ve written and rewritten it on our white board. It stares me in the face every hour of every day and pushes me to get the job done. Get the message out. No excuses.</p>
<p>So far, so good, but here’s the thing: combine that with an entrepreneur’s “trust your gut” instincts and you’ve got risky business. Same thing when mania or hypomania roll in and the usual filters come off.</p>
<p>Yes, we can achieve a lot, enjoy a lot, when we’re not held back by indecision, but watch out—the reverse is true, too. The results of impulsive decision-making can be devastating. “Impulse Power” shows how to build in fail-safes to help us pause and ponder whether it’s a good idea to “just go for it.”</p>
<p>Part of our mission at <i>bp Magazine</i> has always been to connect you with “been there, done that” guidance from others who really know what you’re going through. For “Profiles in Parenting,” writer Stephanie Stephens interviewed three families who share their wisdom of experience—along with real-life proof that it’s possible to advocate for and navigate a child with bipolar through their adolescent years.</p>
<p>There’s no doubt that getting enough physical activity is key to wellness, but there’s also no denying there are plenty of roadblocks to maintaining an exercise routine. Not enough time, not enough energy, no interest … those are just some of the all-too-human exercise excuses we address in “Action Plan.” One tip: Thinking about the immediate mood boost that comes from going for a walk or working out reinforces intrinsic motivation, which is our inner inclination to do something.</p>
<p>And keep this advice from personal trainer Kathleen Trotter in mind: “Perfect is the enemy of done, so stop trying to find the ‘perfect’ way to work out … do what you can.” That’s good to remember whether we’re trying to move more or chasing stability.</p>
