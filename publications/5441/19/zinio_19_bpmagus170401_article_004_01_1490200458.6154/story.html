<h3>AN ORCHESTRA FOR US</h3><p>
I LOVE READING articles about people who have bipolar disorder but who are still successful in their chosen fields. The journey to success is always the best part and helps me connect to them. “The Maestro &amp; Me2/” (Winter 2017) is by far my favorite, though. Not only is Ronald Braunstein extremely successful in his craft, but he has altered and molded his career into something that includes others living in similar situations. To me this seems like the best kind of advocacy. I’ll be watching the orchestra’s website to see if they ever come out my way!<br /><b>—L.E.</b> ST. LOUIS, MO</p>

AWESOME! I’VE ALWAYS WANTED somewhere I could work and just be with people like me.<br /><b>—F.J.G.</b> via facebook</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
I AM SO GLAD Maestro Braunstein can still work and help people with mental disorders feel good about themselves. He is a true advocate for bipolar and I am so proud of him and all he has accomplished despite his diagnosis. He is not afraid to speak out about his illness and helps so many people. He is a true inspiration and his wife is his caring support system.<br /><b>—Marca</b> via bphope.com</p>

THIS IS FANTASTIC. I am also a musician with bipolar disorder: opera singer and choir director.<br /><b>—E.H.</b> via facebook</p>

    </div><h3>INSIGHT INTO MANIA</h3><p>
I THINK THE ARTICLE ON MANIA (“Getting a Grip on Mania,” Winter 2017) is a very good overview of the manic side of bipolar disorder. In reading and researching so much in order to help our daughter, I have come to the conclusion that my daughter’s husband was her trigger for mania. She was the breadwinner and homeowner before their marriage and spent extravagantly on him. He was the beneficiary of her manic episodes and took advantage of her. I wonder how many people with bipolar find themselves in this position. We will get her through this with the help of a great team.<br /><b>—Name Withheld</b></p>

<p>
I AM SO GLAD that I subscribe to your magazine. There is so much useful information for me. I have been diagnosed with bipolar I. Right now I am going through a bad state of mania. I can’t sleep, I’m spending like crazy, and have energy to burn, I can’t sit still for 5 minutes. Hopefully this article will help me cope.<br /><b>—Irene Weiler,</b> KITCHENER, ON</p>

<h3>CREATIVE DEBATE</h3><p>
THANK YOU SO MUCH for the On My Mind article about medications not taking away one’s creativity (“Medication and Inspiration,” Winter 2017). That is an argument I hear all the time, most specifically from my daughter’s boyfriend who thinks that he needs to suffer (be unhappy) to be an artist.<br /><b>—C.G.,</b> ASHBURN, VA</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
I AM A PROFESSIONAL COMPOSER and published poet—with a seriously bipolar mind. I was immensely scared to lose my creativity when I got diagnosed, which is now eight years ago. The contrary happened: my works are more mature, and still exuberant, complex and layered.<br /><b>—Mitch</b> via bphope.com</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
I DO AGREE [about controlling mania with medication in order to produce lasting artistic works], unless the medication makes you overly sedated. Currently I’m on a cocktail that doesn’t sedate me that much and allows me to think clearly. Yes, thinking clearly is not possible when I am manic or often even moderately hypomanic. Yes, when I’m manic I think what I produce is superior, but you make a great point that when the mania clears, you realize it’s not so much. A lot of what I say or write when in elevated states is disjointed or even nonsensical. Being stable allows a much higher percentage of my life to be creative.<br /><b>—Forsythia</b> via bphope.com</p>

<p>
FOR ME SO FAR all the meds I’ve been on have masked my creativity.<br /><b>—Bobbi Lee</b> via bphope.com</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>‘GETTING IT’</h3><p>
I HAVEN’T READ AN ARTICLE on bipolar as eloquent and truthful as your piece (“What I Wish Family and Friends Knew,” Winter 2017). I am 50 and was diagnosed at age 17. My family refused to believe I had a mental illness. My own mother thought I was “lazy and stupid,” which I am not. After my fifth hospitalization they decided that the medical doctors were probably right.<br /><b>—Nicole</b> via bphope.com</p>

<p>
THANK YOU FOR this article. It helps to know I’m not alone.<br /><b>—Hans</b> via bphope.com</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
After reading <b>“WHAT I WISH MY FAMILY AND FRIENDS KNEW,”</b> I cried my eyes out. It’s so refreshing to see someone put into words how I feel daily. It seems as if most people don’t view bipolar as a real illness although we battle with it daily. We didn’t ask for this. It’s just the cards we were dealt. I struggle with relationships and wonder if I will ever find someone who can accept me and this illness and love, learn, and deal with all that comes along with it.<br /><b><i>—</i>Coco </b>via bphope.com</p>

<h3>NEW PERSPECTIVES</h3><p>
JUST HAD AN “AHA!” MOMENT reading Julie Fast’s column “Unexpected Signs of Depression” (Winter 2017). I experience varying degrees of all three of these signs [irritability, restlessness, inability to feel loving]. “Can’t feel love” struck a cord and it makes sense to me now where this comes from. My husband, thankfully, is great at working through this with me and I’ve learned to seek help when I’m in a deep state of any one of these. Thank you for helping me to understand my illness better!<br /><b>—faithfilled2017</b> via bphope.com</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
I AM NEW TO the bpHope website and this article was the first thing that stuck out. I thought I was going crazy until I read it. I never thought of being irritable as a sign of my bipolar rearing its ugly head. Sometimes I can’t feel the love for myself after the irritability occurs. Thank you so much for the article!<br /><b>—Tonia</b> via bphope.com</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
THE IRRITATION YOU TALK ABOUT sounds just like me. I go off in a fraction of a second over absolutely nothing, and 15 minutes later I am fine. I need to talk to my psychiatrist about this. Thank you for the heads up.<br /><b>—Kelly</b> via bphope.com</p>

<h3>BOOK: 'NO MORE SECRETS'</h3><p>
I JUST FINISHED READING Mimi Baird’s book <i>He Wanted the Moon: The Madness and Medical Genius of Dr. Perry Baird, and His Daughter’s Quest to Know Him</i> (“Back Chat: Mimi Baird,” Winter 2017). This book made me feel so much, I cried at parts. I will never forget how this book validates bipolar disorder. I, too, want the moon and that gave me peace.<br /><b>—Kdean</b> via bphope.com</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
I READ THIS BOOK [by Mimi Baird] about a year ago. Though psychiatric care probably isn’t where it should be, nor is inpatient hospital care, I am forever grateful that I did not struggle with mental illness during the 1940s, ’50s, etc. The book was a real eye-opener!<br /><b>—Stacy</b> via bphope.com</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
THIS ISSUE OF passing down the story of the treatment of mental illness is of paramount importance because of the repercussions it has on the generations that follow. My dear mam was and still is very open about her father’s treatment when he was mentally ill in the 1950s and all five of us children have witnessed her psychotic periods, severe anxiety, paranoia, and deep depression—painful at a young age, and it affects each child in a different way. However, it has made us very knowledgeable as concerns the warning signs and treatment of mental illness. I do not shy away from behavior which others may find very upsetting because I understand so much more about it.<br /><b>—Jen</b> via bphope.com</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
I MUST GET THIS BOOK! But I’m skeptical about the Hollywood adaptation [of <i>He Wanted the Moon</i>], as that industry hasn’t exactly shown any regard for truth or scientifically accurate representation of mental illness, especially bipolar disorder. But I’ll keep fingers crossed.<br /><b>—D.A.B.</b> via facebook</p>

<h3>STRENGTH &amp; HOPE</h3><p>
YOUR MAGAZINE HAS BEEN so informational to me and my husband. My daughter has bipolar II and it helped us understand the diagnosis better which, in turn, helps us understand our daughter’s mood episodes. She is on meds, in therapy, and raising a family. We are (at least try to be) supportive any way we can.<br /><b>—Name Withheld,</b> STILWELL, KS</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
I THINK YOU HAVE an excellent [online] support forum. It allows people to be upfront and it eases the pain and shame until one is ready to open up in front of a person. I don’t have to explain my feelings over and over because people understand from their experiences. I get help just from reading others’ posts.<br /><b>—Name Withheld</b> CHICAGO, IL</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
I CANNOT EXPLAIN how the quality of my life has improved since finding <i>bp Magazine</i>. As with many of us with bipolar, I have been stigmatized by a number of family members who will not discuss my bipolar. I have found wonderful professional treatment and educators, but nothing can compare with reading a story from a fellow individual with bipolar who is willing to share their experience, strength and hope. I can read these articles without fear of rejection, giving me the freedom to say, “Yeah, me too.”<br /><b>—Linda</b> via bphope.com</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
I WAS REALLY AMAZED to see that there is a separate magazine published for people with bipolar disorder. It gave me immense pleasure and satisfaction to know about the latest news and views regarding bipolar. I had undiagnosed bipolar for years, with feelings of suicide, hopelessness, etc., blaming myself and not knowing where to find the solution. Finally I got a correct diagnosis in 2011. I have been on several prescriptions and by now, I know which medication suits me or not. I even had a successful pregnancy and delivered a healthy boy. I just wanted to say to all my friends out there who have bipolar, that there is hope always and never give up on yourself.<br /><b>—Name Withheld,</b> HYDERABAD, INDIA</p>
