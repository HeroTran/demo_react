<p><b>FAVORITE BOOK: </b><i>A Clockwork Orange</i>, by Anthony Burgess. I used to be a punk rocker and that antiestablishment ethos will always remain with me (though not to the violent extent of the book).</p>
<p><b>FAVORITE FOOD:</b> Lasagna. I make a killer five-cheese version with all fresh ingredients and herbs. The goat cheese really makes it sing.</p>
<p><b>TO DESTRESS I:</b> Listen to music. I calm my nerves and slow my racing thoughts with albums like Air’s <i>Moon Safari</i> and Joni Mitchell’s <i>Blue</i> and playlists of Beethoven, Bach, Mozart, and Tchaikovsky.</p>
<p><b>MOST TREASURED ITEM:</b> My 1994 Fender Stratocaster guitar. I got it when I was 14. It’s got that ’90s grunge sound everyone covets now.</p>
<p><b>IT MIGHT SURPRISE YOU TO KNOW:</b> I spent many summers at tennis camp growing up. I abhor sports, but I do play tennis.</p>
<p><b>I WISH I WERE BETTER AT:</b> Public speaking. I’m terrified of it. I just need to practice.</p>
<p><b>BIGGEST ADVENTURE SO FAR:</b> I went to Bali several years ago. A highlight was attending a Balinese funeral, an upbeat celebration that parades through the streets.</p>
<p><b>BEST RESOURCE:</b> My dad. He was a stay-at-home dad in the ’80s—avant-garde for the time—and I’ve learned so much from him. He is a wellspring of advice.</p>
<p><b>BIGGEST CHALLENGE I’VE OVERCOME:</b> Emerging from a deep depression in 2008. I was crying every day for a year and constantly asking for hugs from friends and family. Finally my doctor and I found the right medications to stabilize me.</p>
<p><b>PROUDEST ACHIEVEMENT:</b> When I was a producer for MTV News, I orchestrated a three-part series about the future of the music industry.</p>
<p><b>GREATEST LESSON I’VE LEARNED:</b> Don’t be afraid to be different.</p>
