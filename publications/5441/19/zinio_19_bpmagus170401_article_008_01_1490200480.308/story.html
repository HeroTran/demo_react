<h3>Nevada governor proposes steep cuts</h3><p>March 3, 2017, RENO, NV—Gov. Brian Sandoval’s proposal to cut $20 million in state-provided mental health services has met with opposition from some lawmakers as well as mental health advocates, social workers, judges, and police officers who said there is already a severe lack of services.</p>
<p>Sandoval has argued that his decision to expand Medicaid coverage means more individuals who need help will get it through that insurance program, which is largely funded by the federal government. State Assemblyman Mike Sprinkle pointed to a lack of data on whether patients dropped by state agencies are receiving care elsewhere.</p>
<p>Cuts in Reno have affected outpatient medication clinics, outpatient counseling services, and the rapid stabilization unit at the state’s psychiatric hospital.</p>
<p>According to the <i>Reno Gazette-Journal</i>, emergency rooms have seen a spike in individuals in need of psychiatric care and a significant increase in the number of petitions for civil commitment to a psychiatric hospital. A mobile outreach team found in two-thirds of encounters, the individual was receiving no mental health care.</p>

<h3>North Carolina schools object to cost of recommended mental health reforms</h3><p>MARCH 1, 2017, RALEIGH, NC—State education leaders are working to revise a proposed mental health policy for public schools that generated opposition from stakeholders, WRAL-TV reports.</p>

<p>Local school boards and charter schools said some of the guidelines were burdensome and expensive to implement.</p>
<p>Amanda Bell, a school board member in Rockingham County who is an advisor to the state board of education, said the proposed policy is an “admirable effort” but that many schools have had to eliminate school nurses and share social workers due to bare-bones budgets.</p>
