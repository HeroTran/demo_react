<h3><b>Cognitive impairment tied to weight gain</b></h3><p>March 1, 2017, VANCOUVER, BC—Lower functioning on various domains of cognitive performance has been linked with increasing weight in both people with bipolar disorder and people without the disorder.</p>
<p>Canadian and Brazilian researchers noted that elevated body mass index (BMI) has been linked with lower cognitive functioning in bipolar disorder. They followed teens and adults with bipolar over a 12-month period and compared them with a matched group from the general population.</p>
<p>Having lower baseline scores in cognitive domains such as attention, verbal memory, and working memory predicted increasing body mass index for both groups. Neither baseline BMI nor increasing BMI predicted lower cognitive function.</p>
<p>The researchers said targeting patients’ cognition may be important for minimizing weight gain in bipolar disorder.</p>
<p>The study, which appeared in the journal <i>Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica</i>, was entitled “Lower cognitive functioning as a predictor of weight gain in bipolar disorder: A 12-month study.”</p>

<h3>ACT therapy good for bipolar with anxiety</h3><p> March 1, 2017, STOCKHOLM, Sweden —Acceptance and commitment therapy appears beneficial for people with bipolar disorder who have co-existing anxiety, a small pilot study suggests.</p>
<p>Acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) involves psychological interventions that encourage mindfulness, learning to accept painful thoughts and feelings as they are, and working around them to pursue new behaviors.</p>
<p>Swedish researchers, noting co-existing bipolar and anxiety often means a poorer treatment outcome, had people with bipolar types I or II take part in 12 sessions of group ACT. After treatment, participants reported significant improvements in anxiety or depressive symptoms, quality of life, psychological flexibility, and other areas.</p>
<p>The study, which appeared in the journal <i>Cognitive Behaviour Therapy</i>, was entitled “Group acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) for bipolar disorder and co-existing anxiety—an open pilot study.”</p>

<h3>Collaborative care helps diabetes outcomes</h3><p>February 1, 2017, SEATTLE, WA—Integrating behavioral health care and medical care appears to improve type 2 diabetes in people with bipolar disorder and other psychiatric conditions, a new study suggests.</p>
<p>American researchers looked at 600 individuals being treated at a “safety net” primary care clinic, meaning it serves many low-income individuals. Around 151 patients with higher levels of hemoglobin A1c—an indicator of high blood glucose levels—were referred to a collaborative care team.</p>
<p> Rates of mood and anxiety disorders were higher in this group than among patients who were not referred.</p>
<p>During the 18-month study, the group treated by the collaborative care team had significantly greater reductions in hemoglobin A1c than those who received treatment as usual.</p>
<p>The study, which appeared in the journal <i>General Hospital Psychiatry</i>, was entitled “A collaborative care team to integrate behavioral health care and treatment of poorly-controlled type 2 diabetes in an urban safety net primary care clinic.”</p>

<h3>Predictors of substance use in youth with high levels of manic behavior</h3><p>February 1, 2017, NEW YORK, NY—A new study highlights possible risk factors for regular use of alcohol or drugs in young people prone to mania.</p>
<p>American researchers screened children between ages 6 and 13 at child outpatient mental health clinics to identify those who scored high on an assessment tool that measures manic behaviors. Youth in the study were assessed every six months over six years.</p>
<p>The researchers found that a baseline diagnosis of disruptive behavior disorder, stressful life events, a high manic symptom burden in the first two years of follow-up, and family environment were predictors for regular use of substances. Being treated with medication decreased the risk of regular drug use.</p>
<p>The study, which appeared in the <i>Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry</i>, was entitled “Development of alcohol and drug use in youth with manic symptoms.”</p>

<h3>Polarity of first episode affects other factors</h3><p>February 1, 2017, MILAN, Italy—People with bipolar disorder whose first episode was a depressive state are at higher risk of suicide, a new study suggests.</p>
<p>Italian and American researchers, noting that polarity at onset of bipolar has been increasingly studied in recent years, looked at 362 bipolar patients in recovery. Their analysis found that those with depressive onset had a rate of suicide attempts more than double that of people whose initial onset was manic, hypomanic, or mixed.</p>
<p>Depressive onset was also associated with significantly higher rates of bipolar II diagnosis, lifetime stressful events, current psychiatric medicine use, and longer duration of most recent mood episode.</p>
<p>However, this group had lower rates of psychosis and involuntary commitments. They were also more likely to be married and employed than the group with elevated onset.</p>
<p>The study, which appeared in the <i>Journal of Affective Disorders</i>, was entitled “Onset polarity in bipolar disorder: A strong association between first depressive episode and suicide attempts.”</p>

<h3>Bipolar treatment should address cardio fitness</h3><p>February 1, 2017, LEUVEN, Belgium—People with bipolar disorder and other serious brain-based disorders have significantly lower cardiorespiratory fitness than people with no psychiatric diagnosis, but targeted supervision and exercise can improve those fitness levels, a new study suggests.</p>
<p>Belgian, Brazilian, Australian and British researchers conducted an analysis of previous studies involving fitness levels of people with serious psychiatric disorders. Although fitness levels in this population were significantly lower overall in comparison to control groups, the researchers also found that high-intensity interventions (exercise at least three times per week and supervision by specialists such as physiotherapists and exercise psychologists) were associated with improved cardiorespiratory fitness.</p>
<p>Noting that poor cardiorespiratory fitness is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease and premature mortality, the study authors concluded that treatment plans should include a focus on improving fitness.</p>
<p>The study, which appeared in the journal <i>Sports Medicine</i>, was entitled “Cardiorespiratory fitness in severe mental illness: A systematic review and meta-analysis.”</p>

<h3>Impact of psychosocial history on suicide risk</h3><p>January 25, 2017, TOLEDO, OH—A new study sheds light on risk factors associated with suicide among young adults with bipolar disorder.</p>
<p>American researchers studied the records of individuals with bipolar who were treated at a university outpatient psychiatric clinic and found that 41 percent had attempted suicide.</p>
<p>The researchers said that asking about previous suicide attempts is the most accurate way to predict future suicidal behavior, but that a younger age at onset of illness, past trauma, a history of alcohol abuse, and psychotic symptoms were also strongly associated with suicidality.</p>
<p>They recommended an increased emphasis on psychosocial history and comorbid symptoms in treating patients with bipolar disorder.</p>
<p>The study, which appeared in the journal <i>Psychopathology</i> online ahead of print, was entitled “Psychosocial factors and comorbidity associated with suicide attempts: Findings in patients with bipolar disorder.”</p>

    </div><h3>Common parasite may be a trigger for bipolar disorder</h3><p>February 1, 2017, BELO HORIZONTE, Brazil—Existing evidence supports the idea that early infection with the single-celled parasite Toxoplasma gondii increases the risk of developing bipolar disorder, according to a new study.</p>
<p>Brazilian and American researchers conducted an analysis of previous studies looking at possible links between bipolar and T. gondii, which is found in cat feces. Noting limitations like small sample size, they concluded that infection with T. gondii appears to be clinically relevant in bipolar. However, they said there was not enough information to determine how infection with T. gondii relates to symptoms and severity of bipolar.</p>
<p>They also found people with bipolar were more likely to be infected than comparison groups without bipolar. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, roughly a fourth of American adults have been infected with T. gondii, though few show symptoms.</p>
<p>The study, which appeared in the <i>Journal of Affective Disorders</i>, was entitled “Is there any association between Toxoplasma gondii infection and bipolar disorder? A systematic review and meta-analysis.”</p>

    </div><h3>Changes within the hippocampus seen in people with bipolar</h3><p>January 24, 2017, HOUSTON, TX—A new study has pinpointed areas within the hippocampus that are smaller in people with bipolar disorder, especially those with bipolar I.</p>
<p>American researchers said their study is one of the first to locate specific subfields linked to bipolar within the hippo-campus, which is a seahorse-shaped area of the brain identified as a processing hub for mood and memory.</p>
<p>Compared to people with major depressive disorder and people with no psychiatric diagnosis, people with bipolar had reduced volumes in subfield 4 of the cornu ammonis (CA), two cellular layers, and the tail portion of the hippocampus.</p>
<p>The researchers also found that volumes decreased with longer illness duration and number of manic episodes.</p>
<p>The study, which appeared in the journal <i>Molecular Psychiatry</i> online ahead of print, was entitled “Hippocampal subfield volumes in mood disorders.”</p>

    </div><h3>Sleep patterns linked with cognitive deficits</h3><p>January 5, 2017, BERKELEY, CA—Overall amount of sleep and a variable sleep schedule appear to be connected to cognitive deficits in people with bipolar disorder, according to a new study.</p>
<p>American researchers noted that sleep disturbance and cognitive dysfunction are often present even between bipolar mood episodes. They looked at two cognitive categories before and after treatment for insomnia: verbal learning and working memory, which involves reasoning, decision-making, and processing information.</p>
<p>The researchers found that improved consistency in sleep time predicted improved verbal learning and more total sleep time predicted improved working memory. They said their findings highlight the importance of treating sleep disturbance in bipolar.</p>
<p>The study, which appeared in the <i>Journal of Psychiatric Research</i> online ahead of print, was entitled “The association between insomnia related sleep disruptions and cognitive dysfunction during the inter-episode phase of bipolar disorder.”</p>

<h3>History of bipolar increases likelihood of developing dementia later in life</h3><p>January 4, 2017, HOUSTON, TX—People with a history of bipolar disorder appear to be at significant risk for dementia as older adults, a new literature review has confirmed.</p>
<p>American researchers did a meta-analysis of six studies involving 3,026 individuals with bipolar disorder and 191,029 individuals without bipolar. While their results indicate there is a link between bipolar and dementia, they said future studies should evaluate possible reasons for the association and evaluate possible interventions to reduce the risk of dementia in this population.</p>
<p>The study, which appeared in the <i>American Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry</i> online ahead of print, was entitled “History of bipolar disorder and the risk of dementia: A systematic review and meta-analysis.”</p>
<h3>Evidence does not support exclusion from organ transplant programs</h3><p>January 1, 2017, DUBLIN, Ireland—People with bipolar disorder should no longer be unfairly excluded from organ transplantation, a new study concludes.</p>
<p>Irish researchers said that people with serious psychiatric disorders have been excluded from organ transplantation programs in the past, despite the fact that there is little data to support exclusion based on a psychiatric diagnosis.</p>
<p> The researchers looked at people who received kidney transplants over a 28-year period to examine such things as patient survival, length of hospitalization, and organ rejection. They found no significant differences between people with a psychiatric disorder and people with no psychiatric diagnosis.</p>
<p>The authors concluded that while consideration of psychiatric conditions is an important part of pre-transplant assessment and selection, people with those disorders should not be discriminated against because there’s no evidence it negatively affects transplant outcomes.</p>
<p>The study, which appeared in the journal <i>Psychosomatics</i>, was entitled “Outcomes of renal transplantation in patients with bipolar affective disorder and schizophrenia: A national retrospective cohort study.”</p>
