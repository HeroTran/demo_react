<p>AFTER A COLOSSAL FIGHT with your honey, you head out for the night and end up getting too cozy with some random guy at the bar. Or your boss offers constructive criticism that you take to be more criticizing than constructive, so you say spiteful things about her to co-workers.</p>
<p>Everyone has impulsive tendencies at times. Who hasn’t acted on a whim without thinking it through or gotten carried away by an exciting idea?</p>
<p>In some situations, the ability to act boldly may be desirable—it’s what entrepreneurs rely on, after all. More often, it can result in troubling and even dangerous consequences, especially when it’s amplified by hypomania or mania.</p>
<p>Impulsivity and elevated mood go hand in hand. In fact, pursuing risky behaviors that have a high potential for negative outcomes is one of the symptoms used to diagnose hypo/mania. However, a body of research suggests that even in times of stability, lower impulse control is characteristic of adults with bipolar.</p>
<p>Based on emotion rather than logical reasoning, impulsivity is an urge to act without regard for the future. Whether it’s saying whatever comes into your head or deciding to move to Australia <i>right now</i>, the results can be devastating: fractured relationships, lost jobs, staggering debt, compromised health, legal troubles, and on and on.</p>
<p>Relatively minor behaviors associated with impulsivity—including impatience and interrupting when others speak—can alienate those around you. There’s also a link between weak impulse control and explosive anger.</p>
<p>Studies suggest that the part of the brain that plans and analyzes tends to have a weaker grip on emotional circuitry in people with bipolar—akin to worn brake pads that can’t stop a speeding car in time.</p>
<p>In addition, the reward system seems to be more sensitive, so that the lure of a prize wields more power. On the one hand, that hyperactivity can fuel goal-directed achievement; on the other, it increases susceptibility to addiction and intensifies cravings for excitement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>‘PAUSE AND PONDER’</h3><p>When dealing with bipolar, it’s always good to remember this motto: “Biology is not destiny.” That said, you may need stronger external circuit breakers to help you pause and ponder when your inner voice says “Go for it!”</p>
<p>Deby Spicuzza of Virginia has wrestled with pinpointing the difference between impulsivity and intuition.</p>
<p>“I’ve had to learn to identify which risks are smart and educated and thought-through, and which are the superficial result of hypomania,” says Spicuzza, who has bipolar II.</p>
<p>“Hypomania can make even the worst idea feel pretty special, but I’ve discovered that impulses can be one-trick ponies.… They often don’t have any substance beneath them.”</p>
<p>Spicuzza doesn’t want to entirely give up her reputation for being “wacky and quirky,” but she now prefers what she calls “the much less exciting, but far more grounded responsibility of commitment.”</p>

    </div><p>Impetuously chasing some perceived jackpot of the moment has caused Spicuzza problems. She recalls one incident that tested her relationship with a good friend who was her roommate at the time.</p>
<p>The other woman had just broken up with her boyfriend and Spicuzza intended to be there to provide comfort. On the way home, she found out that another friend’s band was playing at a local club. She figured she’d just peek in to say hi, but when she arrived someone in line offered her a ticket to the sold-out show. It seemed like kismet, so Spicuzza blew off her grieving girlfriend.</p>
<p>“I felt like I was supposed to be at this show, not keeping this pretty special commitment to my friend,” she explains.</p>
<p>Spicuzza realizes now that the situation “wasn’t this magical moment when the stars aligned so I could see this guy in this band. It was just me giving in to an impulsive act.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>ACCOUNTABILITY</h3><p>Impulsive behavior and unfiltered speech can leave a wake of hurt, angry and bewildered people. Then it’s time to deal with the guilt and regrets, while hoping that apologies and making amends will repair any rifts.</p>
<p>Andy L. who lives in the state of Washington, is working on recognizing how his behavior affects those around him. In the moment, it’s often a challenge to stop and consider whether his actions might be unwelcome.</p>
<p>“I don’t realize how inappropriate and uncomfortable I’m making the other person,” he says. “I’m so delighted not to care.”</p>
<p>During his last hypomanic episode, for example, he abruptly decided to give away some of his possessions to family members.</p>
<p>While they were out of the house, the musician set up his electronic drum set in his son’s room and gathered together a batch of his old recordings for his wife. Having read somewhere of an association between Buddhists and tangerines, he placed a fruit in each bedroom as a sign of gratitude.</p>
<p>Andy recalls: “My family was like, ‘Yeah, I don’t want this. Thanks.’ It was all very benign, but also irritating and nutty to them.”</p>
<p>Andy has learned not to keep his impulsive feelings to himself. He used to let them out only on a private notepad, which helped him sort out his thoughts but didn’t provide an outside perspective. Now he also turns to his wife, Kristin, a psychotherapist.</p>
<p>“I have a partner I can trust and who isn’t afraid of this,” he says. “It’s a good idea to have somebody who can check your reality…. I can say, ‘Am I being weird? Are you feeling uncomfortable?’”</p>
<p>It’s definitely helpful to have a person—whether a mental health professional or someone close whom you trust—who can steer you away from impetuous behavior.</p>
<p>Cognitive-behavioral skills and mindfulness practices can also be immensely useful in slowing down impulsive responses.</p>
<p>Stuart Moore, a licensed clinical social worker in Northern Virginia, guides clients in how to pause long enough to weigh the pros and cons of a particular impulse.</p>
<p>“That pause, that reflective moment, takes the [situation] away from impulsivity to a conscious decision,” he says. “That doesn’t mean we need to take it off the table, but maybe we can take it off the table for right now.”</p>
<p>Some people impose a mandatory waiting period on taking any action to see if it still seems like a good idea in a week, say. That sifts out the promising proposals from mere whims.</p>
<p>Says Moore, “At some point the impulse is no longer necessary. It’s moved on.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>FINDING FAIL-SAFES</h3><p> Melissa Calhoun describes herself as “a fly-by-the-seat-of-my-pants kind of person.” The Canadian woman, who has bipolar I, is apt to make decisions with little forethought—whether shopping on eBay when she’s depressed or hypomanic or making major life changes in times of stress.</p>
<p>“Predominantly I know it’s a bad thing [to do] but act on it anyway because I give myself excuses in my head,” she says of her impulsive tendencies. “And sometimes I don’t know it’s a bad idea and it’s an absolute loss of control.”</p>
<p>When Calhoun’s husband left their marriage, she responded—the next day—by starting to date a friend she had known for nearly a decade.</p>
<p>“He came over to make sure I was OK, and never left,” she recalls. “Should I have been dating yet? Probably not.”</p>
<p>Recognizing her behavior patterns lets her build in some fail-safes. Because she knows she’s prone to overspending, Calhoun hands her bank card over to her boyfriend when the two go out on the town. He also helped her develop a monthly budget intended to keep her finances stable.</p>
<p>Still, such measures aren’t foolproof. One Maryland man with bipolar I has trouble abiding by spending limits established by his wife.</p>
<p>Once when George took his teenage daughter to the mall, he spent upwards of $500 instead of the approved amount of $50, “buying clothes, and doing silly things like buying five appetizers before our meal came out,” he remembers. “I was just happy to see my daughter happy.”</p>
<p>In his case, removing temptation has yielded better results. George deactivated most of his social media accounts to cut down on the number of comments he posts without the proper mental filtering.</p>
<p>Those kind of posts frequently cause friction with his wife, which then prompts him to say “horrific things,” which then leaves him angry at himself, which then feeds back into spontaneous online vents.</p>
<p>“It’s a vicious cycle,” he says. “It’s definitely not worth the problems it causes, so now I just primarily use Twitter for news feeds until I get my stuff under control.”</p>
<p>Spicuzza carries a small charm with her as a reminder that when it comes to the allure of impulse, she has been down that path before. The charm is a unicorn; it came on a necklace she bought for a pricey-for-her $50. At the time, she felt there was something meaningful and poignant about it.</p>
<p>“Impulse will show you a lot of unicorns,” she reflects, “so keeping one with me is a reminder that impulse feels special and significant, but ultimately it’s [about] illusions.</p>
<p> When an impulsive urge stirs, Spicuzza turns to the charm for a mental prompt.</p>
<p>“I recognize this feeling,” she tells herself. “I’ve been here before. It’ll pass.”</p>

    <h3><b>CONTROL PANEL</b></h3><p><b>Developing strategies for dialing back impulsive urges will lead to more stability and healthier choices. Some ideas:</b></p>
<p><b>FIND A LIFEGUARD.</b> That’s what Elaina Bartlett, a Vancouver counselor with bipolar disorder, calls someone who can work collaboratively with you to develop a maintenance plan for day-to-day stability and wellness—and be upfront when red flags arise. Preparation is key: It is much easier to handle a crisis when there’s a plan in place to deal with one.</p>
<p><b>DETECT YOUR WEAK POINTS.</b> Only then can you plan for them. Think about when your urges are hardest to resist: Does a particular person bring out that side of you? Are there situations that make impulsive behaviors harder to resist? When do you find yourself regretting your behavior most often?</p>
<p><b>INSTALL BRAKING SYSTEMS.</b> “Just because it’s in the brain doesn’t mean it’s out of your control,” says Michael E. Thase, MD. “Even something as simple as counting to 10, under your breath, before you respond can have beneficial impact.” Other tips: Write a list of pros and cons before making a tough decision; conduct research on a potential purchase before getting your money involved; mentally rehearse what you want to say before you say it.</p>

    <h3><b>THOUGHT POLICE</b></h3><p>Assessment tools used to rate impulsivity sometimes laser down to distinct aspects such as <b>MOTOR IMPULSIVITY</b> (rash actions), <b>NONPLANNING IMPULSIVITY</b> (not taking the future into account), <b>TEMPORAL IMPULSIVITY</b> (the drive for immediate gratification), and <b>COGNITIVE IMPULSIVITY</b> (jumpy thinking). Cognitive impulsivity makes it harder to absorb new material, piece through complex problems, and weigh conflicting information —basically, to think things through. Interventions that improve problem-solving skills often help with this.</p>
