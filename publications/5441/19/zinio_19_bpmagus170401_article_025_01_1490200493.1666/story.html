<p>SCIENTISTS AROUND THE WORLD are trying to understand the roots of impulsivity and impulse control disorders (a category that includes pathological gambling and kleptomania). There is even an International Society for Research on Impulsivity, founded to promote collaborative study.</p>
<p>Like most human behavior, impulsivity involves complex interactions—how we respond to potential rewards, how we weigh risks, how well we can override emotions with rational reflection (otherwise known as inhibition).</p>
<p>And those factors may not stay static: According to one psychological theory, the quality known as willpower fluctuates due to fatigue, diet, environment, and our own beliefs.</p>
<p>In people with bipolar disorder, emotional regulation also fluctuates with mood shifts.</p>
<p>According to Michael E. Thase, MD, a professor of psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania and a physician at the Philadelphia VA Medical Center, we each have an innate baseline ability to resist emotional impulses, which varies from person to person.</p>
<p>During depressive and hypo/manic episodes, however, that individual default setting goes haywire. Changes in mood are associated with changes in brain activity that can reduce the “inhibitory, thoughtful override that could otherwise rein in spontaneous—and possibly dangerous, even life-threatening—decisions,” Thase explains.</p>
<p>“This might involve things that are rewarding or feel good, like sex, or using drugs, or spending money, or gambling.”</p>
<p>In depression, Thase adds, it may be associated with impulsive suicidal behavior.</p>
<p>Various regions of the brain interact when we make decisions. One area of focus is the nucleus accumbens and its role in the brain’s reward system. This structure helps govern how we react to pleasurable stimuli, mediating the release of dopamine and serotonin.</p>
<p> When British researchers had a group of people with bipolar perform a roulette-style task, they showed stronger activation in the nucleus accumbens than a comparison group of people without bipolar.</p>
<p>That 2014 study also found different patterns of activity within an area called the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (roughly, a “forward and middle” segment) that is active when we are weighing risk versus reward.</p>
<p>Those with bipolar had greater neural activity for risky bets, while those in the comparison group showed more response to “safe” bets.</p>
<p>The ventromedial prefrontal cortex has been implicated in other behaviors that involve deciding between future consequences and immediate pleasure, such as overeating, overspending, and substance overuse.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a neighboring area called the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (“forward and left”) may be “increasingly relevant to our understanding of impulsivity, particularly in people with bipolar disorder,” says Mary L. Phillips, MD, director of the Mood and Brain Laboratory at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine.</p>
<p>In certain situations where a big reward is possible, such as gambling, ventrolateral activity is heightened significantly more in people with bipolar disorder than in those without bipolar.</p>
<p>Futhermore, Phillips and her colleagues have found that the excitement associated with the possibility of a future reward increases disproportionately during mania, feeding even more juice to emotional urges and compromising the ability to regulate them—much as floodwaters may overwhelm a normally sturdy dam.</p>
<p>“These series of vulnerabilities often lead to risky decisions,” Phillips notes.</p>
<p>Phillips is studying how to change the way the brain is wired. The project involves a brain stimulation technique intended to tamp down activity in the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex when anticipating a future reward.</p>
<p>“This could be the first step toward treatment for the underlying brain causes of impulsivity,” she says.</p>

    <h3>Who's the boss?</h3><p>The prefrontal cortex overlays the frontal lobe of the brain and accounts for roughly 12 percent of the organ’s total volume. It is the reasoning part of the brain, central to decision-making, planning, and memory.</p>
<p>It’s also crucial to regulating regions of the brain involved in generating emotions (notably the amygdala) and the motivation/reward system (including the nucleus accumbens).</p>
<p>There’s strong evidence that in people with bipolar, the prefrontal cortex doesn’t always communicate properly with those areas, especially during mood episodes. This makes impulsive behavior more likely, much as the laxer supervision of a substitute teacher allows a classroom of rowdy kids to get out of control.</p>
