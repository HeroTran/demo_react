<p>When it comes to exercising, Newton’s first law of motion says it all: A body at rest stays at rest until an outside force acts on it. Or to put it another way: It’s a lot easier to come up with excuses not to exercise than it is to overcome our natural inertia and get moving.</p>
<p>Personal trainers have heard ’em all: “I just had my hair done.” “I don’t like to sweat.” “I don’t have the right clothes.”</p>
<p>When you’re living with bipolar disorder, the reasons can get a lot more serious: “This depressive episode is sapping my will.” “I’ve gained so much weight on this medication.” “I’m on disability, so I can’t afford a gym membership.”</p>
<p>Once you get around those roadblocks, though, your physical, mental and emotional well-being is bound to improve. In fact, mental health experts increasingly recommend thinking of physical activity as another pillar of your treatment plan, on par with your medication regimen.</p>
<p>Why should moving more be part of your wellness program? For one thing, it’s a natural antidepressant. Heaps of research link exercise to improved mood—both as an immediate pick-me-up and by reducing the risk of future depressive episodes—and stronger resilience, which is the ability to handle stress.</p>
<p>(The majority of studies have focused on major depressive disorder, but those involving bipolar depression show similar results. One caveat: Exercise and elevated mood gets trickier because taking “goal-directed activity” to extremes is an aspect of mania.)</p>
<p>Scientists are trying to puzzle out just how exercise combats depression. One promising candidate is a brain protein called brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). In addition to playing a crucial role in maintaining and creating neurons, BDNF appears to have antidepressant effects.</p>
<p>Physical activity spurs the production of BDNF— not to mention improving oxygen and nutrient flow to your brain.</p>
<p>Researchers wrangle over “exercise dose,” meaning how hard you need to exercise and for how long in order to gain mood benefits. One thing is clear: Any physical activity is better than none. And once you’ve found a way to get your body in motion, you’re more likely to keep building on that step by step.</p>
<p>To help you get the ball rolling, we’ve put together a rundown of common exercise roadblocks and proven ways to overcome them.</p>

<h3><b>ROADBLOCK 1: I don’t have time.</b></h3><p>This is arguably the most common excuse for not working out. The solution: Rethink your expectations.</p>
<p>“We always hear the ‘no time’ excuse but ... people say they have no time because they describe exercise in a very strict way,” says Kathleen Trotter, a Toronto-based personal trainer and author of <i>Finding Your Fit: A Compassionate Trainer’s Guide to Making Fitness a Lifelong Habit.</i></p>
<p>“You may not have time to go to the gym, but you always have time to build movement into your life.”</p>
<p>Trotter recommends structuring tidbits of physical activity into your daily routine. For example, “getting a colleague and going for a 20-minute walk at lunch, or doing calisthenics when you watch TV.”</p>
<p>Again, any little bit of activity is better than none. You might start with something as simple as pacing whenever you talk on the phone or doing one jumping jack every time you go to the bathroom.</p>
<p>Bottom line: “Make movement a nonnegotiable,” Trotter says.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>ROADBLOCK 2: I’m too tired.</b></h3><p> As with “no time,” the answer here is to shift your perspective—namely, lower your standards when necessary.</p>
<p>“You might not have enough energy to go to the gym, but you may have energy to follow the 10-minute rule,” says Trotter.</p>
<p>About that “rule” she’s referring to: It just means doing something physical—anything—for 10 minutes. Even 10 minutes of walking around your house or doing some gentle stretches counts, and it’s better than giving up altogether.</p>
<p>Once you’re moving, that 10 minutes may turn into a longer session.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>ROADBLOCK 3: I hate to exercise.</b></h3><p>You may be tapping into negative associations, such as suffering through gym class or being picked last for a team.</p>
<p>“People fear exercise because of [how physical education] is approached in school,” asserts Pete McCall, MS, a fitness educator based in San Diego, California and a spokesman for the American Council on Exercise.</p>
<p>The trick here is to substitute “pleasant” for “painful” by thinking about what physical activities would be more enjoyable for you.</p>
<p>Consider ways you used to have fun. Did you love riding your bike as a kid? See if you can borrow a bicycle and pedal around the neighborhood. Was Frisbee a favorite, way back when? Invite a friend to toss a disc with you.</p>
<p>Be open to new opportunities. If someone suggests you come along to a yoga class, why not see how it goes?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>ROADBLOCK 4: I’m too out of shape.</b></h3><p>Almost everyone has body shame of some kind or another. When you’re self-conscious, keep in mind that people generally are more interested in their own bodies— and their own workouts—than in checking out yours.</p>
<p>Ironically, people often decide to start exercising because of body image—as in, wanting a “better” appearance. Given our human preference for immediate gratification, however, the lure of future buffness isn’t always enough to overcome exercise inertia.</p>
<p>“There’s so much emphasis on how exercise should make you look,” notes McCall. “Instead, think about how it makes you feel.”</p>
<p>Focusing on the way physical activity relieves stress or staying aware of your boost in mood right afterward not only provides immediate emotional payback, but also reinforces intrinsic motivation, the inner inclination to do something.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>ROADBLOCK 5: I don’t know how to get started.</b></h3><p>Experts recommend a combination of aerobic activity (the kind that raises your heartbeat) and resistance training (activities that strengthen your muscles). Feeling like you don’t know the right way to go about that can be daunting.</p>
<p>“People just don’t know what to do when it comes to exercise and fitness,” says McCall. “There’s almost too much information about what we should be doing. Too much information leads to paralysis, and it’s easier to do nothing.”</p>
<p>A little online research can turn up easy-to-do ideas that don’t require a gym membership, such as bicep curls while holding soup cans or pushups against the wall—or simply standing up and sitting back down a few times in a row.</p>
<p>“A little bit of something is better than a lot of nothing,” says McCall.</p>
<p>If you’re ready (and financially able) for the next level, an ACE-certified personal trainer can develop an individualized workout plan—and help you stay with it, as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>ROADBLOCK 6: I never stick with a workout program.</b></h3><p>You have the best of intentions—but a week or two in, you lose steam and start skipping your planned activity. Discouraged, you decide to quit altogether.</p>
<p>One way to avoid the cycle of doom: Start with a reasonable plan that fits with your lifestyle and current fitness level.</p>
<p>“Your goals have to be specific, small, and attainable,” says health coach Danielle Vindez, MA, of Redondo Beach, California. “Once you are confident that you can meet those small goals, you can move on to making them bigger.”</p>
<p>If you’re just easing into a routine, your goal might be to walk three times a week, for 20 minutes each time. That’s it.</p>
<p>And if you miss a session? Let it go and refocus on—or refine—your plan.</p>
<p>“There’s no perfect day or perfect week,” says Trotter. “Perfect is the enemy of done, so stop trying to find the ‘perfect’ way to work out … do what you can.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>ROADBLOCK 7: I just don’t feel like it.</b></h3><p>When the apathy of bipolar depression creeps in, it’s easy to say “no” to everything, including exercise. You’re also more likely to isolate yourself. Address both issues by enlisting an exercise buddy.</p>
<p>Ask a friend to commit to working out with you, whether it’s meeting for an exercise class or walking in a nearby park. Making a commitment to someone else makes you more likely to stick with it, says Trotter.</p>
<p>You might also consider setting up a reward system—dangling a carrot, so to speak. For example, promise to treat yourself to a new CD after following your exercise plan for two weeks, a new set of headphones after six weeks, and so on.</p>
<p>The idea of a prize gives you an external reason to do something—also known as extrinsic motivation—and may be the extra little bump you need when you’re just not feeling it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>ROADBLOCK 8: Exercise is boring.</b></h3><p>According to Vindez, one reason people get bored with exercise is that they’re not emotionally engaged in what they’re doing.</p>
<p>“Martin Seligman, the founder of positive psychology, described five pillars of well-being that create emotional engagement for people,” she explains. Namely: positive emotions, relationships, engagement, meaning and achievement.</p>
<p>Reflecting on activities you’ve enjoyed in the past can help you pinpoint what you value, which can help you identify similar activities that would keep your interest.</p>
<p>For example, did shooting hoops in the driveway make you feel more relaxed? You’re connecting with positive emotions. Did playing catch with your kids put a smile on your face? You’re plugging into relationships. Did you love the absorption you had during yoga practice? That’s a sense of engagement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>ROADBLOCK 9: I have physical health conditions.</b></h3><p>Sure, that adds to the challenge—but it doesn’t have to be a deal-breaker.</p>
<p>“It’s already hard [for anyone] to work out, and if you have any kind of added impediment, you will have a more uphill battle,” admits Trotter. “So it’s important to come up with strategies that will work for you.”</p>
<p>Consult with your doctor about any restrictions or limitations you may have, including the possible impact of any medications you’re taking. Then consider what you can do rather than what you cannot. If you have arthritis, running may be out of the question, but you can still walk, bike, or swim.</p>
<p>Recognize that just as you have good days and bad days with bipolar, you’ll probably have good and bad days with other conditions as well. It’s better to adapt your activities as needed than to give up altogether.</p>
<p>“Your action plan has to be more targeted to your life and your reality,” says Trotter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>ROADBLOCK 10: I feel too awful to exercise.</b></h3><p>When you’re feeling depressed, anxious, irritable, or hopeless, moving your body may be the last thing you want to do—yet that’s exactly when you need it the most.</p>
<p>“The worse your mood, the more important your workout is,” explains Trotter. “Say you measure your mood on a scale from 1 to 10. If you start your workout at an 8, there’s only so much better you can feel. But when you start at a 1, you have so much room to feel better.”</p>
<p>Instead of thinking about how bad you feel right now, focus on how much better you’ll feel later on. That may be enough of a push to get you—and keep you—in motion.</p>
<p>“Exercise is self-care,” points out Vindez, who has trained clients with bipolar.</p>
<p>Since physical well-being is “the foundation for your emotional and spiritual wellness,” she adds, “start at that foundational level … with baby steps that build energy.”</p>
