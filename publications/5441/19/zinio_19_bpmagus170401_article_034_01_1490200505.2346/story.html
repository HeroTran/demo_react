<p>Early on in what would become an illustrious career, policy wonk Robert O. Boorstin made a somewhat startling revelation to a colleague.</p>
<p>As he recalls it: “I told a young woman who I was working with that some day she may get a strange call from the police or hospital that something weird is going on with me. I said, ‘Here is my shrink’s name and number. Call him immediately when this happens.’”</p>
<p>At the time, Boorstin was working for the presidential campaign of then Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis. Boorstin had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder six months before, at the age of 27.</p>
<p>Boorstin did go on to experience a psychotic break and thankfully, his colleague did as he had asked.</p>
<p>The details of that episode remain muddied for Boorstin, now 57. He knows he was taken to Massachusetts General Hospital and then transferred to McLean Hospital, a prominent psychiatric facility in the Boston area, where he was stabilized with medications. However, that’s not the end of the story he shared during his keynote speech at the Brain &amp; Behavior Research Foundation’s 28th annual International Mental Health Research Symposium in New York City.</p>
<p>Boorstin later learned that his health insurer refused to cover his stay at McLean because he had reached his lifetime limit on mental health care. McLean “declined to take me until they got the guarantee of the $18,000 [fee] from my brother,” he explained during an interview with <i>bp Magazine</i> after his talk.</p>
<p>Small wonder that Boorstin has become a champion of mental health parity in insurance coverage, as well as an advocate for awareness and acceptance of brain-based disorders—especially relating to workplace and career issues.</p>
<p>“When something really bad happens to you, you have three choices: denial, pity or action,” Boorstin said. “Denial doesn’t come very naturally to me. Pity? Well, I tried that and it came fairly naturally to me.”</p>
<p>It was anger at the way health insurance worked that helped turn his self-pity into action. His first move: “I hired lawyers in Boston and eventually won a settlement.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>AN OPEN CASE</b></h3><p>About a month after that episode, Boorstin was back on the job with the Dukakis campaign—right through to the bitter end in November 1988.</p>
<p>Many colleagues questioned why he would be so open about having bipolar, Boorstin recalled in his talk. “They asked, ‘Why would you be so stupid as to talk about something that personal, that embarrassing and that potentially harmful to your career?’”</p>
<p>The answer was fairly simple: “I wanted to prove to people that you could have the illness and yet function at a high-pressure job,” said Boorstin, who is now a senior vice president at Albright Stonebridge Group, a global consultancy firm in Washington, DC.</p>
<p>According to a 2000 study from Boston University’s Center for Psychiatric Rehabilitation, out of 500 professionals and managers in a range of occupations who were dealing with a serious mental illness, fully 73 percent were employed.</p>
<p>Furthermore, 62 percent of respondents had held their current position for more than two years, and just shy of 70 percent had increased their responsibilities since starting their current job.</p>
<p>Boorstin’s own résumé includes stints as director of public policy for Google, vice president at the think tank Center for American Progress, and seven years with the administration of President Bill Clinton—as chief speechwriter at the National Security Council and senior advisor to the Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of State. Before that he was a reporter for the <i>New York Times</i>.</p>
<p>Boorstin was candid about his illness when he joined the Clinton campaign in 1992.</p>

    </div><p>“The person who brought me on, George Stephanopoulos, had been a friend from my Dukakis days and was fully aware of my condition from the start,” he told <i>bp</i>.</p>
<p>However, he acknowledged that there’s no one-size-fits-all time to open up about bipolar disorder or another mental health issue in the workplace.</p>
<p>“I would never tell anyone to disclose their mental illness unless they are very comfortable,” he says.</p>
<p>He also advises against revealing a diagnosis during job interviews, noting that it’s illegal for employers to ask.</p>
<p>“I don’t believe you should do it before you are hired, ever, because it shapes their thinking and you don’t want to be seen as a risk. The last thing any business wants is uncertainty.”</p>
<p>Jeffrey Borenstein, MD, president and CEO of the Brain &amp; Behavior Research Foundation and host of the public television series <i>Healthy Minds with Dr. Jeffrey Borenstein</i>, agreed that there is no right or wrong time to disclose mental illness at work.</p>
<p>“This is a very individualized decision that depends upon the type of work a person does, where they are professionally, their relations with superiors and peers, and where they are clinically,” Borenstein said.</p>
<p>In Boorstin’s view, however, there are benefits to disclosure that help offset any risks.</p>
<p>“After you get the job, tell your boss and a colleague so … when things go south, people are prepared. The worst thing you can do is to catch people by surprise,” he said.</p>
<p>With your diagnosis out in the open, he added, co-workers have a context if you can’t come to work because of depressive fatigue or extreme irritability.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>SCHEDULING FOR STRESS</b></h3><p>Boorstin would agree that staying balanced in the face of a stressful job can be a challenge. In the Boston study, participants reported a range of on-the-job coping mechanisms, including taking breaks and using flex time.</p>
<p>In many of his jobs, Boorstin has been able to set his own schedule.</p>
<p>“If I am not up for going into work, I don’t go and then I work at night. I can do a meeting on the phone if I have to,” he said. “Flexible hours reduce stress.”</p>
<p>Even if he works late, though, he makes sure to get to bed between 11:30 p.m. and midnight.</p>
<p>“I used to be a 2 a.m. guy and that is disastrous. You are asking to be irritable,” he noted.</p>
<p>His exercise routine also helps.</p>
<p>“I use a treadmill every day before I go to work. It wakes me up, gets my mind working, and gets the synapses firing.”</p>
<p>As Boorstin has discovered, consistent routine is an essential element in managing bipolar. Paid employment creates a ready-made structure, but he believes signing up for volunteer work with consistent hours can accomplish the same goal—and maybe more.</p>
<p>“The worst thing is not having a schedule … and a volunteer job could also lead to a real one,” he pointed out.</p>
<p>Boorstin is also a passionate fan of giving back.</p>
<p>“I can honestly say the most fulfilling moments in my life have come when I help people like me who have mental illness,” he said.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>A LUCKY MAN</b></h3><p>Boorstin has a love-hate relationship with the meds that keep him stable. In his opinion, “even the best drugs suck”—but he’s well aware of the consequences of noncompliance.</p>
<p>“If you get off of them and are really unlucky, you will wind up in the hospital, and if you are just unlucky, you will have terrible mood swings that kill productivity and ruin relationships,” he said.</p>
<p>Thinking of his family helps him stay on the path: “If I go off my medications, it’s a direct threat to my children and a threat to their education and food on the table. I also keep my mom in mind.”</p>
<p>Boorstin’s loved ones are his lookouts. They will tell him or his therapist if he starts to exhibit signs of hypomania such as glibness, frivolous spending, or going into overdrive with his writing.</p>
<p>“My family has stuck with me through tremendous embarrassment. They have come to the mental hospital to see me, and put me ‘on the couch’ when I am down, and said things when they think I am rising,” he said. “I am lucky in that I have people who care.</p>
<p>“Nobody has been as lucky as me.”</p>

    <h2><b>What to fight for</b></h2><p><b>Advocating for better mental health care</b> can help make a difference for all individuals affected by chronic brain-based disorders—and everyone can do something, says Robert O. Boorstin.</p>
<p>“Let’s tell the stories of the military and veterans whose experiences in war have left them marked by trauma. We need more money, nurses, psychologists and social workers to care for our veterans.”</p>
<p><i>bp Magazine</i> caught up with Boorstin at the Brain &amp; Behavior Research Foundation’s annual symposium in New York City.</p>
<p>After nearly 30 years of working in public policy circles, Boorstin has a few ideas about how to improve society’s approach to people with brain-based disorders.</p>
<p>He’s emphatic that expanding mental health services is only part of the equation. A comprehensive solution would require criminal justice reform, as well as a ban on automatic weapons to help prevent lone-shooter tragedies.</p>
<p>“In the 21st century, it’s easier to get an automatic weapon than it is to get treatment for mental health,” he said.</p>
<p>Advocates have been more successful with legislation that mandates insurance coverage for behavioral health conditions on par with medical conditions—though work remains to be done in that area.</p>
<p>According to Jeffrey Borenstein, MD, president and CEO of the Brain &amp; Behavior Research Foundation, federal parity laws haven’t been enforced as fully as they should be.</p>
<p>“Speak up if you feel that your care is not similar to how it would be if you had another type of medical problem,” Borenstein said.</p>
<p>That might involve reaching out to insurers and to elected officials at all levels of government.</p>
<p>Maintaining equal coverage for behavioral health conditions helps lower financial barriers to getting needed treatment. Individuals who are able to go public with their own challenges and successes chip away at other kinds of barriers, Borenstein noted.</p>
<p>“There still is a stigma toward people with bipolar disorder and other psychological conditions, but it is improving,” he said. “People like Bob Boorstin and others who speak out about their conditions show us that with proper treatment and support of family and friends, people can lead full, healthy, productive lives.”</p>
