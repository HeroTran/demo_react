<h3><b>Establishing boundaries is a challenge for me. Maybe if I understood this better, I would have successful relationships.</b></h3><p>Personal boundaries are dynamic. For the average person, boundaries mean distinguishing one’s self, or ego (what makes me <i>me</i>), from that of others. Psychodynamic theory proclaims the “id” to be the primitive elements of desire, while the “ego” negotiates the world and its boundaries. Boundaries may be self-imposed (the “superego”) or by other authority. Sigmund Freud, the founder of the psychodynamic approach to psychology, described the human psyche as made up of these three aspects—the primitive, impulsive id; the reasonable, decision-making ego; and the superego, which incorporates the values and morals of society and seeks to mediate between the chaotically self-absorbed id and the rigidly rational ego.</p>
<p>Boundaries can be a challenge at the best of times, but in the context of bipolar disorder, boundaries are often shattered by mood swings. At one end of the spectrum, “dilute” boundaries (overfamiliarity) can lead to dangerous situations, while at the other extreme, impenetrable boundaries can prevent loved ones from helping in times of need.</p>
<h3><b>How do boundaries in my close relationships impact my quality of life?</b></h3><p>Personal boundaries in close relationships have many facets and directly affect illness outcomes in physical and mental health domains. The questionnaire “Experiences in Close Relationships” (ECR) measures the ability to be close with one’s partner, the capacity to share feelings and emotions and to provide and accept support, as well as negative elements, such as feeling that the partner makes one doubt oneself or having preoccupations of abandonment. The ECR is a measure of healthy boundaries in an intimate partnership and is a predictor of the degree of support a relationship will bring in the context of an illness. Secure relationships are associated with lower rates of depression in physical disorders, such as cancer. Research from our group at the University of Michigan found that social and personal relationships, including the capacity for attachment, were often compromised among people with bipolar disorder.</p>
<p>A further point to consider is social undermining. Undermining is when others conspire (wittingly or unwittingly) to impede the success of an individual. Undermining is very destructive; it contributes to perceived boundaries and often results in failed careers and social and personal relationships. Social support is wonderful, but often no amount of social support can overcome the boundaries that undermining presents.</p>

<h3><b>How do you set boundaries, anyway?</b></h3><p>A practical approach to establishing boundaries can be found in business writings. William Ury’s <i>The Power of a Positive No</i> provides guidelines on how to say “No” effectively and respectfully in almost any situation, while identifying actions and strategies toward an acceptable outcome. The essence of the argument is that, for example, if a friend asks you for a personal favor that is uncomfortable, you respond with a counter offer and negotiate toward agreement, rather than responding with a blunt “No.” Naturally there are times when a more forceful “NO!” is needed, but in the course of interactions with close friends and family, this kind of response may be seen as aggressive and is liable to raise more concerns, especially when loved ones perceive a need for help.</p>

<h3><b>What are the top 5 things I can work on right now?</b></h3><p>Talk to a therapist about boundaries, and when and how to set them:</p>
<p><b>1.</b> Work toward strategies for a supportive experience in your close relationships.</p>
<p><b>2.</b> Determine whether or not boundaries are inhibiting your personal intimacy.</p>
<p><b>3.</b> Practice the power of a positive “No.” If you are not using a “No” on at least a weekly basis, ask your therapist if perhaps you might be too agreeable and might have difficulties setting limits and boundaries.</p>
<p><b>4.</b> Practice identifying your needs and asking someone for help.</p>
<p><b>5.</b> If you perceive that someone is engaged in undermining your ability to succeed, work with your therapist to develop effective countermeasures.</p>
