<h3><b>All clear</b></h3><p><b>Clutter in our living spaces can send our stress levels through the roof. Trying to decide what to give up, though, can be just as frustrating.</b></p>
<p>Take the pain out of decluttering by taking these tips from certified feng shui consultant Marianne Gordon:</p>

<ol>

<li><b>Fill a garbage bag with items to donate.</b> If you keep thinking about something in the bag, remove it the next day. To experience the immediate relief of decluttering, drop everything else off at a donation bank within two to three days.</li>

<li><b>Scan your rooms.</b> Does that coffee table knick-knack complement your décor, or did you buy it because it was on sale? If the latter, discard.</li>

<li><b>Get rid of any mementos</b> associated with less-than-happy memories.</li>

</ol>

    </div><h3>A sound transition</h3><p><b>Spring brings with it more daylight—and, with that, a greater temptation to stay up later.</b></p>
<p>To maintain a healthy sleep schedule during this seasonal change, invest in blackout shades or curtains and draw them several hours before bedtime to cue your body to settle down.</p>
<p>If you suffer from springtime allergies, using a neti pot or another nasal rinse can combat allergens that disrupt breathing patterns and threaten a solid slumber.</p>
<p>For evening snacks, choose foods that contain tryptophan and other sleep-enhancing substances. Some go-to options: walnuts, almonds, bananas, hummus and cheese.</p>

    </div><h3>Lean in (and hug)</h3><p><b>We’re often told to “lean in” to work—to push harder, to achieve more. Instead, psychiatrist Robert Waldinger thinks we should lean in to relationships.</b></p>
<p>That means less Facebook and more face time. Letting go of grudges. Perking up stale friendships with fresh activities.</p>
<p>“Giving people our full, undivided attention is probably the most valuable thing we have to offer,” Waldinger says.</p>
<p>He should know: Waldinger is the current director of the Harvard Study of Adult Development, which, in tracking participants over a whopping 75 years, has found that those with strong ties are both happier and healthier.</p>
