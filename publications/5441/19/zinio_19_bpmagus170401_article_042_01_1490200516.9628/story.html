<p>As activity director at a senior residential facility, Katie Dale spends her day interacting with people struggling with dementia. When one of the residents was worried that her husband was stuck at home alone, Dale patiently promised to check on his wellbeing—although she knew the woman was a widow.</p>
<p>It wasn’t training or work experience that gave Dale the empathy to calm the woman and get her engaged in the weekly bingo game. Instead, Dale credits her own journey with bipolar disorder.</p>
<p>“I understood her because I know how altered realities can be believable in a psychotic frame of mind,” says Dale, who is 29. “I also feel like I ‘get’ them because my brain felt scrambled a lot in manic psychosis and on minimum sleep.”</p>
<p>Dale was diagnosed with bipolar I at age 16 after being hospitalized during a manic episode. She spent her 20s learning to manage her brain-based chronic illness at a time when she was still figuring out a lot about who she was and experimenting with how to establish herself as an adult.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>CAREER PATH</b></h3><p>Stabilized with proper treatment, Dale attended a local community college for two years, then graduated from Roberts Wesleyan College in upstate New York with a bachelor’s degree in business administration. She recalls the campus environment as a safe place to practice finding and making the right kind of friends.</p>
<p>While socializing could be a challenge, schoolwork came easy and Dale was able to keep up a high GPA throughout her studies.</p>
<p>She soon found work as a graphic designer, but the deadline pressure was triggering for her bipolar symptoms. She ended up quitting as part of a larger effort to reduce stress in her life, leaving her jobless a few years out of college.</p>
<p>She stumbled into her current career by happy accident. While deciding her next steps, she volunteered at a retirement community because she remembered how much she had loved giving musical performances at her grandfather’s nursing home.</p>
<p>“I realized that working with seniors was something that I could do for a living. I was fulfilled and satisfied, and I felt like my work was not a job, but a joy,” says Dale.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>THE DATING GAME</b></h3><p>As with most young adults, dating and looking for true love was an important part of Dale’s 20s—complicated in her case by her bipolar illness.</p>
<p>She tried one relationship in college with a boyfriend who had his own psychiatric diagnosis, believing they had the advantage of understanding each other’s challenges. Her mother thought the opposite, and in this case mother did know best: The relationship turned out to be tumultuous and short-lived.</p>
<p>When Dale met the man who is now her husband, she was upfront about having bipolar early on. His reaction: Wanting to learn as much as possible about the condition. Like something out of a fairy tale, they got engaged after a quick courtship and were married 14 months after their first date.</p>
<p>Dale says that meeting and marrying such a supportive man was life-changing.</p>
<p>“He is very in tune to my moods and can tell when something is off with me, sometimes before I know. He helps make sure that I am taking my medicine and keep my doctor and therapist appointments. Most importantly, he is always there for me and always ready to listen,” she says.</p>
<p>Her husband’s knowledge and understanding helped them weather an episode of mania and psychosis that led to her second hospitalization. At that point, they’d been married three years. Dale insisted she wanted a divorce. Luckily, he recognized that as a symptom of the mania, not something she really wanted.</p>
<p>“When I’m stable I would never talk about divorcing my husband. Chris was so patient with me and loving. It hurt him, but he stood by my side and endured this time,” Dale says.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>MANAGING MEDICATION</b></h3><p>It’s said that experience is the best teacher, and Dale is not alone in learning the hard way that an effective medication regimen is the bedrock of wellness. The manic episode that threatened her marriage was the direct result of quitting her meds.</p>
<p>At that point, Dale had been stable for some years. She was 24, she believed she was cured, and she decided she didn’t need her medication anymore.</p>
<p>When Dale discussed the idea with her doctor, he talked about lowering her dosage. She convinced herself that the doctor said she could taper off entirely.</p>
<p>“Nobody, no matter how close to me—even my husband or brother—could reason with me to stay on my medication,” she recalls. “I just don’t know if there are magic words to convince someone to stay on their medicine when they are in that state of mind.”</p>
<p>Spending two months in and out of psychiatric facilities was plenty persuasive.</p>
<p>“I’m now back to living a full life, because I take my medicine every day and have no plans to stop again,” she says.</p>
<p>In addition to accepting the need for medication compliance, Dale focused on reducing her stress, seeing a therapist, and going for a run almost every day. She also credits her faith as her anchor and a large part of why she is stable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>SELF-EXPLORATION</b></h3><p>Expressing her feelings through writing has been another anchor for Dale. She began journaling about her experiences with bipolar when she was 19. She even announced to a doctor during her first hospitalization as a teenager that she would write a memoir, which she is currently finishing up.</p>
<p>She also started a blog in 2014 called Bipolar Brave that combines her own impressions, guest posts, and interviews with experts. She often explores topics that she herself wants to learn more about, such as what to consider if she and her husband choose to start a family.</p>
<p>“It’s a labor of love because there is so much that I still can’t understand. I know someone out there is either going through the same thing or wants to better understand someone they love.</p>
<p>“When someone around you is struggling with bipolar, you have no idea what is going on in their mind,” she adds. “It’s my way of telling my loved ones my side of the story.”</p>

    <h2><b>Katie's Tips</b></h2><p><b>Here’s a short list of what helps Katie Dale deal with stress and stay in balance:</b></p>
<p><b>RUNNING:</b> Ever since high school, I’ve tried to run as much as possible, even when I was sick. It’s a way to keep healthy—not just your mind but [also] your body. My mom always said, “Behavior change produces feeling change,” so when I’m in a slump I go out and run. I firmly believe that the physical, mental, emotional and spiritual all tie together.</p>
<p><b>ROUTINE:</b> I get up every morning and have my coffee. I get something to eat and take my medicine with some water. Even when I’m depressed or manic, I always drink my coffee, so having a routine helps me always remember to take my medicine.</p>
<p><b>PRAYER:</b> I keep close to God and pray and read His word. I need someone who would listen to my anxieties and be a shoulder to cry on. God brings me peace, and delighting in Him brings me my heart’s desires. He’s there when no one else is.</p>
