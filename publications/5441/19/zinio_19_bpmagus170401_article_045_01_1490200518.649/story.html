<p>Early in my treatment for bipolar disorder, I had a doctor who urged me to accept my “disability” and pursue more “realistic” career options—ones that did not involve returning to the pressure cooker of an Ivy League university to complete my undergraduate degree.</p>
<p>I suppose it wasn’t unreasonable advice at the time. While I now could be considered something of a poster boy for thriving with bipolar, for me there was no quick and fortunate return to regular life after I was diagnosed at age 20 during a severe manic episode.</p>
<p>I had trouble finding medications that worked. I encountered doctor after doctor who failed to take my symptoms and side effects seriously. I began to feel I was facing a lifelong sentence of uncertainty and illness.</p>
<p>For years, I saw my bipolar as something separate from me, a wild unknown with the power to render mania indistinguishable from reality and establish crippling depression as my new normal.</p>
<p>At 22, I was still out of school, unemployed, pretty much off of medications, and opposed to new treatments because I felt I had tried every pill.</p>
<p>I was living in my older sister’s attic. I went weeks without interacting with anyone besides her. I had gained 40 pounds, lost all interest in completing school, and abandoned hygiene to such a degree that my mother would cry whenever I allowed her to visit.</p>
<p>I resisted any inclination towards hope, for it had disappointed me too many times. This, I was convinced, would be my life now. This was my surrender. This, ultimately, was my acceptance of illness.</p>
<p>Somehow this complete rejection of hope, this surrender that accepted defeat, cleared the way for something, anything else.</p>
<p>Fast forward three years: I am completing my final year at Harvard University. I work for an amazing nonprofit health agency that provides free medical and mental health care in disadvantaged communities. I am setting my sights towards graduate school.</p>
<p>When I am asked how I moved from illness to recovery, I find it hard to summarize an answer. It is rare for a recovery journey to follow a linear path. I think of mine as a chaotic collection of relapses and rallies.</p>
<p>Every new chapter of my recovery began with a heightened awareness of my limitations, but also of a capacity for resilience I did not know I possessed.</p>
<p>Of course, there were decisions along the way that made a difference. I found a new doctor who believed in my ability to be successful while living with this brain-based disorder and who customized a treatment plan that worked.</p>
<p>I started a volunteer job that turned into an English instructor position at a middle school. I slowly re-established relationships with friends who repeatedly confirmed their belief in me. Perhaps most importantly, I had a family willing to support and sustain me even when none of us understood what was happening.</p>
<p>Accepting the reality of my rock bottom opened the door to other important forms of acceptance. While I consider myself extremely fortunate to have a second chance, so to speak, I have come to accept that this recovery business is continuous and never-ending.</p>
<p>I have come to accept that my strengths cannot be separated from the challenges I face as a person living with bipolar. My big personality and bursts of creativity are connected to my periods of depression and self-isolation.</p>
<p>I have come to accept that my illness is not a foreign entity attacking my body. It is a part of me that I carry equally into my psychiatrist’s office, my college classes, and my work with LGBTQ peers facing their own mental health challenges. It is something I will carry with me when I reach for my diploma at my graduation ceremony this spring.</p>
