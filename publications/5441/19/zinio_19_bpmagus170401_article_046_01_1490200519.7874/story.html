<p><b>Business executive KATHERINE SWITZ was diagnosed with bipolar I while earning her MBA at Harvard Business School. After nearly 20 years in international development and consulting, she founded and runs The Stability Network, recruiting professionals to share their stories of living with brain-based disorders. She is also executive director of the Many Minds Collaborative in Seattle and mother to a preschooler.</b></p>
<h4><b>How do you manage work-life balance?</b></h4><p>I have a very focused, structured workday. I work 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. and never any later, and never on weekends. After 5 p.m. I turn off my phone. I spend 20 minutes every morning reflecting on making my work day manageable. Every week, I plan with my therapist—we boot up the computer, we review my calendar for the week, and we triage.</p>
<h4><b>How about your husband’s role?</b></h4><p>He travels about 30 percent of the time, so I’m a single mom a lot, but in terms of managing my bipolar illness he’s a huge partner. I told him I had bipolar disorder on our first date—“Go out and research it and see if you want a second date.” When I was hospitalized a few weeks after our wedding [in 2005], he became very involved in researching medication and strategies to stay well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><b>So what strategies work for you?</b></h4><p>I exercise daily. I go to bed at 8:45 p.m. to get nine hours of sleep a night. I meditate every morning for 10 minutes. I added the meditation about a year ago, and reflection on my workday about six months ago. It’s a work-in-progress.</p>
<h4><b>What’s hardest about staying well in a demanding job?</b></h4><p>Interpersonal stress—managing complex relationships in a work setting—is the most challenging thing for me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><b>What helps the most with that?</b></h4><p>Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT). I apply it every single day. Every night I track what skills I used, all my emotions, in a spread sheet. Mindfulness, interpersonal effectiveness, distress tolerance—all the modules of DBT have changed my life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><b>Speaking of interpersonal stress, how about parenting?</b></h4><p>I don’t find my son triggering. For some reason being a mom has been a natural role for me. Not that I don’t get frustrated, but he doesn’t trigger my psychosis.</p>
<h4><b>How do you keep working during depressive periods?</b></h4><p>I keep trying to do the next thing. I just say, “I’ve got to brush my teeth.” Then I say, “I’ve got to take a shower.” The alternative is lying in bed feeling awful and that’s worse for me than just trying to get through the day. I also try to do something nice to improve the situation—call a friend, sit by a pretty view. I validate my emotions: “I’m feeling depressed. It’s not my fault, it’s OK to take a breath or take a break.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><b>After your diagnosis, what helped you feel you could still succeed in your goals?</b></h4><p>I asked the doctors at the hospital, “Can I get back to school, can I go on to a demanding corporate career?” They said, “We don’t know. It can go either way.” My mom brought me Kay Jamison’s <i>An Unquiet Mind</i>. I showed it to the social worker and said, “I don’t know how this woman did it, but I’m going to do it, too.”</p>
<h4><b>So you’re returning the favor with The Stability Network?</b></h4><p>I realized people like me had to speak out, and if we organized a lot of people to speak up that would be even more powerful. I want people to feel hope that they can get better and I want people to get concrete information or insight into how other people have gotten better.</p>
<h4><b>What advice would you give your just-diagnosed younger self?</b></h4><p>Keep going. Keep trying. If you can’t find a doctor who helps, find another doctor. If you can’t find a med regimen that works, try another. It’ll get better.</p>
