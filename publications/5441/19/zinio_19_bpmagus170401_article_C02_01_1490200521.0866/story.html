<p><b>Bipolar disorder</b> is a treatable illness marked by extreme changes in mood, thought, energy, and behavior. Bipolar disorder is also known as manic depression because a person’s mood can alternate between the “poles”—mania (highs) and depression (lows). The change in mood can last for hours, days, weeks, or months.</p>

<h3><b>What bipolar is not</b></h3><p>Bipolar disorder is not a character flaw or sign of personal weakness.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Whom bipolar disorder affects</b></h3><p> Bipolar disorder affects more than 5.7 million adult Americans and 440,000 adult Canadians. It usually begins in late adolescence, often appearing as depression during teen years, although it can start in early childhood or later in life.</p>
<p>An equal number of men and women develop this illness. Men tend to begin with a manic episode, women with a depressive episode. Bipolar disorder is found among all ages, races, ethnic groups, and social classes.The illness tends to run in families and appears to have a genetic link.</p>
<p>Like depression and other serious illnesses, bipolar disorder can also negatively affect spouses, partners, family members, friends, and co-workers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Types of bipolar disorder</b></h3><p>Different types of bipolar disorder are determined by patterns and severity of symptoms of highs and lows.</p>
<p><b>BIPOLAR I DISORDER</b> is characterized by one or more manic episodes that last at least a week or require hospitalization.</p>
<p>Episodes of depression and hypomania may also occur. Some mood episodes may have mixed features (symptoms of both depression and mania/hypomania).</p>
<p>Behavior during mania and disability during bipolar depression can lead to severe financial, family and social disruption.</p>
<p><b> BIPOLAR II DISORDER</b> is characterized by one or more depressive episodes accompanied by at least one hypomanic episode. Hypomanic episodes have symptoms similar to manic episodes but are less extreme and don’t last as long. However, the person’s behavior is clearly different from the norm to observers.</p>
<p><b>CYCLOTHYMIC DISORDER</b> is characterized by chronic mood fluctuations that do not reach the level of a full manic or depressive episode. However, symptoms cause significant distress in personal relationships, work or school, and other areas of life when they occur. Although symptoms are relatively mild compared to Bipolar I or Bipolar II, they recur within two months each time. People with cyclothymia may go on to develop a more extreme form of bipolar illness.</p>

<h3><b>Symptoms of bipolar disorder</b></h3><p>Most people who have bipolar disorder talk about experiencing “highs” and “lows.” These swings can be severe, ranging from extreme energy to deep despair. The severity of the mood swings and the way they disrupt normal life activities distinguish bipolar mood episodes from ordinary mood changes.</p>
<h4><b>SYMPTOMS OF MANIA:</b></h4><p>• Increased physical and mental activity and energy</p>
<p>• Heightened mood, exaggerated optimism and self-confidence</p>
<p>• Excessive irritability, aggressive behavior</p>
<p>• Decreased need for sleep without experiencing fatigue</p>
<p>• Racing speech, thoughts, and flight of ideas</p>
<p>• Increased sexual drive</p>
<p>• Reckless behavior</p>
<h4><b>SYMPTOMS OF DEPRESSION:</b></h4><p>• Prolonged sadness or unexplained crying spells, profound hopelessness</p>
<p> • Significant changes in appetite and sleep patterns</p>
<p>• Irritability, anger, worry, agitation, anxiety</p>
<p>• Pessimism, loss of energy, persistent lethargy</p>
<p>• Feelings of guilt and worthlessness</p>
<p>• Inability to concentrate, indecisiveness</p>
<p>• Recurring thoughts of death and suicide</p>

<h3><b>How common is bipolar disorder in children?</b></h3><p>Because bipolar disorder tends to run in families, having a parent with bipolar increases the likelihood that a child also will develop bipolar. When one parent has bipolar disorder, the risk to each child is estimated to be 15–30 percent. When both parents have the disorder, the risk increases to 50–75 percent.</p>
<p>Symptoms of mood disorders may be difficult to recognize in children and adolescents because they can be mistaken for age-appropriate emotions and behaviors, or overlap with symptoms of other conditions such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). However, depression and anxiety in children may be precursors to bipolar and should be carefully evaluated and monitored.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Treatment for bipolar disorder</b></h3><p>Several therapies exist for bipolar disorder and promising new treatments are currently under investigation. Because bipolar disorder can be difficult to treat, it is highly recommended that you consult a psychiatrist or a general practitioner with experience in treating this illness. Treatments may include medication, talk therapy, and support groups.</p>
