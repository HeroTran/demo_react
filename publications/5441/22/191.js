Bipolar disorder is also known as manic depression because a person’s mood can alternate between the “poles”—mania (highs) and depression (lows). The change in mood can last for hours, days, weeks, or months.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><b>What bipolar is not</b></h2><p>Bipolar disorder is not a character flaw or sign of personal weakness.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><b>Whom bipolar disorder affects</b></h2><p> Bipolar disorder affects more than 5.7 million adult Americans and 440,000 adult Canadians. It usually begins in late adolescence, often appearing as depression during teen years, although it can start in early childhood or later in life.</p>\n<p>An equal number of men and women develop this illness. Men tend to begin with a manic episode, women with a depressive episode. Bipolar disorder is found among all ages, races, ethnic groups, and social classes.The illness tends to run in families and appears to have a genetic link.</p>\n<p>Like depression and other serious illnesses, bipolar disorder can also negatively affect spouses, partners, family members, friends, and co-workers.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><b>Types of bipolar disorder</b></h2><p>Different types of bipolar disorder are determined by patterns and severity of symptoms of highs and lows.</p>\n<p><b>BIPOLAR I DISORDER</b> is characterized by one or more manic episodes that last at least a week or require hospitalization.</p>\n<p>Episodes of depression and hypomania may also occur. Some mood episodes may have mixed features (symptoms of both depression and mania/hypomania).</p>\n<p>Behavior during mania and disability during bipolar depression can lead to severe financial, family and social disruption.</p>\n<p><b>BIPOLAR II DISORDER</b> is characterized by one or more depressive episodes accompanied by at least one hypomanic episode. Hypomanic episodes have symptoms similar to manic episodes but are less extreme and don’t last as long. However, the person’s behavior is clearly different from the norm to observers.</p>\n<p><b>CYCLOTHYMIC DISORDER</b> is characterized by chronic mood fluctuations that do not reach the level of a full manic or depressive episode. However, symptoms cause significant distress in personal relationships, work or school, and other areas of life when they occur. Although symptoms are relatively mild compared to Bipolar I or Bipolar II, they recur within two months each time. People with cyclothymia may go on to develop a more extreme form of bipolar illness.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><b>Symptoms of bipolar disorder</b></h2><p>Most people who have bipolar disorder talk about experiencing “highs” and “lows.” These swings can be severe, ranging from extreme energy to deep despair. The severity of the mood swings and the way they disrupt normal life activities distinguish bipolar mood episodes from ordinary mood changes.</p>\n<h2><b>SYMPTOMS OF MANIA:</b></h2><p>• Increased physical and mental activity and energy</p>\n<p>• Heightened mood, exaggerated optimism and self-confidence</p>\n<p>• Excessive irritability, aggressive behavior</p>\n<p>• Decreased need for sleep without experiencing fatigue</p>\n<p>• Racing speech, thoughts, and flight of ideas</p>\n<p>• Increased sexual drive</p>\n<p>• Reckless behavior</p>\n<h2><b>SYMPTOMS OF DEPRESSION:</b></h2><p>• Prolonged sadness or unexplained crying spells, profound hopelessness</p>\n<p>• Significant changes in appetite and sleep patterns</p>\n<p>• Irritability, anger, worry, agitation, anxiety</p>\n<p>• Pessimism, loss of energy, persistent lethargy</p>\n<p>• Feelings of guilt and worthlessness</p>\n<p>• Inability to concentrate, indecisiveness</p>\n<p>• Recurring thoughts of death and suicide</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><b>How common is bipolar disorder in children?</b></h2><p>Because bipolar disorder tends to run in families, having a parent with bipolar increases the likelihood that a child also will develop bipolar. When one parent has bipolar disorder, the risk to each child is estimated to be 15–30 percent. When both parents have the disorder, the risk increases to 50–75 percent.</p>\n<p>Symptoms of mood disorders may be difficult to recognize in children and adolescents because they can be mistaken for age-appropriate emotions and behaviors, or overlap with symptoms of other conditions such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). However, depression and anxiety in children may be precursors to bipolar and should be carefully evaluated and monitored.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><b>Treatment for bipolar disorder</b></h2><p>Several therapies exist for bipolar disorder and promising new treatments are currently under investigation. Because bipolar disorder can be difficult to treat, it is highly recommended that you consult a psychiatrist or a general practitioner with experience in treating this illness. Treatments may include medication, talk therapy, and support groups.</p>\n","layout":{},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":1,"link_source":"","competition":[],"flatplan_title":"","notes":"","gutter_credit":"","other":"","image":[{"id":"722a8632994b0afbe91bb3bf48256fb4","name":"bp-magazine-icon","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_5441/storage/images/media2/images/bp-magazine-icon4/74795-1-eng-GB/bp-magazine-icon.jpg?t=default_ipad_portrait&ext/bp-magazine-icon_default_ipad_portrait.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"768","height":"768","legacy_id":"4595","is_default":true},{"id":"722a8632994b0afbe91bb3bf48256fb4","name":"bp-magazine-icon","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_5441/storage/images/media2/images/bp-magazine-icon4/74795-1-eng-GB/bp-magazine-icon.jpg?t=default_ipad_landscape&ext/bp-magazine-icon_default_ipad_landscape.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"768","height":"768","legacy_id":"4595","is_default":false}],"url_alias":"http://bpmagazine.audiencemedia.com","type":"story","order":"0","folio_number":"C2","folio_numbers":"C2","pdf_page_index":"0","thumbnail":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_5441/storage/images/media2/images/bp-magazine-icon4/74795-1-eng-GB/bp-magazine-icon.jpg?t=tablet_story_thumbnail&ext/bp-magazine-icon_tablet_story_thumbnail.jpg","color":"FFFFFF","real_id":"4565","main_section_id":"191","ads":[]},{"id":"zinio_22_bpmagus170601_article_003_01_1498212067.2657","title":"Landmark Decisions","sub_title":"","author":[{"id":"0","name":"Joanne M.

But there’s a way bigger picture to consider: What are your values and goals? What’s your truest vision of a satisfying and fulfilling life? For a lot of people, that ideal includes having a job.</p>\n<p>The good news is that—depending on which study you look at—from half to three-fourths of people with bipolar have some form of paid employment. Symptoms don’t stay home when you go to work, though. What happens when that affects your job performance and job security? “What to Say at Work—and When” looks at how to decide if you want to take advantage of legal protections and ask for accommodations.</p>\n<p>“A Safe Space” tackles another serious subject: Getting hospitalized during a severe mood episode. Whether it turns out to be a hateful experience or a helpful respite, there are times when a hospital stay is absolutely necessary for your welfare.</p>\n<p>Recalling a manic episode marked by delusions and paranoia, one Nebraska man explains: “I wanted to go someplace where I could be safe until I got healthy again.” Still, the prospect of handing over control to hospital staff can be scary. That’s why our story covers what to expect, how to prepare, and how to make the most of your stay.</p>\n<p>To drink or not to drink? That’s the question in “Sober Consideration.” The medical advice would be “not.” Yet many people look for that middle ground and answer “in moderation” or “only at parties.”</p>\n<p>Although it’s tempting to use alcohol to subdue feelings of anxiety and depression—known as “self-medicating”—that can backfire in the long run by worsening bipolar depression, increasing risk-taking in hypo/mania, and tipping the balance when it comes to acting on suicidal thoughts. Plus, research shows that having bipolar makes you especially susceptible to developing a drinking problem.</p>\n<p>Our story takes a candid look at how others have decided to deal with drinking—from abstaining completely to modifying their intake in light of their current mood symptoms.</p>\n<p>Coping with bipolar obviously isn’t funny business … but finding humor in it is a great defense, a way to take the edge off unpleasant experiences and regain control over recovery. Taking center stage in “On My Mind: Finding the Funny in Bipolar Depression” is bphope’s good friend, blogger and comedian Dave Mowry (pictured here). Dave admittedly takes a skewed view of the dark stretches when he barely showers, never cooks and retreats to his couch. His version: Bipolar depression is environmentally friendly! Sometimes laughter is the best medicine.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"byline\">Joanne M.

(“Impulse Power,” Spring 2017.) I have a real issue with impulsively spending money. Not unusual for an individual with bipolar! I don’t want to give my credit card to my husband because spending seems to be one of my coping devices. Nothing I have tried to control the impulse has worked. I appreciate the list of ideas I can utilize to mitigate some of the worse aspects of my impulsivity. I now possess a few more tools in my tool box.<br /><b>—Dixie</b> via bphope.com</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\nA VERY well-thought-out article. In dealing with impulse buying I have discovered a series of things that help me stay financially healthy while giving me the sense of satisfaction from shopping. I start with an empty basket, whether at T.J. Maxx, Target or the thrift store. I walk through the aisles looking at all the pretty, cool items, touching them, thinking about where they might look best. Then I park the basket in the last row and leave. Without anything. It is psychologically rewarding and financially responsible.<br /><b>—Sally</b> via bphope.com</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>\nWHAT TIMING! Just yesterday I found myself doubling the speed limit and passing across solid center lines, even though I was not in a rush. I was aware of impetuous behavior as a symptom of bipolar mania, but feel stable right now. I didn’t have anything to which I attributed the reckless driving, but I convinced myself it had nothing to do with the disorder. Having read this article, I’m not so sure. The thing I do know is that I must rein in my driving habits to avoid hurting someone.<br /><b>—Ettrick</b> via bphope.com</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>\nI HAVE SPENT at least three weeks wondering but thinking my last online shopping probably wasn’t hypomania. Now that I’ve read this article, I think maybe I really was hypomanic. I couldn’t sleep and got up and went shopping, buying three different perfumes I’d been wanting, spending more than $200. This article spells out what I was feeling and doing that night. By the way, I didn’t bankrupt myself, just have less in that account than I’d like.<br /><b>—Pink</b> via bphope.com</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>\nALWAYS NICE LEARNING something new about my illness. Thanks for a great article.<br /><b>—Name Withheld</b></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>\nI DON’T AGREE WITH the following statement by Michael E. Thase, MD, in this well-written article: “Just because it’s in the brain doesn’t mean it’s out of your control.” Bipolar II, rapid cycling, causes me to say things impulsively (telling someone off) and it has ruined many friendships. I do not believe that for me, in the moment, it is always in my control. Mood-stabilizing meds help a lot, but what has helped more is redirecting that mechanism. I became a volunteer that fights for a cause I believe in. Telling the government off is better than telling a friend off!<br /><b>—phoenix rising</b> via bphope.com</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>\nGREAT INFORMATION. Nice to know it’s not just me. I feel validated. I will try some of your suggestions to keep myself out of trouble.<br /><b>—Kimberlee</b> via bphope.com</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>\nI LOVE THE MAGAZINE and have often felt “supported” hearing from so many others who have dealt with and are dealing with similar challenges that accompany bipolarity. There is much written about mania-driven behaviors of gambling, drinking and shopping. But I feel that there is still an aversion to straightforward conversation about mania and sexual “side effects.” I feel that keeping this part of bipolar hidden, or more hushed than other discussed activities, doesn’t help remove the overall stigma of mental illness. Anything that contributes to the stigma keeps others from seeking needed treatment.<br /><b>—Name Withheld,</b> STAMFORD, CT</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_5441/storage/images/media2/images/bpspr17-parenting-spread/74823-1-eng-GB/bpspr17-parenting-spread.jpg\" width=\"1024\" height=\"612\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"bpSpr17-Parenting-Spread\" title=\"bpSpr17-Parenting-Spread\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h2>FAMILY AFFAIRS</h2><p>\nI WANT TO THANK the three families who shared their experiences in parenting (“Profiles in Parenting,” Spring 2017). Although every family’s story is different and we are all in unique situations, I love to hear what other people are doing to get through. I couldn’t talk about my own experiences for so long but I’ve always admired those who could and did. Most of the time, I can pull some nugget of insight and apply it to our situation. Despite, or due to, years of constant vigilance and adjustments my daughter seems to be on the road to stability as a young adult. I hope I’m brave enough to share our story someday as well.<br /><b>—Brooke,</b> NASHVILLE, TN</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\nAS THE SINGLE PARENT of a teen with bipolar, I’m curious why you only profiled two-parent, middle-class families in this article. There are many single-parent families and others who advocate for their children but do not have the resources of time and money these families have. We, too, could use some examples of proactive parenting.<br /><b>—Keri</b> via bphope.com</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>EXERCISE OBSTACLES</h2><p>\nTHANK YOU for the article “Action Plan” (Spring 2017). Exercise has been the bane of my existence for the past six years. The “roadblocks” you listed resonate with me, but none more so than No. 10: I feel too awful to exercise. I have days that I don’t even leave the house. I know that may sound familiar to someone with bipolar. If only I could take that one step! I will endeavor to try one of your well-thought-out ideas.<br /><b>—Dixie</b> via bphope.com</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>OPPOSING ISOLATION</h2><p>\nJULIE FAST’S COLUMN on bipolar disorder and isolation (“Ending Depression Isolation,” Spring 2017) is so intelligent, insightful and actionable!<br /><b>—Ken</b> via bphope.com</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>\nI ALSO HAVE FOUND that doing the opposite of what I am feeling helps me. Knowing that I have accomplished something, no matter how small, is satisfying. It prevents feelings of guilt over not having accomplished anything, which only fuels the worthless feelings and drives one deeper into depression. Doing the opposite of what I feel actually prevents the depression from progressing deeper or, at least, slows down the process. Thank you, Julie, for sharing your experience. You validated one of my coping skills and it’s good to know I’m not the only one who does this.<br /><b>—JourneyUpward</b> via bphope.com</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>\nMY THERAPIST SAYS I have to do what’s best for me (when I figure that out, as every situation is different and I have to weigh the pros and cons of a decision before I choose to commit to a social engagement). I no longer aim to please or to impress others. If I can’t go, I don’t—a simple no, with no explanation. If my anxiety is high I definitely stay home where it is safe.<br /><b>—S.F.</b> via bphope.com</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>\nWHAT IF DURING MY depressive states, I get a certain comfort and contentment from being in bed all day? It’s sort of a safe and comfortable escape from all that I fear and worry about with my life. Should I still be social and get out of that bed? Or ride it out?<br /><b>—E.C.</b> via bphope.com</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>MORE TO BE DONE</h2><p>\nI AGREE WITH Stephen Propst’s column “A Problematic Paradox” (Spring 2017). I think it is well known, at least by those who have a mental illness as well as those who work in the profession (I do both), that yes, we have as a society and government made progress [against stigma] since the 1950s and each decade since, but there is still more to be done. I’m not sure if education is the answer (some may not be interested), but I do think that by not advocating for ourselves we are only perpetuating the stigma. Where to go from here?<br /><b>—Katey</b> via bphope.com</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>\nAN EXCELLENT ARTICLE with significant truths about our society’s mental health stigma. Indeed, it needs fixing!<br /><b>—Meil</b> via bphope.com</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>\nCLOSE FAMILY KNOW I live with bipolar II, but the “general public” people I come in contact with on a fairly regular basis don’t know. My two employers don’t know and they are both psychiatrists. I don’t want to be viewed as having a mental illness. I think it’s private.<br /><b>—Judge</b> via bphope.com</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>\nTHANKS AS ALWAYS, STEVE, for your personal insight and the ability to put it into words. Your advocacy gives hope to many and helps those who struggle daily with the stigma of having a bipolar diagnosis.<br /><b>—Vilda</b> via bphope.com</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>RESPECTFUL RELATIONSHIPS</h2><p>\nI AM STILL LEARNING how to not overreact to anyone who is telling me what to do or how to do it. It gets pretty scary to hear myself react and feel angry. Your Ask the Doctor column on “Personal Boundaries” (Spring 2017) will certainly be one I will keep handy to read. Thank you for your compassion and love.<br /><b>—M</b> via bphope.com</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>BEYOND PRINT</h2><p>\nFOR 50 YEARS I have been trying to understand my behavior, behavior that I have always been told was abnormal. I have spent 30 years with the trial and error of psychiatry. I have only been following you on Facebook for a few months, but in those few months you have given me information to understand myself. Even in the last few weeks I have felt like I am coming alive again. Some of the things that I read have explained past behaviors that baffled me. Thank you for helping me understand myself.<br /><b>—C.A.</b> via bphope.com</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>\nI FOUND ‘BP MAGAZINE’ by chance last year and now receive your e-newsletters. I am getting so much information about my mental health condition which has helped me so much in my recovery.

However, private sector workers were more likely to say they felt supported after disclosing mental health problems.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><b>Philippines' mental health bill</b></h3><p>May 2, 2017, MANILA, Philippines—The Senate here unanimously approved a bill to establish a national mental health policy. The legislation would integrate behavioral health care into the public health system and require the government to provide mental health services at the community level and in public hospitals.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><b>Hong Kong lacks specialists</b></h3><p>April 27, 2017, HONG KONG, China—Hong Kong faces a severe shortage of psychiatrists in public hospitals and wait times to see a mental health expert range from nine months to three years. A government report noted increased demand for services, especially among children, the <i>Hong Kong Free Press</i> reports.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><b>Guyana targets suicide rate</b></h3><p>April 15, 2017, GEORGETOWN, Guyana—This South American country, which has the world’s highest suicide rate, announced plans for a national campaign tackling mental health issues. Experts cite deep poverty, alcohol abuse, easy access to deadly pesticides, and limited access to psychiatrists for the high rate of self-inflicted deaths.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>MLB player Jimmy Piersall was a pioneer in chronicling his bipolar disorder</h3><p>June 4, 2017, BOSTON, MA—Former pro baseball player Jim Piersall, who opened up about his struggles with bipolar disorder in his book <i>Fear Strikes Out</i>, has died. The 1955 memoir was later made into a movie starring Anthony Perkins and Karl Malden.</p>\n<p>Known for his on-field antics, Piersall returned to the majors after being admitted to a psychiatric facility. He went public about his struggles with manic depression, now known as bipolar disorder, to combat society’s stereotypes of mental disorders, the Associated Press reports.</p>\n<p>After his playing days, Piersall became a broadcaster. He was inducted into the Red Sox Hall of Fame in 2010.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Proposed bill directs US agency to tailor outreach for Asian-Americans</h3><p>June 1, 2017, WASHINGTON, DC —A bill introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives aims to reduce stubborn stigma that keeps Asian-Americans and Pacific Islanders suffering in silence.</p>\n<p>The bill would mandate the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration to reach out to those communities to raise awareness about behavioral health. According to the American Psychological Association, those population groups are three times less likely to seek mental health care than Americans of European descent, NBC News reports.</p>\n<p>Rep. Judy Chu of California, who introduced the bill, said language barriers and cultural beliefs contribute to lower rates of help-seeking. The “model minority” myth, which wrongly imagines that Asian-Americans don’t have the same problems as other groups, only makes it worse, she said.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Coalition looks at immigrants’ issues</h3><p>May 26, 2017, CHICAGO, IL—The Coalition for Immigrant Mental Health hosted its first summit to discuss psychological issues faced by individuals living in the United States without legal permission.</p>\n<p>Community leaders, representatives from public health agencies, elected officials and experts from Chicago-area universities touched on issues like chronic stress related to uncertain immigration status and the federal government’s pressure on “sanctuary cities.”</p>\n<p>U.S. Sen. Dick Durbin talked about “emotional turmoil” due to increased anti-immigration sentiment in the wake of last year’s presidential election.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>New Colorado law ends jailing during mental health holds</h3><p>May 18, 2017, DENVER, CO—Gov. John Hickenlooper signed into law new legislation that will ban putting people in jail when they are picked up on mental health holds, the <i>Denver Post</i> reports.</p>\n<p>Colorado had been one of just six states that permitted placing people behind bars when they are having mental health episodes or are suicidal, but have not committed any crime.</p>\n<p>The new legislation also increases funding for walk-in mental health centers and a network of crisis-response teams, as well as transportation to treatment in rural areas.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Exhibit at Boston’s Museum of Science aims to change attitudes about living with bipolar</h3><p>May 27, 2017, BOSTON, MA—The Museum of Science in this New England capital opened an exhibit intended to dispel misconceptions about brain-based disorders, the <i>Newburyport News</i> reports.</p>\n<p>Titled “Many Faces of Our Mental Health,” the exhibit features artworks inspired by current research. One sculpture represents the full human DNA sequence. A display of 99 photographs challenges viewers to tell who has bipolar disorder, who has schizophrenia, and who is a family member with no diagnosis.</p>\n<p>“This is not to say [a serious mental illness] goes away, and not to say it’s not an enormous challenge, but success is out there and … I wanted to show the hope,” said Lynda Michaud Cutrell, who pulled the exhibit together with assistance from the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) Cape Ann.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_5441/storage/images/media2/images/sunovion-influencer-summit/74837-1-eng-GB/sunovion-influencer-summit.jpg\" width=\"1024\" height=\"664\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"sunovion-influencer-summit\" title=\"sunovion-influencer-summit\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p>Mental health bloggers (including many from bphope.com) and Sunovion staffers who met to brainstorm ways to support the bipolar community, pictured at the Sparks Gallery in San Diego, California.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3>Sunovion Hosts Mental Health Influencer Summit</h3><p>May 21, 2017, SAN DIEGO, CA—Sunovion Pharmaceuticals Inc. sponsored their 2nd Annual Mental Health Influencer Summit in May. Under the theme of courage and commitment, the event united top online influencers to discuss ways to advance mental health together. Keynote speaker Jennifer Marshall, co-founder of <i>This Is My Brave</i>, tied the mission of the grassroots organization to the day’s objective and showcased how the power of storytelling can build a sense of community, helping people receive the treatment and support they need to live well. Fellow keynote Robert Goldman, MD, head of Global Clinical Research &amp; Medical Affairs at Sunovion, underscored the importance of continued mental health research, revealing how new innovations can further lead to hope for the future.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Mounties in Alberta required to take resiliency training</h3><p>April 30, 2017, SPRUCE GROVE, AB—The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) division in Alberta is using a program called the Road to Mental Readiness (R2MR) in an effort to prevent post-traumatic stress disorder and other mental health issues, the <i>Spruce Grove Examiner</i> reports.</p>\n<p>The program, which is mandatory in the RCMP’s K Division, provides information on the short-term and long-term effects of trauma, teaches self-management strategies and resiliency skills, and directs those in need to additional resources.</p>\n<p>It’s also an effort to challenge stigma in what can be a very stressful work environment. Const. Shelley Nasheim said officers are often hesitant to admit they need help out of fear they’ll be viewed as weak, unable to do their work, or “faking it.” The R2MR workshop “gives us permission to come forward and deal with it, because not dealing with it is causing nothing but harm,” Nasheim said.</p>\n","layout":{},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":1,"link_source":"","competition":[],"flatplan_title":"","notes":"","gutter_credit":"","other":"","image":[{"id":"a2864377ab7ca0c7c79c704da4908d14","name":"newsline","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_5441/storage/images/media2/images/newsline5/74830-1-eng-GB/newsline.jpg?t=default_ipad_portrait&ext/newsline_default_ipad_portrait.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"768","height":"215","legacy_id":"4600","is_default":true},{"id":"a2864377ab7ca0c7c79c704da4908d14","name":"newsline","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_5441/storage/images/media2/images/newsline5/74830-1-eng-GB/newsline.jpg?t=default_ipad_landscape&ext/newsline_default_ipad_landscape.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"1024","height":"287","legacy_id":"4600","is_default":false}],"related_objects":{"image":[{"id":"a6126248a646214c6e320c73aa24fd70","name":"sunovion-influencer-summit","source":"","caption":"<p>Mental health bloggers (including many from bphope.com) and Sunovion staffers who met to brainstorm ways to support the bipolar community, pictured at the Sparks Gallery in San Diego, California.</p>\n","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_5441/storage/images/media2/images/sunovion-influencer-summit/74837-1-eng-GB/sunovion-influencer-summit.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"1024","height":"664","legacy_id":"4601"},{"id":"a6126248a646214c6e320c73aa24fd70","name":"sunovion-influencer-summit","source":"","caption":"<p>Mental health bloggers (including many from bphope.com) and Sunovion staffers who met to brainstorm ways to support the bipolar community, pictured at the Sparks Gallery in San Diego, California.</p>\n","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_5441/storage/images/media2/images/sunovion-influencer-summit/74837-1-eng-GB/sunovion-influencer-summit.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"1024","height":"664","legacy_id":"4601"}]},"url_alias":"http://bpmagazine.audiencemedia.com","type":"story","order":"4","folio_number":"8","folio_numbers":"8,9","pdf_page_index":"8","thumbnail":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_5441/storage/images/media2/images/newsline5/74830-1-eng-GB/newsline.jpg?t=tablet_story_thumbnail&ext/newsline_tablet_story_thumbnail.jpg","color":"FFFFFF","real_id":"4498","main_section_id":"191","ads":[]},{"id":"zinio_22_bpmagus170601_article_010_01_1498212092.9375","title":"New Research In Mental Health","sub_title":"","author":[{"id":"0","name":"","email":"noreply@audiencemedia.com","is_default":false}],"tag":"","strap_line":"IN EVERY ISSUE","intro":"","body":"<h3>Identifying major factors in workplace impairment</h3><p>June 1, 2017, ANN ARBOR, MI—A lengthy study of how bipolar disorder affects functioning in employment highlights the damaging impact of bipolar depression and cognitive impairments.</p>\n<p>American researchers followed more than 270 adults with diagnoses on the bipolar spectrum over five years to study work attendance, conflict, enjoyment, and performance in the workplace.</p>\n<p>The study found people with higher levels of depression and greater deficits in cognitive flexibility (the ability to switch between modes of thought and consider multiple concepts at once) were more likely to have poorer work attendance, lower quality of work, and reduced satisfaction from work.</p>\n<p>(Turn to our story “What to Say at Work—and When” on page 22 for how to handle bipolar-related issues with job performance.)</p>\n<p>The researchers said their findings show the need for interventions that focus on treating depressive symptoms and neurocognitive deficits so people with bipolar can live more productive, satisfying and financially secure lives.</p>\n<p>The study, which appeared in the <i>Journal of Affective Disorders</i>, was entitled “Depression and executive functioning deficits predict poor occupational functioning in a large longitudinal sample with bipolar disorder.”</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Aggression delays bipolar depression</h3><p>May 1, 2017, PHILADELPHIA, PA—Aggression appears to keep the depressive phase of bipolar disorder at bay longer, a new study suggests.</p>\n<p>American researchers noted a growing body of evidence that suggests bipolar disorder is associated with higher levels of aggressive behavior. They looked at about 120 young adults, checking in every four months for more than three years.</p>\n<p>The team found that, overall, physical and verbal aggression predicted a longer time to major depressive episode onset even after controlling for depressive and manic symptoms at the start of the study, family history of mood disorder, treatment seeking for mood problems, and impulsivity.</p>\n<p>Aggression did not, however, significantly predict the time to manic episodes.</p>\n<p>The study, which appeared in the journal <i>Behavior Therapy</i>, was entitled “Aggression protects against the onset of major depressive episodes in individuals with bipolar spectrum disorder.”</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Sleep apnea linked with bipolar disorder</h3><p>May 1, 2017, TAINAN, Taiwan—Sleep apnea, or frequent halts in breathing while asleep, has been linked with bipolar disorder in a new study.</p>\n<p>Taiwanese researchers looked at more than 5,000 people with sleep apnea and more than 27,000 people who did not have the condition. They found that people with sleep apnea were two to three times more likely to get a bipolar disorder diagnosis as compared to people without sleep apnea.</p>\n<p>The authors said their findings indicate that health professionals should carefully monitor the psychological health of individuals with sleep apnea.</p>\n<p>The study, which appeared in the journal <i>Sleep and Breathing</i>, was entitled “Sleep apnea is associated with an increased risk of mood disorders: A population-based cohort study.”</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Support from peer specialist has strong impact on self-efficacy</h3><p>May 1, 2017, HAMBURG, Germany—One-to-one peer support appears beneficial for people with bipolar disorder in terms of improving their confidence about being able to complete tasks and reach goals, a new study suggests.</p>\n<p>German researchers looked at people with bipolar and other psychiatric disorders who received one-to-one peer support from trained peer specialists along with treatment as usual over six months, and compared them with people who had only treatment as usual.</p>\n<p>Six months after the study, those receiving one-to-one peer support had significantly higher self-efficacy, a term that refers to believing in your own ability to exercise control over your behavior and social environment.</p>\n<p>The study, which appeared in the journal <i>European Psychiatry</i>, was entitled “Effectiveness of one-to-one peer support for patients with severe mental illness — a randomised controlled trial.”</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Enhanced treatment gets better results in medication adherence, other measures</h3><p>April 27, 2017, QAZVIN, Iran—Motivational interviewing and psychoeducation can help boost medication adherence in people with bipolar disorder, a new study suggests.</p>\n<p>A team of Iranian, American, Chinese and British researchers compared the impact of combining those add-on treatments with usual care at 10 academic centers. In motivational interviewing, a psychotherapist guides the client toward behavioral change by helping to clarify goals and address barriers. Psychoeducation refers to providing information that increases understanding about the illness and coping strategies.</p>\n<p>Compared to people who received treatment as usual only, participants in the enhanced treatment group demonstrated a greater increase in medication adherence, as well as greater improvements in clinical symptoms, quality of life, coping planning, and several other measures.</p>\n<p>The study, which appeared in the journal <i>Psychological Medicine</i> online ahead of print, was entitled “Promoting medication adherence among patients with bipolar disorder: A multicenter randomized controlled trial of a multifaceted intervention.”</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Rates of metabolic syndrome twice as high among younger adults with bipolar disorder</h3><p>April 2, 2017, PELOTAS, Brazil—Young adults experiencing bipolar depression have significantly higher rates of metabolic syndrome symptoms than their peers without a psychiatric diagnosis, a new study has found.</p>\n<p>Researchers with Brazilian and Canadian credentials looked at nearly 1,000 people ages 24 to 30 to analyze the cluster of risk factors constituting metabolic syndrome, including levels of blood glucose and cholesterol. People with metabolic syndrome are on a path to develop chronic health problems such as diabetes and heart disease.</p>\n<p>While 22 percent of people without a mood disorder had metabolic syndrome, nearly 47 percent of those with bipolar had the condition. Individuals with a mood disorder were also more likely to have a higher body mass index than the general population.</p>\n<p>The study, which appeared in the <i>Journal of Psychiatric Research</i> online ahead of print, was entitled “Metabolic syndrome in subjects with bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder in a current depressive episode: Population-based study.”</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Mindfulness therapy has lasting benefits</h3><p>April 14, 2017, GENEVA, Switzerland—Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) appears to have lasting benefits for people with bipolar disorder, a new study suggests.</p>\n<p>Swiss and French researchers looked at the impact of MBCT on people with bipolar I or II who underwent at least four sessions. They surveyed participants two years after the training and found that incorporating mindfulness practices and mindful breathing into daily life on a regular basis was associated with better prevention of depressive relapse.</p>\n<p>The study, which appeared in the <i>Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine</i> online ahead of print, was entitled “Self-reported long-term benefits of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy in patients with bipolar disorder.”</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Common for anxiety to occur separately from mood episodes</h3><p>April 1, 2017, HALIFAX, NS—Anxious symptoms are highly common in people with bipolar disorder even when bipolar symptoms are in remission, a new study suggests.</p>\n<p>Canadian, American, Australian and Finnish researchers analyzed 10 studies involving thousands of people and found that among individuals with bipolar who were not experiencing a current mood shift, a third met the diagnostic criteria for one or more anxiety disorders.</p>\n<p>Compared to the general population, people with bipolar were nearly five times more likely to have an anxiety disorder.</p>\n<p>The authors said that people with bipolar should be routinely assessed for anxiety disorders in order to start treatment targeting anxiety if necessary.</p>\n<p>The study, which appeared in the journal <i>Psychological Medicine</i>, was entitled “Prevalence of current anxiety disorders in people with bipolar disorder during euthymia: A meta-analysis.”</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Euthymic children with bipolar display deficits in memory, learning but not problem-solving</h3><p>April 1, 2017, FORTALEZA, Brazil—Children with bipolar disorder appear to have significant cognitive deficits that affect learning and memory, a new study suggests.</p>\n<p>Brazilian, British, Australian, Canadian, Spanish and Danish researchers conducted an analysis of dozens of studies to find data on euthymic children with bipolar (not currently in either an elevated or depressed state). Compared to kids without bipolar, they demonstrated moderate to large impairments in verbal learning, verbal memory, working memory, visual learning, and visual memory.</p>\n<p>Concentration, problem-solving, and processing speed (how long it takes to act on information in order to perform a task) were not markedly different in the children with bipolar.</p>\n<p>The study, which appeared in the <i>Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry</i>, was entitled “Cognitive impairment in euthymic pediatric bipolar disorder: A systematic review and meta-analysis.”</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Poor response to lithium treatment linked to childhood physical abuse</h3><p>April 1, 2017, PARIS, France—Surviving physical abuse as a child appears to make people with bipolar disorder less likely to respond to treatment with lithium later in life, a new study suggests.</p>\n<p>French and British researchers looked at almost 150 people with bipolar currently in a stable mood. They found about 20 percent responded excellently to lithium and about half were partial responders. The other 30 percent showed no response.</p>\n<p>The study found that a higher level of childhood physical abuse significantly correlated with a lower level of response to lithium. In addition, a history of mixed bipolar episodes was independently associated with poor response to lithium.</p>\n<p>The study, which appeared in the journal <i>Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica</i>, was entitled “Childhood trauma and mixed episodes are associated with poor response to lithium in bipolar disorders.”</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Higher mortality with bipolar seen even in a country with universal health care</h3><p>April 1, 2017, TEL AVIV, Israel—Mortality rates for people with bipolar disorder are higher than the general public even in a country with health care coverage for all, a new study suggests.</p>\n<p>Researchers in Israel, which has universal health care, compared people with and without bipolar disorder. They found those with bipolar accessed health services such as lab tests, visits to specialists, and medications as much as the comparison group, yet their mortality risk was 1.7 times greater.</p>\n<p>Results were similar for a subgroup of people with bipolar and co-morbid diabetes.</p>\n<p>The study, which appeared in the <i>Canadian Journal of Psychiatry</i>, was entitled “Health care and mortality among persons with severe mental illness.”</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Different risk factors for men, women to get mania after antidepressant use</h3><p>April 1, 2017, NEWCASTLE UPON TYNE, United Kingdom—European researchers say that for the first time, they’ve been able to identify gender differences in the risk factors for developing mania after stand-alone antidepressant treatment.</p>\n<p>Among men with bipolar disorder, the strongest risk factors were a history of one or more suicide attempts, higher number of depressive episodes per year of illness, and the presence of an alcohol and/or substance abuse disorder.</p>\n<p>Among women with bipolar, risk factors included a positive history of thyroid disorder, a positive family history of bipolar I disorder, and depressive onset of bipolar illness.</p>\n<p>The study, which appeared in the journal <i>Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica</i> online ahead of print, was entitled “A re-examination of antidepressant treatment-emergent mania in bipolar disorders: Evidence of gender differences.”</p>\n","layout":{},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":1,"link_source":"","competition":[],"flatplan_title":"","notes":"","gutter_credit":"","other":"","image":[{"id":"47ebd62c809b7eaa2a5217f386e6f630","name":"researchline","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_5441/storage/images/media2/images/researchline5/74844-1-eng-GB/researchline.jpg?t=default_ipad_portrait&ext/researchline_default_ipad_portrait.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"768","height":"215","legacy_id":"4602","is_default":true},{"id":"47ebd62c809b7eaa2a5217f386e6f630","name":"researchline","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_5441/storage/images/media2/images/researchline5/74844-1-eng-GB/researchline.jpg?t=default_ipad_landscape&ext/researchline_default_ipad_landscape.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"1024","height":"287","legacy_id":"4602","is_default":false}],"url_alias":"http://bpmagazine.audiencemedia.com","type":"story","order":"6","folio_number":"10","folio_numbers":"10,11,12","pdf_page_index":"10","thumbnail":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_5441/storage/images/media2/images/researchline5/74844-1-eng-GB/researchline.jpg?t=tablet_story_thumbnail&ext/researchline_tablet_story_thumbnail.jpg","color":"FFFFFF","real_id":"4504","main_section_id":"191","ads":[]},{"id":"zinio_22_bpmagus170601_article_042_01_1498212116.8025","title":"Tips For Balanced Living","sub_title":"","author":[{"id":"0","name":"","email":"noreply@audiencemedia.com","is_default":false}],"tag":"","strap_line":"IN EVERY ISSUE","intro":"","body":"\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_5441/storage/images/media2/images/woman-sunlight-reading/74858-1-eng-GB/woman-sunlight-reading.jpg\" width=\"1024\" height=\"592\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"woman-sunlight-reading\" title=\"woman-sunlight-reading\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h2><b>D - fense</b></h2><p><b>With summer here, it’s a great time to get your daily dose of Vitamin D from the sun.</b></p>\n<p>But how much ray time do you need to meet your “D” needs?
