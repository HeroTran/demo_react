It’s cost me relationships, jobs, and other opportunities. I know people who are in prison instead of a treatment center because they were too ashamed to admit they had bipolar disorder. I’ve known even more who died by suicide because they shied away from getting help.</p>\n<p>Ending stigma won’t take place overnight, but it must be dealt with head-on. The costs of ignoring it are too high. I try to combat stigma in at least four areas:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>MISINFORMATION.</b> Stigma results when a certain group of people is labeled as tainted or less worthy simply because they possess a particular characteristic.</p>\n<p>Despite research showing the biological nature of bipolar, society is still too intolerant of people with a psychiatric diagnosis. Such ignorance can lead to an unwillingness to work with, socialize with, or live next door to someone who has bipolar.</p>\n<p>I try to use my own story to enlighten others in everyday encounters. To the extent that you feel comfortable, confront others with the facts. If you choose to disclose your diagnosis, be matter-of-fact about your typical symptoms and emphasize the strategies that help you stay in balance. Write a letter to the editor of your local paper, or take part in a public awareness event. Learn more about efforts like NAMI’s stigma-free campaign: <a href=\"http://www.nami.org/stigmafree\" target=\"_self\">www.nami.</a><a href=\"http://www.nami.org/stigmafree\" target=\"_self\">org/stigmafree</a>.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>MISPERCEPTION.</b> Those of us living with a mood disorder know what it’s like to have people avoid us or use demeaning language about us (“He’s nuts, you know”). I’ve had acquaintances distance themselves from me rather than deal with my bipolar idiosyncrasies.</p>\n<p>People may even belittle the truth of what we’re living with. A family friend once told me I was “too smart to have bipolar.” Hearing that made me feel like I was stupid, as if I must have made up my diagnosis.</p>\n<p>We’ve all heard people say things like, “Bipolar disorder is all in your head.” In reality, such myths are in <i>their</i> heads, and we must all do what we can to change their perceptions by letting them know that bipolar is a treatable medical condition. Otherwise, they will continue to believe the falsehoods and perpetuate stigma.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>DEHUMANIZATION.</b> When you reduce someone to a diagnosis, you invalidate him or her as a singular human being. Sometimes we do that to ourselves. In the support groups I lead, a person might introduce herself and say, “I’m bipolar.” I’ll correct her and say, “No, you <i>have</i> bipolar.” It’s an important distinction: <i>having bipolar does not define who you are.</i></p>\n<p>I’ve learned not to dwell too much on the fact that I have this chronic condition. I try to let people see what else defines me —like my sense of humor! When you give others a glimpse of what makes you special, you give them less of a chance of seeing you as nothing more than a set of symptoms.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>DISCRIMINATION.</b> Years ago, I was director of quality control for a major organization. Shortly after getting a 95 percent approval rating for a company-wide seminar I presented, I was terminated—there was “just something not quite right” about me. I didn’t pursue the matter legally because an attorney advised me it would be overly taxing.</p>\n<p>Today, I might be more willing to take the case to court—I admire others who do just that. At a minimum, I would seek out employers who are sensitive to mental health issues and are willing to offer reasonable accommodation.</p>\n<p>Even though it can feel overwhelming, don’t let fear stop you from stopping stigma. Educate yourself and others about the true nature of brain-based illnesses like bipolar. Stigma may be a formidable force, but we can and must confront it and one day (hopefully) eradicate it altogether!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<i>-----</i><br /><i>Stephen Propst is an advocate, writer, public speaker, and coach/consultant focusing on living successfully with conditions like bipolar.

I’m neither proud nor ashamed to admit it. It is simply a fact: I am not the athletic type. I am, however, the organized type. I recognize the power and enjoy the process of creating and perfecting a plan, sticking to it, and recruiting qualified individuals to assist in implementing that plan.</p>\n<p>In short, while I’ve never worn a jersey with my name on the back, I do recognize the power of teamwork. That said, I haven’t always been the best at it. Given the option of doing a group or solo homework assignment in school, I nearly always chose the latter.</p>\n<p>I prefer to work alone and, as a writer, most of the time I do. But I’ve never worked <i>entirely</i> alone, because I can’t. None of us can—at least not if we expect to be successful. I’ve worked with many people throughout my career—agents, editors, publishers, producers, and others—and were it not for them, I wouldn’t <i>have</i> a career.</p>\n<p>In many ways, recovery is its own profession, and it requires just as much diligence, resilience, and teamwork as any worthwhile career path. At certain times in my life, recovery has had to become my full-time job. Some people label such stints with terms like “unemployment” and “disability,” but for those of us living with serious psychiatric conditions like bipolar disorder, we know that recovery can be the toughest job in the world. And despite the fact that no one is handing us degrees or stacks of cash, we deserve some credit for it.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                    <a href=https://ad.doubleclick.net/ddm/clk/303209565;130320553;q?http://www.bipolardepressionoptions.com?utm_medium=Display&amp;utm_source=Display&amp;utm_campaign=Latuda_DTC_Unbranded_Static&amp;utm_term=Display&amp;utm_content=LAT_LAT630-14&amp;http://www.latuda.com target=\"_self\">        <img src=\"/var/site_5441/storage/images/media2/images/advertisement15/74970-1-eng-GB/advertisement.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"297\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"advertisement\" title=\"advertisement\" />\n        </a>\t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>I have worked harder at my recovery than I ever did in law school and graduate school combined. Over the years, I’ve worked as a restaurant server, jewelry store clerk, barista, fudge confectioner, gift shop attendant, estate lawyer, and now, writer. While each of these positions has presented its own unique challenges, not one of them has been half as challenging as my recovery.</p>\n<p>And the single factor most responsible for helping me evolve from full-time recovery to full-time writing to full-time <i>living</i> again hasn’t been my personal perseverance or my personal anything—it has been my <i>team</i>.</p>\n<p>Soon after being diagnosed with bipolar I, I learned that recovery is absolutely a team sport. Not only do you need to recruit the best players, but you need to train them.</p>\n<p>The only exception to that rule for me was my number-one overall draft pick, Who was already in the know about everything—Omniscient, in fact—and fully trained on all matters. Most Gracious and Most Merciful, the Creator is the glue that holds my team together. And thank God for good psychiatrists, because I finally found one of those as well.</p>\n<p>After years of scouting in two separate states, I recruited a top-notch psychiatrist I trust, who does—and <i>prefers</i> to do—psychotherapy in conjunction with medication management. While he was exquisitely trained when it came to psychiatry, he had no training when it came to me. That took time. But working together, we’ve formed a partnership, and it works. He is my star offensive player.</p>\n<p>Unlike my psychiatrist, my husband had already been recruited to my team long before I was finally diagnosed with bipolar. While he was exquisitely trained when it came to me, he had no training when it came to psychiatry. Thankfully, he is an avid reader and an attentive partner, and as a result, he has become and remains my first line of defense with respect to spotting the initial signs of mania or depression. He is my star defensive player.</p>\n<p>The rest of my team is made up of my parents, my sister, about a dozen tried-and-true friends, and two cats. They all play different roles in my recovery, but they are all part of my team, and they know it (with the exception of the cats, of course, though I suspect they know more than they let on).</p>\n<p>Recognizing that I have this treasured team ready to step into action whenever necessary—and that I don’t need to train or educate any of them mid-game—gives me an enormous sense of relief and a newfound appreciation for teamwork.</p>\n<p>I would walk through fire for my team, but thanks to them, I don’t have to.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<i>-----</i><br /><i>Melody Moezzi is a writer, attorney, activist, speaker, and award-winning author, most recently of</i> Haldol and Hyacinths: A Bipolar Life<i>.

Fast</p>\n<p>Do you feel abandoned by people when you get depressed? I do. This is a common symptom of bipolar depression and one that if left untreated can lead to the loss of relationships—relationships we desperately need for our stability.</p>\n<p>When I’m in an abandonment downswing, I think, <i>“I am a worthless ant, a speck of dirt on this huge revolving planet. I’m completely alone!”</i> The idea that I’m the last person on earth and no one loves me is a typical depression symptom. It’s not personal, and it’s not true. It’s a sign that I’m depressed.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><b>3 Signs of Abandonment Depression</b></h3><p>1. You do have people who want to help, but you ignore their words and actions. You feel like even pets don’t want your company.</p>\n<p>2. The abandonment feeling encompasses home, work, and the world in general. You feel that <i>everyone</i> and <i>everything</i> is leaving you.</p>\n<p>3. The abandonment feelings are not attached to an event. Events (triggers) can exacerbate your feelings of abandonment, but you will <i>not</i> be able to find proof that abandonment is actually happening.</p>\n<p>Did you know it’s normal to feel abandoned when you have bipolar depression? Just like it’s normal to feel shaky if you have diabetes and your insulin is low. We have an illness, not a personal problem.</p>\n<p>The good news is that symptoms can be managed. There is nothing wrong with your life when you feel abandoned while depressed; there is something in your brain that needs to be treated. When you manage your depression, the feelings of abandonment can go away. Honest.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><b>Here are my typical abandonment depression thoughts:</b></h3><p>• No one is calling me.</p>\n<p>• My friends are too busy for me.</p>\n<p>• My nephew is growing up and doesn’t want to be with me anymore.</p>\n<p>• There is something about me that people don’t like.</p>\n<p>• No one else has problems like this.</p>\n<p>• Why are all of my friends so much happier than I am?</p>\n<p>• What is wrong with me?!?</p>\n<p>See how this <i>cascades</i>? It can be especially tough at night when I try to sleep or I wake up too early and can’t get back to sleep.</p>\n<p>If you love someone with bipolar disorder who gets these abandonment symptoms when depressed, what can you say?</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><b>Here is a script to get you started:</b></h3><p><i>I hear that you feel lonely and that no one wants to be with you. I have heard this in the past when you’re depressed. I looked at the actual events around you and realized that you are not able to answer your phone or say yes to things because your brain is off track. Let’s talk about your depression and get you back into the life you care about; I know your feelings of being alone in this world will lift as well. They are a symptom of this rotten illness. How do I know this? Because I’m standing next to you and I’m not going anywhere, no matter what.</i></p>\n<p>I asked Martin Baker—the coauthor along with Fran Houston (who has bipolar disorder) of the book <i>High Tide, Low Tide: The Caring Friend’s Guide to Bipolar Disorder—how</i> a friend can help someone through an abandonment episode. His reply: “Julie, I recognize the internal dialogues you’ve listed (‘No one is calling,’ etc); I have heard them from Fran many times. My response is not to bombard her with contradictory assertions: ‘Of course they like you!’ ‘You are imagining it.’ ‘There’s nothing wrong with you—you are a fun, lovely person; anyone would be proud to be your friend!’ That kind of talking doesn’t honor what Fran is actually feeling. A better response is to simply <i>be there</i>. Be the person who <i>does</i> call. Be the person who <i>isn’t</i> too busy. Be the person who <i>demonstrates</i> (not merely <i>says</i>) that you are likable, and liked.”</p>\n<p>What about you? Having a plan in place to counteract these feelings of abandonment is my best advice for maintaining relationships when you have bipolar depression. I have learned to recognize my abandonment symptoms. My first rule for getting through an abandonment episode is not hiding in my bedroom. And I force myself to pick up the phone when it rings, or answer that email from a friend. It is so hard, but it works. You can do it!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<i>-----</i><br /><i>Julie A.

McInnis, MD, FRCPsych</p>\n<p>The preoccupation many of us have with national politics these days is overwhelming. Many people are checking news and social media feeds on the hour and continually engaging in discussions that are fraught with strife and despair over the environment, national security, and the future of health care. Never in modern history has the nation been so polarized in its political views, with each side equally convinced of its virtue.</p>\n<p>An individual with bipolar disorder—who often has intrinsically unstable moods to begin with—can find it very challenging to deal with the constant stimuli from the news, interpersonal tensions, and anxiety about the future.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><b>Everyone I know—family, friends, coworkers—is so riled up about politics. How can we coexist in peace when we don’t see eye to eye?</b></h2><p>More than ever before, my patients are finding themselves in uncomfortable situations wherein political disagreements lead to fierce arguments that primarily serve to upset everyone and lead to disrupted sleep, unstable moods, and unhelpful behaviors (e.g., substance abuse, fights).</p>\n<p>Best is to stay out of circular and toxic confrontations. Prepare a sentence to use when the temperature of the conversation goes up, such as “This is not a good time to talk about this,” or “This is an important issue—but we need to focus on xyz now.”</p>\n<p>Avoid senseless arguments with people who are entrenched in their ideas. You will not change anyone’s mind, nor are they likely to change yours.</p>\n<p>When you get upset, it is important to implement your “go-to” activity to calm down. Listen to a favorite song, go to yoga class, or do whatever it is that gives you peace. If you do not have a “go-to” activity, talk with a confidante or health-care specialist to develop one (or more). Avoid alcohol and other addictive behaviors.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><b>How can I manage my stress over the current political situation?</b></h2><p>In response to potential threats to mood stability, a standard routine needs to be in place that includes medication checks (are blood levels OK?) and a review of personal health practices (sleep, appetite, exercise).</p>\n<p>But meds and personal health practices alone cannot stop the bombardment of news and the addiction to checking social media that cause turmoil. I would recommend giving the techniques of mindfulness your full attention.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><b>What is “mindfulness,” and how can it help?</b></h2><p>Mindfulness is the state of active and open attention to the present, acknowledging and experiencing one’s own feelings: “I feel angry” or “I feel happy.” When one is mindful of emotional states, one is able to be an observer of one’s own state, identify the specific state, and determine an appropriate intervention, if needed. For example, when you are aware that an unpleasant experience is causing you distress, you can decide to go for a walk, play tennis, or read a book from your favorite genre. The key is to be able to <i>identify</i> the internal emotion and <i>implement</i> the intervention.</p>\n<p>There are mindfulness programs at many wellness centers. Call around and find out what’s available where you live.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><b>Can you recommend some reading on mindfulness?</b></h2><p>There are many books written on mindfulness and related techniques. Your library can help you in selecting something in the genre of self-help. Start with something easy; for example, <i>Wherever You Go, There You Are,</i> by Jon Kabat-Zinn, one of the major advocates of mindfulness. Another favorite of mine—a few years ago I gave a copy to everyone on my staff!—is <i>The Four Agreements</i>, by Don Miguel Ruiz, a modern book about an ancestral philosophy and ancient wisdom that offers helpful and simple guidelines for living that have long inspired me.</p>\n<p>These are stressful times, to be sure. But as Julian of Norwich wrote in the fourteenth century, “All shall be well, and all shall be well, and all manner of thing shall be well.”</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n-----<br /><b>Melvin G.

Since there is no actual way to change the past, nor does it seem likely there will be an ultimate cure in the future, I must learn how to adjust to the disorder so it won’t consume me. At times I have to dance with the devil to truly regain control of myself, and such a dance is exhausting.</p>\n<p><i>I’d say at present my dance with the devil is at a somewhat lingering interlude. These so-called interludes in our dances often evoke depression more than any glimmer of long-term stability and, worse, a sense of being incomplete without the false feelings of elation and security that usually follow my mania in the heights of our days-long dances.</i></p>\n<p>How, then, does this interlude differ from the ones before? How can I utilize this time of separation to better prepare myself for the dances that are surely yet to come?</p>\n<p>I come to it with new eyes set on understanding the present and planning for the future rather than languishing in the fictitious glory of the past. Although many would argue I am still in the first chapters of my life with much to look forward to and much to live for, I understand that I will always be living alongside my bipolar—and I project the only way to live robustly in spite of it is to know exactly how it operates within me.</p>\n<p><i>I know that mental illness touches each person uniquely. In many ways, you must be the master teacher of your dance to ever gain control over its intermittent appearances in your life.</i></p>\n<p>Of course the right combination of medication can help greatly in subduing the ravages of a manic or depressive episode, but it certainly does not cure bipolar in and of itself; it only affords an opportunity of clarity where one can begin to adjust to the realities of living with a chronic condition. Having experienced the effects of mania even while medicated has convinced me that medication alone does not always guarantee that an episode won’t manifest itself once again.</p>\n<p>The intervals during which I am more or less continually stable can last for months and years, yet there seems to be a climbing apex during the times of stability, as if every stressor I have is subconsciously banked into my psyche, building over time until the accumulated effects become unmanageable.</p>\n<p><i>Even if the stress was processed properly during the instance it occurred, it’s as if the process of processing any emotion adds fuel to the fire of my illness, as if there is a limited amount of time or experiences I can have until the next unexpected flare-up comes and my dance with the devil begins again.</i></p>\n<p>As I progress in my understanding of the condition and how it affects me, I have found it necessary to truly learn to live alongside it: even in instances of its presumed absence, I must always be aware that its influences still persist in one way or another.</p>\n<p><i>I guess the point is not to attempt to destroy the illness but rather to come to know how it is a part of me without letting it dictate the steps of the dance.</i></p>\n<p>It is tempting to want to forget the existence of one’s bipolar disorder during the times in which it appears to be managed and under control, yet it is at these very times that it must not be forgotten but rather remembered and understood through self-reflection. I would dare say those of us living alongside bipolar disorder are touched in a way that causes us to feel the extremes of beauty and pain to an unmanageable level; the diagnosis at some point must be embraced as an integral piece of our personality before it can be mastered. We must learn to dance with the devil that is our illness if we are ever to find the possibility of the positive to emerge from the struggle.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<i>-----</i><br /><i>Madeline Jaekle is a writer, mental health advocate, and public speaker who is currently working on a memoir about her experiences living with bipolar disorder.

Who knew?</p>\n<p>This idea came to me after I read a couple of news stories that said most Americans are showering way too often. Apparently we should only shower once a week. More than that and we are wasting water, not to mention washing essential oils off our bodies and out of our hair.</p>\n<p>That made me laugh and think, “Wow! With my bipolar depression, I am way ahead of this trend.” Not everyone will appreciate the humor, but it gave me a whole new way of looking at myself.</p>\n<p>When I get depressed, taking a shower is one of the first things to go. Once a week? Heck, how about once a month? Think of how much water, soap and energy I save.</p>\n<p>I also save on other grooming products. I have no need for hair gel and use very little deodorant. (Toothpaste is a must, however, even at my lowest.)</p>\n<p>I didn’t realize how eco-friendly I am thanks to my severe depressive episodes. And not just because I’m not taking showers.</p>\n<p>When I am depressed, I wear the same clothes day after day. Sometimes I sleep in my clothes because it is easier than taking them off and putting them back on. Smart, right?</p>\n\n<div class=\"object-center\">\t\t\n\n    \n                <div class=\"imagecenter\">\n    \n    \n                                                                                                                                    <a href=https://ad.doubleclick.net/ddm/clk/303209565;130320553;q?http://www.bipolardepressionoptions.com?utm_medium=Display&amp;utm_source=Display&amp;utm_campaign=Latuda_DTC_Unbranded_Static&amp;utm_term=Display&amp;utm_content=LAT_LAT630-14&amp;http://www.latuda.com target=\"_self\">        <img src=\"/var/site_5441/storage/images/media2/images/advertisement16/74977-1-eng-GB/advertisement.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"297\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"advertisement\" title=\"advertisement\" />\n        </a>\t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n            </div>\n    \n    </div><p>Add to that that I can’t get off the couch to put clothes in the washer, and doing laundry once every month or so becomes a reality. (Luckily, I have lots of pairs of underwear.) Running the washing machine so infrequently saves water and keeps laundry detergent out of the sewers.</p>\n<p>But wait, there’s more! When I am depressed, it is all I can do to get something to eat. I don’t have much appetite and when I do eat, it has to be fast and easy. Cereal is my go-to item. It is perfect: No cooking, and it’s easy to reuse the bowl and spoon after a quick rinse. Talk about reducing my carbon footprint!</p>\n<p>When I am in the midst of bipolar depression during the colder months, I spend many of my days on the couch wrapped up in a blanket. I don’t have to turn up the heat, so I save on energy consumption. I’m not getting out of the house to shop, either, so I’m in tune with the mantra “reduce, reuse, recycle.”</p>\n<p>This tongue-in-cheek perspective can be applied even to a situation that’s not really a laughing matter: The difficulty that many people with bipolar have earning a decent income because of their mood symptoms.</p>\n<p>If you can’t afford to run a car, you end up walking, biking or using mass transit to get where you need to go. Less driving means fewer emissions, lower gas usage, and less need for motor oil, windshield washer fluid or antifreeze. The tires last longer, too. I’m going to count that as another plus in the “being kind to the environment” column.</p>\n<p>Perhaps this idea struck me because I live in Portland, Oregon, which is a very environmentally conscious city. If there were a contest for the “greenest” person in town, I think I would win. Who else is going to admit that they only shower every other week, do laundry once a month, and eat from the same dish day after day?</p>\n<p>We always need to promote a more positive view of people with bipolar. So in the future, when someone asks you what you do, tell them you are doing your part to save the planet.</p>\n<p>When someone asks why you have disappeared from sight for a while, tell them you are reducing your carbon footprint.</p>\n<p>And when someone says that you are not being very sociable, just tell them, “Yeah, but I’m environmentally friendly.”</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<i>-----</i><br /><i>Dave Mowry of Portland, Oregon, is the coauthor of</i> No, Really!
