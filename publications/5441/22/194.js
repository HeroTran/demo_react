Flanigan</p>\n<p>The phrase “for your own good” is usually attached to something you know you’re not going to like — such as ending up in the hospital because of an episode of bipolar depression or mania.</p>\n<p>But the fact is, there may be times when your current safety and future wellbeing require some … well, tough medicine. Even if the hospital is not where you want to be, or what you think you need.</p>\n<p>“It can get scary,” admits Megan Chartier, a musician from Massachusetts who has bipolar I. “You’re not thinking clearly and you can feel like you’re losing a lot of your freedoms—and in some ways you are. Big decisions are being made about you. But having people around who you can trust and advocate for you is important.”</p>\n<p>Not every facility is going to offer state-of-the-art care. Some interventions can be traumatizing, such as physical restraints or a medication regimen that you haven’t agreed to. Nonetheless, a hospital stay can give you the space you need to begin to get well—a break from everyday stresses, an opportunity to get concentrated attention from professionals dedicated to pulling you back from the brink.</p>\n<p>Unlike a hospitalization for something like pneumonia, however, getting inpatient care for a mood episode may stir up difficult emotions—shame, self-blame, embarrassment. Yet mood disorders, including bipolar disorder, are the third most common cause of hospitalization in the U.S. for people ages 18 to 44, according to the Department of Health and Human Services.</p>\n<p>It often takes a shift in perspective to view going to the hospital in a positive light, rather than as some sort of disgrace or personal failing.</p>\n<p>“Being proud doesn’t make you stronger, it just makes you avoid getting help and means you suffer longer,” notes Andrew B. Klafter, MD, a psychiatrist in Cincinnati.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><b>Acute care</b></h3><p>Chartier says she has had seven or eight hospitalizations over the past five years. The ones where she was an active participant in the treatment process were easier to get through, she recalls.</p>\n<p>Participating as much as possible in your care tends to improve the outcome no matter how you are admitted (involuntarily or with your consent), where you are admitted (whether a locked ward in the community hospital or a plush private facility), and how long you stay (from 24-hour crisis care to inpatient treatment spanning several months).</p>\n<p>A 2012 study using data from 106 American hospitals found the average length of a psychiatric hospitalization was 7 to 13 days.</p>\n<p>Perhaps because of exaggerated portrayals in movies and on TV, some people look at psychiatric hospitalization as an extreme measure—almost a punishment. The opposite is more often true: It’s a form of protection.</p>\n<p>“For me, it was necessary to seek additional help because I felt unsafe on my own and couldn’t guarantee my safety,” reports J.K. of Illinois, who was hospitalized once for suicidal ideation and a second time while experiencing hallucinations. “Anyone who is in a similar situation should not feel ashamed in asking for help outside of your regular care team, family and friends.”</p>\n<p>When a psychiatrist recommends hospitalization, it’s usually intended as a short-term intervention to resolve an acute situation. Longer-term stays may be necessary depending on the situation, notes Sue DiGiovanni, MD, associate chair for clinical services in the psychiatry department at the University of Rochester Medical Center (URMC) in upstate New York.</p>\n\n<div class=\"object-center\">\t\t\n\n    \n                <div class=\"imagecenter\">\n    \n    \n                                                                                                                                    <a href=https://ad.doubleclick.net/ddm/clk/303209565;130320553;q?http://www.bipolardepressionoptions.com?utm_medium=Display&amp;utm_source=Display&amp;utm_campaign=Latuda_DTC_Unbranded_Static&amp;utm_term=Display&amp;utm_content=LAT_LAT630-14&amp;http://www.latuda.com target=\"_self\">        <img src=\"/var/site_5441/storage/images/media2/images/advertisement13/74956-1-eng-GB/advertisement.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"297\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"advertisement\" title=\"advertisement\" />\n        </a>\t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n            </div>\n    \n    </div><p>“We try to keep the hospitalization as brief as possible,” she says, “yet long enough so that [people’s] symptoms stabilize and we have time to work with them, their families or significant others, and others involved in their treatment on an outpatient basis to come up with the best possible discharge plan.”</p>\n<p>At a teaching hospital like URMC, a treatment team might include a psychiatrist, social worker, nurses, nurse practitioners, psychiatry residents, and, at times, a nutritionist and chaplain. The team coordinates on fine-tuning medications in order to rein in the mood episode and on developing the all-important discharge plan that will follow you home.</p>\n<p>Daily visits with the psychiatrist can be short, from 10 minutes to a half-hour. DiGiovanni says people may mistakenly expect to receive intensive individual psychotherapy, but the hospital is not the setting for that.</p>\n<p>Rather, the goal is to calm the crisis and have individuals exit the hospital with a blueprint for getting “connected to the resources they need,” she says.</p>\n<p>During Chartier’s last hospitalization, it took more than six months to reach a point where she was well enough to leave. At her discharge, she was worried about being assigned a different support system than the team of professionals she’d been working with for four years.</p>\n<p>However, the current arrangement has proved extremely beneficial, she says. She was connected to a program of the Massachusetts Department of Mental Health that helps adults with mental health conditions set and work toward meaningful life goals.</p>\n<p>Chartier meets once a week with a clinician to talk about anything from managing her symptoms and relationships to applying for benefits to whether she should go back to school. She also meets weekly with a peer specialist.</p>\n<p>The appointments regularly fill her with optimism and hope.</p>\n<p>“I’ve gone almost a year without being hospitalized,” she says. “For me, that’s a good run.”</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><b>Control issues</b></h3><p>There’s no denying that being on a locked hospital unit can feel like a terrifying loss of control. That can be compounded by lack of insight during hypomania or mania —meaning you don’t see why you need help in the first place—and psychotic features that make it difficult to stay grounded in reality.</p>\n<p>Jesse L., who has bipolar I and anxiety disorders, recalls that he hadn’t slept for several days before he landed in a psych ward.</p>\n<p>“I was pretty much out of my mind with confusion and minor delusions, so I was afraid,” the Nebraska man says. “But I wanted to go someplace where I could be safe until I got healthy again.”</p>\n<p>At first, the loss of his own clothes and knowing that other people were in charge of him intensified his manic paranoia. To calm his fears, he would focus on a pedestrian bridge he could see from his window and remind himself he would be walking across that bridge once he was released.</p>\n<p>Short visits with the doctor were the highlight of his stay because “he paid attention to what was happening to me,” Jesse says.</p>\n<p>Having to be hospitalized can be doubly difficult if you have negative residue from a previous experience—perhaps from feeling that certain treatments were imposed on you or because of how the staff acted.</p>\n<p>“If that’s you, don’t be ashamed of it,” says Rebecca Christofferson, a registered clinical counselor in private practice in British Columbia. “You are a survivor.”</p>\n<p>A movement labeled “trauma-informed care” recognizes the effects of feeling powerless when receiving mental health treatment. Christofferson suggests alerting the facility about any issues like that.</p>\n<p>Conflicts may arise with even the most sensitive care team, however, such as when people argue that they’re ready to go home but the doctor disagrees.</p>\n<p>“When that happens, for the patients it feels like, ‘You’re not listening to me. You’re not wanting to help me,’” explains DiGiovanni. “But there are times I have to go against what they’re saying they want because, in my professional opinion and in my good conscience, I can’t just let them go without having the kind of supports they need to be successful once they return to the community.”</p>\n<p class=\"pullQuote\"><b> </b></p>\n<h3><b>Eyes on the prize</b></h3><p>Stephen T., who lives in the Toronto area, appreciates hospitalization as a dedicated break to work out the kinks in a new medication regimen.</p>\n<p>“That’s probably the best place in the world you can try it. You’re monitored. You’re not at your job or in the real world. You can speak directly to the staff about how you’re feeling, and judge for yourself whether it’s working,” says Stephen.</p>\n<p>Medications can take from a couple of days to a few weeks to come fully online, so patience is critical.</p>\n<p>Stephen notes that in addition to the formal treatment, connecting with peers who are in the same boat can provide both important support and a source of satisfaction.</p>\n<p>“You begin to form relationships,” he says. “You’re as much helping them as they are helping you.”</p>\n<p>Stephen’s advice is drawn from three hospitalizations over seven years. Ending up in the hospital again, especially after a decent stretch of stability, can trigger feelings of hopelessness and frustration. Stephen prefers to view his repeat visits as part of the learning curve in managing his bipolar I.</p>\n<p>He’s gone nine years now without a relapse severe enough to warrant readmittance.</p>\n<p>“My close friends and family who know my personal history are proud of me, considering where I’ve been and where I am now—with a great career, a loving wife, and a young daughter,” he says.</p>\n<p>Getting released from the hospital typically doesn’t mean you’re in tiptop shape. Basically, you’re well enough to work on getting yourself healthy again, like starting rehab after a heart attack.</p>\n<p>It’s important to continue treatment—either with doctors and therapists in the community or through partial hospitalization, which is an intensive outpatient day program—to rely on your support network, and to apply yourself to self-care strategies.</p>\n<p>It’s also important not to jump right back into your usual routine as soon as you’re out. Trying to readjust too quickly could undo the progress you made during your hospital stay.</p>\n<p>If you have a job, asking for shorter hours or fewer responsibilities as you transition back will make success in the long run more likely. It may be tempting to prove you can operate at your previous level or even do more than usual, especially if work piled up while you were gone, but it’s unrealistic to expect that from yourself right away.</p>\n<p>“Understand that you’re recovering, and you’re not going to be at 100 percent capacity the first week,” says Klafter, the Cincinnati psychiatrist. “Maybe you’re at 75 percent, but that’s better than zero percent, which is what you would’ve been the week before.”</p>\n<p>It’s worth addressing any lingering negative feelings about the hospitalization in therapy or through peer support. Feeling reluctant to go back when you need to could put you in peril.</p>\n<p>“If you get to the point where you feel like you’re at risk of harming yourself or somebody else, always go to the hospital,” insists Jennifer Gerlach, a mental health clinician in Illinois, adding: “Your life is more important than that.”</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<div>\n<table bgcolor=\"#eeeeee\">\n<tr>\n    <td>\n    <h3><b>When to go</b></h3><p><b>You might need to go to the hospital if you:</b></p>\n<p>• are seeing or hearing things (hallucinations).</p>\n<p>• have bizarre or paranoid ideas (delusions).</p>\n<p>• have thoughts of hurting yourself or others.</p>\n<p>• are thinking or talking too fast, or jumping from topic to topic and not making sense.</p>\n<p>• feel too exhausted or depressed to get out of bed or take care of yourself or your family.</p>\n<p>• have problems with alcohol or substances.</p>\n<p>• have not eaten or slept for several days.</p>\n<p>• have tried outpatient treatment (therapy, medication and support) and still have symptoms that interfere with your life.</p>\n<p>• need to make a major change in your treatment or medication under the close supervision of your doctor.</p>\n<p>Source: <i>Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance</i></p>\n\n    </td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n</div><p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<div>\n<table bgcolor=\"#eeeeee\">\n<tr>\n    <td>\n    <h3><b>Making The Most Of Your Hospital Stay</b></h3><p><b>Being hospitalized during a mood episode can be vital to getting yourself back on track. Here are a few things to think about before, during, and after your stay.</b></p>\n<p><b>BEFORE.</b> When you’re well, put together a crisis plan so you and the people who support you don’t have to scramble in an emergency. Agree on what behaviors or symptoms should trigger a hospital stay and put that in writing as a memo from your healthy self to your ill self. By the time mania escalates to the point that you really need that kind of intervention, you’ll probably lack the insight to accept that you do.</p>\n<p>Advance planning also allows you to compare the various inpatient treatment options in your area. Consider qualities that are important to you, such as how modern the facility is, whether patient-centered care is the norm, if your insurance is accepted, what recreational options are available, and what the policies are on having visitors, bringing items from home, and whether you’ll be wearing hospital gowns or your own clothes.</p>\n<p>During his first hospitalization, Stephen T. of Ontario spent four weeks in an older facility that housed up to eight people in a room. When he relapsed in 2006 and again in 2008, he went to a newer place where he had his own room, ordered in Chinese food from a nearby restaurant, and brought along his guitar.</p>\n<p><b>DURING.</b> Take advantage of group therapy sessions, even if they’re optional and even if it’s difficult to muster the energy, suggests Cincinnati psychiatrist Andrew B. Klafter, MD. “You might hear something or meet someone who might have a really good impact on you,” he says.</p>\n<p>Jesse L. of Nebraska recommends bringing good reading material, if allowed. He spent a lot of time with Charles Dickens’ <i>A Tale of Two Cities</i> during his hospital stay.</p>\n<p>Kathleen O’Grady of New York state, who has been hospitalized five times, makes a point of using the gym if there is one or taking walks in the halls if there isn’t. Arranging for trusted friends and family members to visit helps, too, she says.</p>\n<p><b>AFTER.</b> Consider staying with a supportive friend or family member for a while after being discharged. Give yourself time to recuperate and re-establish your daily routines. “Leaving the comfort of a hospital is challenging,” muses Jeff Woodward of Oregon.</p>\n<p>He emphasizes the importance of following your discharge plan. “You were in the hospital for a reason,” he points out. “Take what you’ve learned and put it to use the moment you walk out that door.”</p>\n<p>Woodward recommends filling any prescriptions immediately, since you’ll probably leave the hospital with just a few days’ worth of meds. Megan Chartier of Massachusetts schedules frequent appointments with her care providers to keep up her momentum after being discharged.</p>\n<p>“I also found it helpful to schedule my time ahead so that I had little downtime,” Chartier says. “No structure in my day could lead to boredom and anxiety, but having my week mapped out ahead of time left little room for me to think about those things.”</p>\n\n    </td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n</div><p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<i>-----</i><br /><i>Robin L.

Call his story a best-case scenario of bipolar on the job.</p>\n<p>Jon, now 33, has been employed on the facilities staff at a Midwestern campus for the past couple of years. The others on his team of four know he has bipolar, something he cautiously shared in one-on-one conversations after he’d been on the job for six months or so and began to feel that they were friends.</p>\n<p>“My co-workers had no negative reactions,” he says. “They simply listened to me and my story. I didn’t feel judged in the slightest.”</p>\n<p>If he needs to leave work a little early for a therapist’s appointment, he says, “it’s just not a big deal.”</p>\n<p>He hasn’t had any big issues due to bipolar symptoms, either.</p>\n<p>“I try to be a happy and level-headed person, on my best behavior, who takes good care of myself and takes my medication regularly,” he says.</p>\n<p>Of course, the employment picture isn’t so rosy for everyone. For one thing, research suggests that from 20 to 50 percent of people with bipolar don’t have paid employment. Among those who do, some find that mood symptoms lead to trouble on the job or stigma fosters a hostile environment.</p>\n<p>When Greg S., a registered nurse, was employed at a hospital in the South three years ago, he took time off to deal with an untenable combination of family problems and his bipolar. On his return, his diagnosis somehow became common knowledge. He perceived a shift in how co-workers treated him, including how his actions and reactions were interpreted.</p>\n<p>In his experience, he explains, “Once you are ‘labeled,’ sometimes you’re not allowed to get mad anymore, or stand up for yourself when you need to. Maybe I’m given too many patients to take care of during my shift, and when I bring it up, what might have been a simple disagreement … turns into, ‘There he goes again.’”</p>\n<p>In his view, people with substance use issues get more leniency and understanding when they return after rehab than he did after his leave.</p>\n<p>“I feel it’s more culturally acceptable to be a drug addict than to have a mental illness,” he says.</p>\n<p>In some cases, the demands of a particular work situation just don’t mix well with managing bipolar. When Bijal D. had a full-time job at a construction company under a difficult boss, she had trouble staying stable—even with accommodations like getting a half- or whole day off when necessary.</p>\n<p>After a year and a half in that position, she made the difficult decision to resign. “I needed money, but my mental health was more important,” the 48-year-old says.</p>\n<p class=\"pullQuote\"><b> </b></p>\n<h3><b>LAW ON YOUR SIDE</b></h3><p>Bijal lived off her savings for a year, taking a couple of temporary jobs to tide her over. One was a part-time position with a mental health professional—and getting that position meant explaining the long gap in her résumé.</p>\n<p>“I said I had family health problems—and in fact, my father had just passed away,” she says.</p>\n<p>Explaining that you were dealing with bipolar mood episodes—or any other medical condition—likely won’t endear you to a future boss. Indeed, experience has taught Jon that radical honesty may not be the best idea when you’re trying to get work.</p>\n<p>Looking to get hired at a bookstore one summer, he listed “bipolar disorder” on a job application line that asked about having a disability. In hindsight, he says, “I really didn’t have to answer that.”</p>\n<p>Whether or not that was the reason, he didn’t get the job.</p>\n<p>“I would have been the friendliest, best bookseller ever, but I didn’t hear back,” he says.</p>\n<p>According to experts at the Job Accommodation Network, a U.S. government program that offers free advice on the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), you have no obligation to discuss your diagnosis with an employer during the hiring process.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                    <a href=https://ad.doubleclick.net/ddm/clk/303209565;130320553;q?http://www.bipolardepressionoptions.com?utm_medium=Display&amp;utm_source=Display&amp;utm_campaign=Latuda_DTC_Unbranded_Static&amp;utm_term=Display&amp;utm_content=LAT_LAT630-14&amp;http://www.latuda.com target=\"_self\">        <img src=\"/var/site_5441/storage/images/media2/images/advertisement14/74963-1-eng-GB/advertisement.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"297\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"advertisement\" title=\"advertisement\" />\n        </a>\t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>“Under the ADA, generally speaking, you don’t have to disclose a disability until you need accommodation,” says Melanie Whetzel, a consultant with the Job Accommodation Network.</p>\n<p>(Just to clear up any confusion: In mental health circles, the term “disclosure” generally refers to telling someone your diagnosis. That’s not the same as “disclosure of disability” under the ADA and another U.S. law known as the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.)</p>\n<p>The ADA prohibits discrimination against people with disabilities in a variety of arenas, including employment. Under human rights legislation in Canada, everyone has the right to equal treatment in employment and no one may be discriminated against on the basis of actual or perceived disability. (For clarification, “equal treatment” does not mean being treated the same; generally speaking, employers have a duty to provide the necessary support to perform essential job duties.)</p>\n<p>In both countries, disability is generally defined as an impairment that substantially limits an individual’s ability to carry out one or more major life activities—and that umbrella covers mental health conditions.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><b>ASKING FOR HELP</b></h3><p>Accommodations are reasonable modifications that help you remain a productive employee, such as flexible work hours, adjusting how work gets done, or tweaking the work environment. For example, if you have trouble staying focused because of fuzzy thinking during bipolar depression or when you’re overly distracted during mania, you might ask to wear earbuds to mute distracting noise or request a cubicle with higher walls.</p>\n<p>The law provides recourse against discrimination, but doesn’t guarantee you’ll have an ideal outcome in every situation. Nor does it provide blanket protection for problematic behavior: A recent court ruling in Cincinnati found for the employer when a factory worker with bipolar was dismissed for a pattern of angry outbursts.</p>\n<p>In requesting accommodations, you likely will need to provide your employer with a doctor’s note or other documentation confirming that you have an impairment—but “in most situations, you do not have to share your actual diagnosis,” says Donna Hardaker, a specialist in workplace mental health.</p>\n<p>Hardaker was director of Mental Health America of California’s Wellness Works program before taking her expertise to the Sutter Health system in Sacramento earlier this year.</p>\n<p>She recommends educating yourself about your employer’s accommodation policies before you take any action, including whether to approach an immediate supervisor, the human resources department, or your union rep, if applicable.</p>\n<p>It’s best to conduct conversations in a planned, calm manner, she notes. Consider bringing an ally into discussions if you need the support.</p>\n<p>“If possible, minimize sharing of information and requesting of help when in a highly emotional state,” says Hardaker. “Request a meeting and come prepared with information and possible strategies for accommodation.”</p>\n<p>Although employers have a legal duty no matter what, it’s good diplomacy to frame any discussions about accommodations—or medical leave—around how this will help you be a better, more productive employee.</p>\n<p>That holds true for the dreaded résumé gap, too.</p>\n<p>“If you had a gap in your work history, you would want to tell the employer if you were helping a family member, did volunteer work, or received training,” Whetzel says. “Then focus on how those experiences helped and prepared you for the next steps in your career and how ready you are to move forward.”</p>\n<p class=\"pullQuote\"><b> </b></p>\n<h3><b>NOBODY’S BUSINESS</b></h3><p>No matter what you decide to tell your boss, the human resources department, or a prospective employer, personal medical information must be kept confidential, Whetzel says. It’s your decision how much you wish to share with co-workers.</p>\n<p>“If you’ve taken time off, you can say, ‘I’m just dealing with stress and some personal issues’ and that’s enough,” she says.</p>\n<p>Choosing to be more explicit may give co-workers more context for symptoms like increased irritability or taking longer to get things done. Still, there’s no predicting how others will take the news.</p>\n<p>Bijal says that when her mood revved up, she would get hyper at work, joke, and talk very loudly—the kind of behaviors that people around her would be apt to notice. When she did share with a coworker that she has bipolar, though, she felt the person began to treat her differently, “with caution.”</p>\n<p>And after his experiences working at the hospital, Greg says, “My gut instinct is to say, ‘Don’t tell anybody.’”</p>\n<p>The decision to “come out” depends on many factors, including the nature of your job, the climate in your workplace, and whether you consider the people you work with to be good friends.</p>\n<p>If you feel you’re ready to have “the talk” with co-workers, Hardaker recommends timing it to when you’ve been doing well. Ideally, she says, you’ll be adding “new information to their already positive perception”—but she warns there’s no guarantee of a good outcome.</p>\n<p>“Be prepared for possible backlash by having your own networks of support, just in case your message can’t be heard right now,” she says.</p>\n<p>Tom (not his real name), a 30-year veteran in the human resources field, made his big reveal during a not-so-positive period.</p>\n<p>At a former job, Tom’s boss told him he was “disruptive, dysfunctional, and that I’d hurt some people with my behavior,” he recalls. In the back-and-forth over addressing the problem, his supervisor suggested that Tom write an email to the staff explaining what was behind his actions and attitude.</p>\n<p>“It completely backfired on me—these were health care workers and even they didn’t get it,” he says.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><b>COPING ON THE JOB</b></h3><p>Tom, 52, is now a human resources director at a hospital in the Northeast. Only two people on staff there know about his diagnosis—and one is his wife. The other is a nutritionist who has a son with bipolar, and who has become part of his on-site support network.</p>\n<p>To maintain privacy, Tom keeps his explanations vague when he has an appointment with someone on his treatment team.</p>\n<p>“When I need to see my doctor or therapist, I can say I have an appointment ‘out of the office.’ I go first thing in the morning or last thing in the afternoon, and other people can think I went to the dentist,” Tom says. “Or I say I have an important personal matter to take care of.’”</p>\n<p>When necessary, he takes a literal mental health day. A workplace policy called “earned time off” gives him some leeway.</p>\n<p>“Anything more than a day and I’d need permission unless I was out sick.</p>\n<p>Some places require a doctor’s note, but I never got into a situation long enough that I was asked for one.”</p>\n<p>After giving himself that bit of breathing room, Tom says, “I force myself back into the office. Otherwise things will fester too much and get worse.”</p>\n<p>His workplace behavior doesn’t make waves now that Tom is better managing his bipolar with help from his psychiatrist, therapist and a variety of coping strategies—including tai chi, hobbies like photography, and using a light therapy lamp from October through April.</p>\n<p>In the mornings, he meditates in his rocking chair and forms an intention for the day. He writes that on an index card and places it in clear view on his desk.</p>\n<p>To some degree, Tom is able to make his own workplace accommodations for milder mood fluctuations, which might cycle “from laughing to grouchy” in the course of a workday.</p>\n<p>For example, the nature of his job often requires dealing with people even when he’s feeling unsociable. One of the perks of his senior position, he notes, is flexibility in scheduling what he needs to get done when.</p>\n<p>“Yesterday I worked on projects all day in my office, not interacting and just lying low,” he explains. “Tomorrow I’ll make it up and be friendly and gracious, even if I have to play-act it out. You know what they say: ‘Fake it ’til you make it.’”</p>\n\n<div>\n<table bgcolor=\"#eeeeee\">\n<tr>\n    <td>\n    <h3><b>TO TELL THE TRUTH?</b></h3><p>If bipolar symptoms affect your ability to perform your job, it may be worth considering “disclosure of disability” (which is different from disclosing your diagnosis) to your supervisor or human resources department. This is what triggers an employer’s duty to explore accommodations. Some expert advice:</p>\n<p><b>*</b> There’s an advantage to taking action as soon as you start to have performance or conduct issues on the job. If you wait too long, “your employer doesn’t have to rescind discipline, low evaluations, or even a termination when they didn’t know a disability was a contributing factor,” says Melanie Whetzel, a consultant with the U.S. Job Accommodation Network.</p>\n<p><b>*</b> You also want to act when you’re able to have conversations in a calm, planned manner. “If possible, minimize sharing of information and requesting of help when in a highly emotional state,” says California-based workplace mental health specialist Donna Hardaker. “Request a meeting and come prepared with possible strategies for accommodation.” Consider bringing an ally into discussions if you need the support.</p>\n<p><b>*</b> Collaboration is key. “Ask your employer to work with you to develop a plan for your success,” says Mary Ann Baynton, program director for the Great-West Life Centre for Mental Health in the Workplace in Canada. Focus on solutions for how best to manage various work pressures, demands and conflicts.</p>\n<p><b>*</b> Depending on your symptoms, your plan may have to address “what the employer can and should do if you become unwell,” Baynton says. For example, if you are at risk of a psychotic episode, your manager should have contact information for your doctor or another trusted person to support you.</p>\n\n    </td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n</div><p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<div>\n<table bgcolor=\"#eeeeee\">\n<tr>\n    <td>\n    <p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><b>BEING YOUR OWN BOSS: GAIN OR LOSS?</b></h3><p>Carrie Elizabeth Lin, MA, has bipolar disorder. A licensed professional clinical counselor in Campbell, California, she chooses to have a private practice—which “allows a lot of flexibility in terms of when, where, and how I work,” she says.</p>\n<p>“With bipolar disorder, the biggest challenges I found with traditional employment were a lack of flexibility in terms of hours and a lack of control over my work environment. I was a competent and ethical professional, but in many jobs I wasn’t allowed to set my own hours or do some of my work at home.”</p>\n<p>It’s true that working for herself, by herself, means she has to forego the companionship of co-workers and the comfort of a steady paycheck. Plus, she notes, working in a traditional job provides the kind of daily structure that can be very helpful in managing bipolar.</p>\n<p>When you’re self-employed, she says, “you have to build structure and find social connections on your own.”</p>\n<p>Running your own business isn’t for everyone, however. Another option: a “portfolio career” consisting of two or more occupations, related or not.</p>\n<p>“You might have a part-time office job in the morning, tutor kids or college students in the afternoon, and walk dogs through a site like <a href=\"http://Rover.com\" target=\"_self\">Rover.com</a> on weekends,” Lin explains.</p>\n<p>Lin highly recommends using resources such as a career counselor, business coach, or vocational rehabilitation services. Another resource: “microenterprise” programs that offer guidance and financial support to start a business.</p>\n\n    </td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n</div><p> </p>\n<p>\n<i>-----</i><br /><i>Stephanie Stephens is a digital journalist and video producer/host who writes frequently about health, including mental health.

So you grab a beer, too—maybe to calm your nerves before you mingle, maybe to join the festive atmosphere, maybe even to get a buzz going.</p>\n<p>That common scenario gets more complicated when you have bipolar disorder.</p>\n<p>“We tend to look at alcohol as a beverage, but it is a drug,” says Mari Beth Lutes, a substance abuse counselor in Jacksonville, North Carolina. “Alcohol can cause someone to be elated or depressed. If they are down, they will go lower. If they are high, they’ll go higher.”</p>\n<p>When it comes to alcohol use, Lutes draws from both professional and personal experience: She spent her younger years drinking heavily, all the while living with undiagnosed bipolar disorder.</p>\n<p>The party line (no pun intended) when it comes to drinking and bipolar is pretty simple: Don’t. But many individuals who have bipolar are looking for a middle ground. They may not want to feel left out when everyone else is having a drink or two, or they may enjoy a relaxing glass of wine at the end of a long week.</p>\n<p>Is it ever OK to imbibe if you have bipolar? On a case-by-case basis, there may be some give in the blanket prohibition—but there is persuasive evidence for being a teetotaler.</p>\n<p>“The biggest problem alcohol use poses for people with bipolar is how it interacts with moods,” says Henry R. Kranzler, MD, a professor of psychiatry and director of the Center for Studies of Addiction at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia.</p>\n<p>It is tempting to drink to mute feelings of anxiety and depression—otherwise known as self-medicating—but that backfires in the long run. Alcohol actually acts as a mood depressant and its use over time can worsen bipolar depression.</p>\n<p>Drinking makes most people feel more social and less inhibited because alcohol impairs regions of the brain that help us self-monitor, Kranzler explains. But that loose and easy feeling only lasts an hour or two after the last drink. Then blood alcohol level drops, leaving you “sluggish,” he adds.</p>\n<p>Liquor can temporarily slow the disorganized, racing thoughts that accompany mania, says Anita Everett, MD, chief medical officer of the U.S. Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA).</p>\n<p>However, the lowered inhibition that comes with drinking also greases the way for risk-taking behaviors that accompany elevated mood, such as overspending, excessive arguing, unsafe driving, sexual indiscretions, and acting on grandiose ideas.</p>\n<p>“Because alcohol often acts to change the normal checks and balances in decision-making, it is easier for a person under the influence to take risks and act in ways that they would not normally act,” Everett notes.</p>\n<p>Drinking may also tip the balance when it comes to suicide attempts: “Persons who might normally think about suicide but would not act on [it] are much more likely to while under the influence,” she says.</p>\n<p>Lutes, a former naval officer who practices on a Marine Corps base, started sneaking drinks in high school and intensified her consumption in college. She says heavy alcohol use, coupled with mood shifts, fueled promiscuity.</p>\n<p>“I’d put myself in danger—go to a bar and drink all night and go home with someone I didn’t know,” the 55-year-old recalls.</p>\n<p>Lutes says she did not recognize she had a problem with drinking until she was 31, when her children were 6 and 3 years old. Full stability eluded her until her late 30s, when she was able to identify and address her underlying bipolar.</p>\n<p>“When I was diagnosed with bipolar II, I finally comprehended the word serenity,” she says.</p>\n<p class=\"pullQuote\"><b> </b></p>\n<h3>DUAL DIAGNOSES</h3><p>Another argument for abstinence: Studies have shown that people with bipolar disorder have a 60 percent chance of developing a drinking problem at some point in their lives.</p>\n<p>Given the prevalent overlap of alcohol or drug use problems and behavioral health conditions like bipolar, the U.S. National Institute of Mental Health recommends that anyone seeking help for one issue be evaluated for the other. Addressing only one half of the “dual diagnoses” equation tends to be less effective than tackling both simultaneously.</p>\n<p>Researchers are trying to puzzle out why having bipolar disorder significantly raises the risk of alcohol use disorders. It doesn’t mean that bipolar causes alcoholism, or vice versa, says Kranzler.</p>\n<p>“There’s a lot we don’t know,” he says. “We presume alcohol alters the neurotransmitter levels and their metabolism and production, but what’s actually going on is not entirely clear.”</p>\n<p>Pre-existing impulse control deficits could play a role. A study published in the September 2013 edition of the journal <i>Psychopathology</i> compared 47 participants who had bipolar disorder and an alcohol disorder with 66 individuals with bipolar disorder alone and 90 without either diagnosis. The dual diagnoses group scored significantly higher on impulsivity measures than the other two groups.</p>\n<p>Scientists also are studying inherited traits that bipolar and alcoholism share. For example, the genetic traits that appear to affect the brain chemistry linked to bipolar disorder may also be involved in how the brain responds to alcohol and other drugs, putting certain individuals at higher risk of both developing bipolar illness and becoming substance abusers.</p>\n<p>Henry Bingham has a family history of alcoholism on both sides of the family. At 12 he began raiding his dad’s unlocked liquor cabinet. By the time he was in his 30s, he’d come home from work and drink until he passed out.</p>\n<p>“I spent all my money for bills on alcohol,” says Bingham, who is now 43.</p>\n<p>He kept drinking after getting a bipolar diagnosis in 1999, although he knew it was undermining the effectiveness of his prescribed medications. He also recalls that with a few of the different meds he tried, drinking would lead to bouts of rage.</p>\n<p>Some mood stabilizers negatively interact with alcohol while others do not, says Kranzler. Often, drinking means your meds can’t do their job properly—or it may amplify side effects.</p>\n<p>“Alcohol increases the metabolism and makes some drugs lose their effectiveness,” Kranzler explains. “It can also cause dizziness and drowsiness because both alcohol and mood stabilizers have those effects.”</p>\n<p>After attending an outpatient rehabilitation program, Bingham remained sober for three years before relapsing in 2011. He attributes his lapse partly to the fact that his late wife was still using alcohol, “but also because I missed drinking.”</p>\n<p>Bingham has since relocated from Maine to California to restart his life as a widower.</p>\n<p>“I’ve not been drinking much at all since moving. I’ve kind of lost the desire to do so,” he says.</p>\n<p>He admits to worrying about slipping back into heavier drinking, but adds, “I try not to fixate on it—I don’t want to set myself up for failure. “</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>SAFETY BAR</h3><p>A family or personal history of alcohol dependence would certainly loom large in weighing whether to drink or not. Other factors: Why you drink, how much you drink, when you tend to drink, and how easily you can stop drinking when you choose.</p>\n<p>Using alcohol to numb emotional unease or stress is a maladaptive coping mechanism—something that doesn’t actually improve your situation. The same is true for using alcohol as a sleep aid.</p>\n<p>“You may fall asleep [more] easily but then wake up in the night and be unable to fall back to sleep,” Everett says.</p>\n<p>Everett isn’t opposed to drinking in moderation for all people with bipolar disorder—as long as it can be done safely.</p>\n<p>“You need to be honest with yourself. Is it really [one drink] once or twice a week? Ask your ‘pit crew’ and if they don’t feel there are any problems, it’s probably OK,” she says, referring to the people who provide you with support.</p>\n<p>Bill Beverley-Blanco, MEd, CPS, says his attitudes toward alcohol have been shaped by the 20 years he spent in the U.S. Army—“the military culture is a drinking culture,” he says—and by his upbringing, where a glass of wine with dinner was the norm.</p>\n<p>The retired lieutenant colonel, who has bipolar I, provides peer support at a Veterans Administration inpatient stabilization and recovery unit. Even so, “abstention doesn’t work for me,” the 56-year-old says.</p>\n<p>He says his alcohol consumption ranges from “almost no drinking to drinking more than I should. Then I have to bring it back. I can’t let drinking control my life.”</p>\n<p>He knows that drinking greatly influences his behavior and emotions, so he tries to monitor his mood state.</p>\n<p>“If I’m aware that I’m becoming depressive or manic, my internal control says ‘hold off.’”</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, not everyone is able to recognize when their drinking reaches the danger zone. For one thing, says Everett, dependency typically creeps up on you slowly, over a long period of time. For another, a poor sense of how you’re really functioning can be an aspect of bipolar.</p>\n<p>“It’s very hard for the person to see that the drinking can make [the bipolar] worse,” she adds. “There’s a sense of denial. That’s why we recommend family help when things are not right.”</p>\n<p>Like many clinicians, Kranzler advises zero tolerance as the best practice for those with bipolar. If that’s not what you’re doing, he recommends keeping your health care team in the loop.</p>\n<p>“A very low level of alcohol would probably not be problematic, but it really depends on the individual. You should first discuss it with your prescriber.”</p>\n<p>Natalie Miller’s psychiatrist and therapist have both cautioned her to avoid drinking, but she’s not there yet.</p>\n<p>“I used alcohol so much in the past as a coping mechanism, it was hard to eliminate it from my life completely,” says the 29-year-old, who works in a hotel and attends college in Victoria, British Columbia.</p>\n<p>These days, she says mostly it’s the “social aspect” that has her downing cans of hard cider. On occasion, though, she misses hypomania and “a light buzz from drinking can sometimes fill that void.”</p>\n<p>Miller was diagnosed with bipolar at age 25. This past winter, she achieved enduring stability for the first time since her teens. As part of her management plan, she pays close attention to any signs of emerging illness.</p>\n<p>“If I’m slightly depressed or manic I don’t go anywhere near drinking,” she says. “It makes me more depressed. I’ve learned my lesson and know where my limits are.”</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<div>\n<table bgcolor=\"#eeeeee\">\n<tr>\n    <td>\n    <h3><b>SIGNS OF PROBLEM DRINKING</b></h3><p><b>The medical definition of an alcohol use disorder is problem drinking that becomes severe.

Some people I know who have bipolar and drink seem to be fine, but some it puts them into constant mood swings and some people it only fuels the manic episodes.<br /><b>—Ryan St. John,</b> NORTHFIELD, VT</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\nI USED TO DRINK to self-medicate and to be social. One day I got so drunk I committed an act of domestic violence against my partner. I promised both of us that day that I would never drink again and I haven’t. I feel much better off and more in control of myself. I can see now how all those years of drinking made my symptoms worse and I wish I had given up alcohol years ago.<br /><b>—R.H.,</b> SALT LAKE CITY, UT</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\nI QUIT DRINKING when I was 27 because it was both exacerbating mood settings (highs and lows) and causing reckless behavior that I punished myself for afterward. I am much more stable now.<br /><b>—Name Withheld,</b> FALMOUTH, U.K.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\nMODERATION IS KEY. I keep a mood log, including alcohol consumption. The log helps keep me honest— and I’m always honest about my documentation. I generally limit myself to two beers a day, making exceptions for social gatherings, etc., where I keep to one beer per hour, plus water. I don’t do mixed drinks often, but when I do, it’s half of what I’d drink for beer, or just one per day. I can’t recommend this for everyone, but it works for me.<br /><b>—R.D.,</b> FRANKLIN, NH</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\nI LIKE TO DRINK on occasion, but my husband does not want me to. He says it affects my bipolar. I guess it takes an outside point of view to see the negative effects of drinking with bipolar because I don’t see it. My husband says drinking really has a negative impact on my moods and triggers. It annoys me that I am not allowed to drink because of my mental health issues. I don’t like the lack of control I have on this subject.<br /><b>—Anita Brubaker,</b> ST. CHARLES, IL</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\nI HAVE HAD A bipolar diagnosis for nearly 20 years and I have never had a drink, not because I have bipolar disorder but because I have a family history of alcoholism and I choose not to be one more drunk in the family.<br /><b>—B.O.,</b> YAKIMA, WA</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\nMY PSYCHIATRIST TOLD ME specifically that I should not “drink a lot” since it can induce a manic episode. It was actually binge drinking that brought on the manic episode that led to my bipolar I diagnosis. In the beginning of my treatment, I abstained from alcohol so I could focus on my recovery. However, once I became stable, I slowly started to drink again because I do like a good “Jack and Coke” or strawberry mojito when I’m out with my friends after a tough week. I keep a journal to log when I drink and how much so I can share this information with my psychiatrist. Being honest about why you’re drinking, and understanding its effects, is key.<br /><b>—C.P.,</b> LOS ANGELES, CA</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\nYOU CAN HAVE FUN in social situations with or without alcohol, but you need to know how much you can drink while staying “in control.” Once you can identify your triggers, you can test your limits to see what works with yourself. There have been times where I’m completely happy, I’m surrounded by good people that I trust, and I’m able to have a few drinks with no regrets. Sometimes after one drink I can feel myself slowly crashing and that’s when I stop drinking and find my way back to level ground.<br /><b>—K.V.,</b> TRAVERSE CITY, MI</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\nI DISLIKE BLANKET STATEMENTS that no one with bipolar should drink. I drink maybe once or twice a month. Why change something I enjoy in the absence of harm? My psychiatrist says a little in moderation is fine for me, with a caution about drug interactions. I’m always sober when I take my nighttime meds. Everyone is different. Some people with bipolar should not drink at all due to meds, brain chemistry, problematic behavior, history, or who knows what.<br /><b>—R.O.,</b> BRITISH COLUMBIA</p>\n","layout":{},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":1,"link_source":"","competition":[],"flatplan_title":"","notes":"","gutter_credit":"","other":"","image":[{"id":"b11e20f7111fadaff12d828f381a20ed","name":"bipolar-DRINKING-soundoff","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_5441/storage/images/media2/images/bipolar-drinking-soundoff/74942-1-eng-GB/bipolar-drinking-soundoff.jpg?t=default_ipad_portrait&ext/bipolar-drinking-soundoff_default_ipad_portrait.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"768","height":"275","legacy_id":"4616","is_default":true},{"id":"b11e20f7111fadaff12d828f381a20ed","name":"bipolar-DRINKING-soundoff","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_5441/storage/images/media2/images/bipolar-drinking-soundoff/74942-1-eng-GB/bipolar-drinking-soundoff.jpg?t=default_ipad_landscape&ext/bipolar-drinking-soundoff_default_ipad_landscape.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"1024","height":"366","legacy_id":"4616","is_default":false}],"url_alias":"http://bpmagazine.audiencemedia.com","type":"story","order":"16","folio_number":"33","folio_numbers":"33,34","pdf_page_index":"33","thumbnail":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_5441/storage/images/media2/images/bipolar-drinking-soundoff/74942-1-eng-GB/bipolar-drinking-soundoff.jpg?t=tablet_story_thumbnail&ext/bipolar-drinking-soundoff_tablet_story_thumbnail.jpg","color":"FFFFFF","real_id":"4531","main_section_id":"194","ads":[]}],"type":null,"ads":[]}}
