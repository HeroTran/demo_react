<p>We know that getting mood symptoms under control is the first step in managing bipolar disorder. But there’s a way bigger picture to consider: What are your values and goals? What’s your truest vision of a satisfying and fulfilling life? For a lot of people, that ideal includes having a job.</p>
<p>The good news is that—depending on which study you look at—from half to three-fourths of people with bipolar have some form of paid employment. Symptoms don’t stay home when you go to work, though. What happens when that affects your job performance and job security? “What to Say at Work—and When” looks at how to decide if you want to take advantage of legal protections and ask for accommodations.</p>
<p>“A Safe Space” tackles another serious subject: Getting hospitalized during a severe mood episode. Whether it turns out to be a hateful experience or a helpful respite, there are times when a hospital stay is absolutely necessary for your welfare.</p>
<p>Recalling a manic episode marked by delusions and paranoia, one Nebraska man explains: “I wanted to go someplace where I could be safe until I got healthy again.” Still, the prospect of handing over control to hospital staff can be scary. That’s why our story covers what to expect, how to prepare, and how to make the most of your stay.</p>
<p>To drink or not to drink? That’s the question in “Sober Consideration.” The medical advice would be “not.” Yet many people look for that middle ground and answer “in moderation” or “only at parties.”</p>
<p>Although it’s tempting to use alcohol to subdue feelings of anxiety and depression—known as “self-medicating”—that can backfire in the long run by worsening bipolar depression, increasing risk-taking in hypo/mania, and tipping the balance when it comes to acting on suicidal thoughts. Plus, research shows that having bipolar makes you especially susceptible to developing a drinking problem.</p>
<p>Our story takes a candid look at how others have decided to deal with drinking—from abstaining completely to modifying their intake in light of their current mood symptoms.</p>
<p>Coping with bipolar obviously isn’t funny business … but finding humor in it is a great defense, a way to take the edge off unpleasant experiences and regain control over recovery. Taking center stage in “On My Mind: Finding the Funny in Bipolar Depression” is bphope’s good friend, blogger and comedian Dave Mowry (pictured here). Dave admittedly takes a skewed view of the dark stretches when he barely showers, never cooks and retreats to his couch. His version: Bipolar depression is environmentally friendly! Sometimes laughter is the best medicine.</p>
