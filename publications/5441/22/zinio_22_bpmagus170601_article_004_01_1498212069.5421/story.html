<h2>ON IMPULSE</h2><p>
EXCELLENT ARTICLE, Robin Flanigan! (“Impulse Power,” Spring 2017.) I have a real issue with impulsively spending money. Not unusual for an individual with bipolar! I don’t want to give my credit card to my husband because spending seems to be one of my coping devices. Nothing I have tried to control the impulse has worked. I appreciate the list of ideas I can utilize to mitigate some of the worse aspects of my impulsivity. I now possess a few more tools in my tool box.<br /><b>—Dixie</b> via bphope.com</p>

A VERY well-thought-out article. In dealing with impulse buying I have discovered a series of things that help me stay financially healthy while giving me the sense of satisfaction from shopping. I start with an empty basket, whether at T.J. Maxx, Target or the thrift store. I walk through the aisles looking at all the pretty, cool items, touching them, thinking about where they might look best. Then I park the basket in the last row and leave. Without anything. It is psychologically rewarding and financially responsible.<br /><b>—Sally</b> via bphope.com</p>

WHAT TIMING! Just yesterday I found myself doubling the speed limit and passing across solid center lines, even though I was not in a rush. I was aware of impetuous behavior as a symptom of bipolar mania, but feel stable right now. I didn’t have anything to which I attributed the reckless driving, but I convinced myself it had nothing to do with the disorder. Having read this article, I’m not so sure. The thing I do know is that I must rein in my driving habits to avoid hurting someone.<br /><b>—Ettrick</b> via bphope.com</p>

I HAVE SPENT at least three weeks wondering but thinking my last online shopping probably wasn’t hypomania. Now that I’ve read this article, I think maybe I really was hypomanic. I couldn’t sleep and got up and went shopping, buying three different perfumes I’d been wanting, spending more than $200. This article spells out what I was feeling and doing that night. By the way, I didn’t bankrupt myself, just have less in that account than I’d like.<br /><b>—Pink</b> via bphope.com</p>

ALWAYS NICE LEARNING something new about my illness. Thanks for a great article.<br /><b>—Name Withheld</b></p>

I DON’T AGREE WITH the following statement by Michael E. Thase, MD, in this well-written article: “Just because it’s in the brain doesn’t mean it’s out of your control.” Bipolar II, rapid cycling, causes me to say things impulsively (telling someone off) and it has ruined many friendships. I do not believe that for me, in the moment, it is always in my control. Mood-stabilizing meds help a lot, but what has helped more is redirecting that mechanism. I became a volunteer that fights for a cause I believe in. Telling the government off is better than telling a friend off!<br /><b>—phoenix rising</b> via bphope.com</p>

GREAT INFORMATION. Nice to know it’s not just me. I feel validated. I will try some of your suggestions to keep myself out of trouble.<br /><b>—Kimberlee</b> via bphope.com</p>

I LOVE THE MAGAZINE and have often felt “supported” hearing from so many others who have dealt with and are dealing with similar challenges that accompany bipolarity. There is much written about mania-driven behaviors of gambling, drinking and shopping. But I feel that there is still an aversion to straightforward conversation about mania and sexual “side effects.” I feel that keeping this part of bipolar hidden, or more hushed than other discussed activities, doesn’t help remove the overall stigma of mental illness. Anything that contributes to the stigma keeps others from seeking needed treatment.<br /><b>—Name Withheld,</b> STAMFORD, CT</p>

    </div><h2>FAMILY AFFAIRS</h2><p>
I WANT TO THANK the three families who shared their experiences in parenting (“Profiles in Parenting,” Spring 2017). Although every family’s story is different and we are all in unique situations, I love to hear what other people are doing to get through. I couldn’t talk about my own experiences for so long but I’ve always admired those who could and did. Most of the time, I can pull some nugget of insight and apply it to our situation. Despite, or due to, years of constant vigilance and adjustments my daughter seems to be on the road to stability as a young adult. I hope I’m brave enough to share our story someday as well.<br /><b>—Brooke,</b> NASHVILLE, TN</p>

<p>
AS THE SINGLE PARENT of a teen with bipolar, I’m curious why you only profiled two-parent, middle-class families in this article. There are many single-parent families and others who advocate for their children but do not have the resources of time and money these families have. We, too, could use some examples of proactive parenting.<br /><b>—Keri</b> via bphope.com</p>
<p> </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>EXERCISE OBSTACLES</h2><p>
THANK YOU for the article “Action Plan” (Spring 2017). Exercise has been the bane of my existence for the past six years. The “roadblocks” you listed resonate with me, but none more so than No. 10: I feel too awful to exercise. I have days that I don’t even leave the house. I know that may sound familiar to someone with bipolar. If only I could take that one step! I will endeavor to try one of your well-thought-out ideas.<br /><b>—Dixie</b> via bphope.com</p>

<h2>OPPOSING ISOLATION</h2><p>
JULIE FAST’S COLUMN on bipolar disorder and isolation (“Ending Depression Isolation,” Spring 2017) is so intelligent, insightful and actionable!<br /><b>—Ken</b> via bphope.com</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
I ALSO HAVE FOUND that doing the opposite of what I am feeling helps me. Knowing that I have accomplished something, no matter how small, is satisfying. It prevents feelings of guilt over not having accomplished anything, which only fuels the worthless feelings and drives one deeper into depression. Doing the opposite of what I feel actually prevents the depression from progressing deeper or, at least, slows down the process. Thank you, Julie, for sharing your experience. You validated one of my coping skills and it’s good to know I’m not the only one who does this.<br /><b>—JourneyUpward</b> via bphope.com</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
MY THERAPIST SAYS I have to do what’s best for me (when I figure that out, as every situation is different and I have to weigh the pros and cons of a decision before I choose to commit to a social engagement). I no longer aim to please or to impress others. If I can’t go, I don’t—a simple no, with no explanation. If my anxiety is high I definitely stay home where it is safe.<br /><b>—S.F.</b> via bphope.com</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
WHAT IF DURING MY depressive states, I get a certain comfort and contentment from being in bed all day? It’s sort of a safe and comfortable escape from all that I fear and worry about with my life. Should I still be social and get out of that bed? Or ride it out?<br /><b>—E.C.</b> via bphope.com</p>

<h2>MORE TO BE DONE</h2><p>
I AGREE WITH Stephen Propst’s column “A Problematic Paradox” (Spring 2017). I think it is well known, at least by those who have a mental illness as well as those who work in the profession (I do both), that yes, we have as a society and government made progress [against stigma] since the 1950s and each decade since, but there is still more to be done. I’m not sure if education is the answer (some may not be interested), but I do think that by not advocating for ourselves we are only perpetuating the stigma. Where to go from here?<br /><b>—Katey</b> via bphope.com</p>

AN EXCELLENT ARTICLE with significant truths about our society’s mental health stigma. Indeed, it needs fixing!<br /><b>—Meil</b> via bphope.com</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
CLOSE FAMILY KNOW I live with bipolar II, but the “general public” people I come in contact with on a fairly regular basis don’t know. My two employers don’t know and they are both psychiatrists. I don’t want to be viewed as having a mental illness. I think it’s private.<br /><b>—Judge</b> via bphope.com</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
THANKS AS ALWAYS, STEVE, for your personal insight and the ability to put it into words. Your advocacy gives hope to many and helps those who struggle daily with the stigma of having a bipolar diagnosis.<br /><b>—Vilda</b> via bphope.com</p>
<p> </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>RESPECTFUL RELATIONSHIPS</h2><p>
I AM STILL LEARNING how to not overreact to anyone who is telling me what to do or how to do it. It gets pretty scary to hear myself react and feel angry. Your Ask the Doctor column on “Personal Boundaries” (Spring 2017) will certainly be one I will keep handy to read. Thank you for your compassion and love.<br /><b>—M</b> via bphope.com</p>

<h2>BEYOND PRINT</h2><p>
FOR 50 YEARS I have been trying to understand my behavior, behavior that I have always been told was abnormal. I have spent 30 years with the trial and error of psychiatry. I have only been following you on Facebook for a few months, but in those few months you have given me information to understand myself. Even in the last few weeks I have felt like I am coming alive again. Some of the things that I read have explained past behaviors that baffled me. Thank you for helping me understand myself.<br /><b>—C.A.</b> via bphope.com</p>

I FOUND ‘BP MAGAZINE’ by chance last year and now receive your e-newsletters. I am getting so much information about my mental health condition which has helped me so much in my recovery. So I just want to say a big thanks to your staff and all of your online followers.<br /><b>—Beverly Dick,</b> GLASGOW, SCOTLAND</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
THIS IS JUST TO thank you for the e-newsletters I get and how much they help me by educating me about my illness and giving me tips and ideas to share with my wife and other loved ones on how to cope with my illness along with me. Keep it coming, please.<br /><b>—Bill Williamson,</b> VICTORIA, BC</p>
