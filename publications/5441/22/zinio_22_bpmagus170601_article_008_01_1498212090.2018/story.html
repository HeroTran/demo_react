<h3>Proposed bill directs US agency to tailor outreach for Asian-Americans</h3><p>June 1, 2017, WASHINGTON, DC —A bill introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives aims to reduce stubborn stigma that keeps Asian-Americans and Pacific Islanders suffering in silence.</p>
<p>The bill would mandate the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration to reach out to those communities to raise awareness about behavioral health. According to the American Psychological Association, those population groups are three times less likely to seek mental health care than Americans of European descent, NBC News reports.</p>
<p>Rep. Judy Chu of California, who introduced the bill, said language barriers and cultural beliefs contribute to lower rates of help-seeking. The “model minority” myth, which wrongly imagines that Asian-Americans don’t have the same problems as other groups, only makes it worse, she said.</p>

<h3>Mounties in Alberta required to take resiliency training</h3><p>April 30, 2017, SPRUCE GROVE, AB—The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) division in Alberta is using a program called the Road to Mental Readiness (R2MR) in an effort to prevent post-traumatic stress disorder and other mental health issues, the <i>Spruce Grove Examiner</i> reports.</p>
<p>The program, which is mandatory in the RCMP’s K Division, provides information on the short-term and long-term effects of trauma, teaches self-management strategies and resiliency skills, and directs those in need to additional resources.</p>
<p>It’s also an effort to challenge stigma in what can be a very stressful work environment. Const. Shelley Nasheim said officers are often hesitant to admit they need help out of fear they’ll be viewed as weak, unable to do their work, or “faking it.” The R2MR workshop “gives us permission to come forward and deal with it, because not dealing with it is causing nothing but harm,” Nasheim said.</p>
