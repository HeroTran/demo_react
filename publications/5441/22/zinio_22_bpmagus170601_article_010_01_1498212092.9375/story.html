<h3>Identifying major factors in workplace impairment</h3><p>June 1, 2017, ANN ARBOR, MI—A lengthy study of how bipolar disorder affects functioning in employment highlights the damaging impact of bipolar depression and cognitive impairments.</p>
<p>American researchers followed more than 270 adults with diagnoses on the bipolar spectrum over five years to study work attendance, conflict, enjoyment, and performance in the workplace.</p>
<p>The study found people with higher levels of depression and greater deficits in cognitive flexibility (the ability to switch between modes of thought and consider multiple concepts at once) were more likely to have poorer work attendance, lower quality of work, and reduced satisfaction from work.</p>
<p>(Turn to our story “What to Say at Work—and When” on page 22 for how to handle bipolar-related issues with job performance.)</p>
<p>The researchers said their findings show the need for interventions that focus on treating depressive symptoms and neurocognitive deficits so people with bipolar can live more productive, satisfying and financially secure lives.</p>
<p>The study, which appeared in the <i>Journal of Affective Disorders</i>, was entitled “Depression and executive functioning deficits predict poor occupational functioning in a large longitudinal sample with bipolar disorder.”</p>

<h3>Aggression delays bipolar depression</h3><p>May 1, 2017, PHILADELPHIA, PA—Aggression appears to keep the depressive phase of bipolar disorder at bay longer, a new study suggests.</p>
<p>American researchers noted a growing body of evidence that suggests bipolar disorder is associated with higher levels of aggressive behavior. They looked at about 120 young adults, checking in every four months for more than three years.</p>
<p>The team found that, overall, physical and verbal aggression predicted a longer time to major depressive episode onset even after controlling for depressive and manic symptoms at the start of the study, family history of mood disorder, treatment seeking for mood problems, and impulsivity.</p>
<p>Aggression did not, however, significantly predict the time to manic episodes.</p>
<p>The study, which appeared in the journal <i>Behavior Therapy</i>, was entitled “Aggression protects against the onset of major depressive episodes in individuals with bipolar spectrum disorder.”</p>

<h3>Sleep apnea linked with bipolar disorder</h3><p>May 1, 2017, TAINAN, Taiwan—Sleep apnea, or frequent halts in breathing while asleep, has been linked with bipolar disorder in a new study.</p>
<p>Taiwanese researchers looked at more than 5,000 people with sleep apnea and more than 27,000 people who did not have the condition. They found that people with sleep apnea were two to three times more likely to get a bipolar disorder diagnosis as compared to people without sleep apnea.</p>
<p>The authors said their findings indicate that health professionals should carefully monitor the psychological health of individuals with sleep apnea.</p>
<p>The study, which appeared in the journal <i>Sleep and Breathing</i>, was entitled “Sleep apnea is associated with an increased risk of mood disorders: A population-based cohort study.”</p>

<h3>Support from peer specialist has strong impact on self-efficacy</h3><p>May 1, 2017, HAMBURG, Germany—One-to-one peer support appears beneficial for people with bipolar disorder in terms of improving their confidence about being able to complete tasks and reach goals, a new study suggests.</p>
<p>German researchers looked at people with bipolar and other psychiatric disorders who received one-to-one peer support from trained peer specialists along with treatment as usual over six months, and compared them with people who had only treatment as usual.</p>
<p>Six months after the study, those receiving one-to-one peer support had significantly higher self-efficacy, a term that refers to believing in your own ability to exercise control over your behavior and social environment.</p>
<p>The study, which appeared in the journal <i>European Psychiatry</i>, was entitled “Effectiveness of one-to-one peer support for patients with severe mental illness — a randomised controlled trial.”</p>

<h3>Enhanced treatment gets better results in medication adherence, other measures</h3><p>April 27, 2017, QAZVIN, Iran—Motivational interviewing and psychoeducation can help boost medication adherence in people with bipolar disorder, a new study suggests.</p>
<p>A team of Iranian, American, Chinese and British researchers compared the impact of combining those add-on treatments with usual care at 10 academic centers. In motivational interviewing, a psychotherapist guides the client toward behavioral change by helping to clarify goals and address barriers. Psychoeducation refers to providing information that increases understanding about the illness and coping strategies.</p>
<p>Compared to people who received treatment as usual only, participants in the enhanced treatment group demonstrated a greater increase in medication adherence, as well as greater improvements in clinical symptoms, quality of life, coping planning, and several other measures.</p>
<p>The study, which appeared in the journal <i>Psychological Medicine</i> online ahead of print, was entitled “Promoting medication adherence among patients with bipolar disorder: A multicenter randomized controlled trial of a multifaceted intervention.”</p>

<h3>Rates of metabolic syndrome twice as high among younger adults with bipolar disorder</h3><p>April 2, 2017, PELOTAS, Brazil—Young adults experiencing bipolar depression have significantly higher rates of metabolic syndrome symptoms than their peers without a psychiatric diagnosis, a new study has found.</p>
<p>Researchers with Brazilian and Canadian credentials looked at nearly 1,000 people ages 24 to 30 to analyze the cluster of risk factors constituting metabolic syndrome, including levels of blood glucose and cholesterol. People with metabolic syndrome are on a path to develop chronic health problems such as diabetes and heart disease.</p>
<p>While 22 percent of people without a mood disorder had metabolic syndrome, nearly 47 percent of those with bipolar had the condition. Individuals with a mood disorder were also more likely to have a higher body mass index than the general population.</p>
<p>The study, which appeared in the <i>Journal of Psychiatric Research</i> online ahead of print, was entitled “Metabolic syndrome in subjects with bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder in a current depressive episode: Population-based study.”</p>

<h3>Mindfulness therapy has lasting benefits</h3><p>April 14, 2017, GENEVA, Switzerland—Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) appears to have lasting benefits for people with bipolar disorder, a new study suggests.</p>
<p>Swiss and French researchers looked at the impact of MBCT on people with bipolar I or II who underwent at least four sessions. They surveyed participants two years after the training and found that incorporating mindfulness practices and mindful breathing into daily life on a regular basis was associated with better prevention of depressive relapse.</p>
<p>The study, which appeared in the <i>Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine</i> online ahead of print, was entitled “Self-reported long-term benefits of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy in patients with bipolar disorder.”</p>

<h3>Common for anxiety to occur separately from mood episodes</h3><p>April 1, 2017, HALIFAX, NS—Anxious symptoms are highly common in people with bipolar disorder even when bipolar symptoms are in remission, a new study suggests.</p>
<p>Canadian, American, Australian and Finnish researchers analyzed 10 studies involving thousands of people and found that among individuals with bipolar who were not experiencing a current mood shift, a third met the diagnostic criteria for one or more anxiety disorders.</p>
<p>Compared to the general population, people with bipolar were nearly five times more likely to have an anxiety disorder.</p>
<p>The authors said that people with bipolar should be routinely assessed for anxiety disorders in order to start treatment targeting anxiety if necessary.</p>
<p>The study, which appeared in the journal <i>Psychological Medicine</i>, was entitled “Prevalence of current anxiety disorders in people with bipolar disorder during euthymia: A meta-analysis.”</p>

<h3>Euthymic children with bipolar display deficits in memory, learning but not problem-solving</h3><p>April 1, 2017, FORTALEZA, Brazil—Children with bipolar disorder appear to have significant cognitive deficits that affect learning and memory, a new study suggests.</p>
<p>Brazilian, British, Australian, Canadian, Spanish and Danish researchers conducted an analysis of dozens of studies to find data on euthymic children with bipolar (not currently in either an elevated or depressed state). Compared to kids without bipolar, they demonstrated moderate to large impairments in verbal learning, verbal memory, working memory, visual learning, and visual memory.</p>
<p>Concentration, problem-solving, and processing speed (how long it takes to act on information in order to perform a task) were not markedly different in the children with bipolar.</p>
<p>The study, which appeared in the <i>Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry</i>, was entitled “Cognitive impairment in euthymic pediatric bipolar disorder: A systematic review and meta-analysis.”</p>

<h3>Poor response to lithium treatment linked to childhood physical abuse</h3><p>April 1, 2017, PARIS, France—Surviving physical abuse as a child appears to make people with bipolar disorder less likely to respond to treatment with lithium later in life, a new study suggests.</p>
<p>French and British researchers looked at almost 150 people with bipolar currently in a stable mood. They found about 20 percent responded excellently to lithium and about half were partial responders. The other 30 percent showed no response.</p>
<p>The study found that a higher level of childhood physical abuse significantly correlated with a lower level of response to lithium. In addition, a history of mixed bipolar episodes was independently associated with poor response to lithium.</p>
<p>The study, which appeared in the journal <i>Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica</i>, was entitled “Childhood trauma and mixed episodes are associated with poor response to lithium in bipolar disorders.”</p>

<h3>Higher mortality with bipolar seen even in a country with universal health care</h3><p>April 1, 2017, TEL AVIV, Israel—Mortality rates for people with bipolar disorder are higher than the general public even in a country with health care coverage for all, a new study suggests.</p>
<p>Researchers in Israel, which has universal health care, compared people with and without bipolar disorder. They found those with bipolar accessed health services such as lab tests, visits to specialists, and medications as much as the comparison group, yet their mortality risk was 1.7 times greater.</p>
<p>Results were similar for a subgroup of people with bipolar and co-morbid diabetes.</p>
<p>The study, which appeared in the <i>Canadian Journal of Psychiatry</i>, was entitled “Health care and mortality among persons with severe mental illness.”</p>

<h3>Different risk factors for men, women to get mania after antidepressant use</h3><p>April 1, 2017, NEWCASTLE UPON TYNE, United Kingdom—European researchers say that for the first time, they’ve been able to identify gender differences in the risk factors for developing mania after stand-alone antidepressant treatment.</p>
<p>Among men with bipolar disorder, the strongest risk factors were a history of one or more suicide attempts, higher number of depressive episodes per year of illness, and the presence of an alcohol and/or substance abuse disorder.</p>
<p>Among women with bipolar, risk factors included a positive history of thyroid disorder, a positive family history of bipolar I disorder, and depressive onset of bipolar illness.</p>
<p>The study, which appeared in the journal <i>Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica</i> online ahead of print, was entitled “A re-examination of antidepressant treatment-emergent mania in bipolar disorders: Evidence of gender differences.”</p>
