DRINKING MAKES ME FEEL lethargic and depressed the next day. When I’m manic it lowers my inhibitions and I make poor choices. I rarely drink since my diagnosis, and when I do it’s just one glass of wine or a beer. I think bipolar and drinking don’t mix. In social situations I order tonic water with a sprig of mint. It looks like I’m drinking and no one asks questions. It was hard at first, since I live in wine country, but it gets easier with time.<br />—<b>Jeannie Anderson,</b> SANTA ROSA, CA</p>

IT’S A BAD IDEA because you are going down a slippery slope that can cause you to go manic. And you know what happens when you go manic: reckless behavior. The price is too high.<br />—<b>Tim Maynor,</b> SOUTH PITTSBURG, TN</p>

BEING A 27-YEAR-OLD with bipolar can be difficult when it comes to alcohol. You want to party but you know you have to set limits. Drinking occasionally is definitely fine. I just think you need to be cautious on how much is too much and how it will clash with your medication. I’ve had trial and error a few times. Everything is a learning process. You aren’t human if you don’t mess up sometimes.<br />—<b>B.M.,</b> PHILADELPHIA, PA</p>

MY EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN that bipolar and alcohol are a bad mix even in small amounts. As my symptoms got more out of control (overspending, inability to sleep, racing thoughts) I used more alcohol to stop the mental chaos. Then binge drinking gave way to depression and suicidal thoughts and attempts. Eventually I sought help and got sober. For me, sobriety gives me the ability to make good decisions and take good care of myself. I choose to say no to alcohol. Best decision ever.<br /><b>—P.P.,</b> CORSICANA, TX</p>

BEING DIAGNOSED WITH bipolar disorder in my early 20s, my prime drinking years were cut short. I currently don’t drink at all and haven’t for three years. Not only would it interact with the heavy medication I’m on, I can’t be certain what kind of mood swing I’ll be facing. In social situations I usually joke about not being able to drink while sipping on a cola, mildly jealous of everyone else, but my mental health is more important than being “cool.” As for other individuals with the disorder, I would say know your limits and check with your doctor before drinking.<br />—<b>Gina Iandoli,</b> NEW JERSEY</p>

I USED TO DRINK A LOT and it screwed things up in my life and made my medication less effective. So I stopped drinking. I know that when I really want a drink, I shouldn’t be having one. As for social situations, I just say I don’t drink anymore as it messes with my meds. People don’t get to know what meds they are, but that reasoning is generally accepted. And if it’s not, then you are around the wrong people if they pressure you to drink when you do not want to.<br /><b>—C.H.,</b> SPRINGFIELD, OR</p>

I DO DRINK, but I rarely make the decision to drink independently. I generally rely on others I trust to help me decide if drinking is a good idea at that time. And two is pretty much my limit at any time.<br /><b>—J.T.,</b> FOREST PARK, IL</p>

I HAVE LEARNED that I need to examine myself before I ever have the first drink. I am completely capable of drinking socially and occasionally at home. I am also someone who struggles with limits. The hardest thing I have had to learn is that just because I drank yesterday with no negative ramifications, does not mean that I can today.<br /><b>—R.M.,</b> TENNESSEE</p>

I DRINK VERY RARELY. I have “out of body” feelings so I would just rather not drink. I use the excuse of having to drive.<br /><b>—Angela McManus,</b> MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIA</p>

I WOULD SAY it’s different from person to person. Some people I know who have bipolar and drink seem to be fine, but some it puts them into constant mood swings and some people it only fuels the manic episodes.<br /><b>—Ryan St. John,</b> NORTHFIELD, VT</p>

I USED TO DRINK to self-medicate and to be social. One day I got so drunk I committed an act of domestic violence against my partner. I promised both of us that day that I would never drink again and I haven’t. I feel much better off and more in control of myself. I can see now how all those years of drinking made my symptoms worse and I wish I had given up alcohol years ago.<br /><b>—R.H.,</b> SALT LAKE CITY, UT</p>

I QUIT DRINKING when I was 27 because it was both exacerbating mood settings (highs and lows) and causing reckless behavior that I punished myself for afterward. I am much more stable now.<br /><b>—Name Withheld,</b> FALMOUTH, U.K.</p>

<p>
MODERATION IS KEY. I keep a mood log, including alcohol consumption. The log helps keep me honest— and I’m always honest about my documentation. I generally limit myself to two beers a day, making exceptions for social gatherings, etc., where I keep to one beer per hour, plus water. I don’t do mixed drinks often, but when I do, it’s half of what I’d drink for beer, or just one per day. I can’t recommend this for everyone, but it works for me.<br /><b>—R.D.,</b> FRANKLIN, NH</p>

I LIKE TO DRINK on occasion, but my husband does not want me to. He says it affects my bipolar. I guess it takes an outside point of view to see the negative effects of drinking with bipolar because I don’t see it. My husband says drinking really has a negative impact on my moods and triggers. It annoys me that I am not allowed to drink because of my mental health issues. I don’t like the lack of control I have on this subject.<br /><b>—Anita Brubaker,</b> ST. CHARLES, IL</p>

I HAVE HAD A bipolar diagnosis for nearly 20 years and I have never had a drink, not because I have bipolar disorder but because I have a family history of alcoholism and I choose not to be one more drunk in the family.<br /><b>—B.O.,</b> YAKIMA, WA</p>

MY PSYCHIATRIST TOLD ME specifically that I should not “drink a lot” since it can induce a manic episode. It was actually binge drinking that brought on the manic episode that led to my bipolar I diagnosis. In the beginning of my treatment, I abstained from alcohol so I could focus on my recovery. However, once I became stable, I slowly started to drink again because I do like a good “Jack and Coke” or strawberry mojito when I’m out with my friends after a tough week. I keep a journal to log when I drink and how much so I can share this information with my psychiatrist. Being honest about why you’re drinking, and understanding its effects, is key.<br /><b>—C.P.,</b> LOS ANGELES, CA</p>

YOU CAN HAVE FUN in social situations with or without alcohol, but you need to know how much you can drink while staying “in control.” Once you can identify your triggers, you can test your limits to see what works with yourself. There have been times where I’m completely happy, I’m surrounded by good people that I trust, and I’m able to have a few drinks with no regrets. Sometimes after one drink I can feel myself slowly crashing and that’s when I stop drinking and find my way back to level ground.<br /><b>—K.V.,</b> TRAVERSE CITY, MI</p>

I DISLIKE BLANKET STATEMENTS that no one with bipolar should drink. I drink maybe once or twice a month. Why change something I enjoy in the absence of harm? My psychiatrist says a little in moderation is fine for me, with a caution about drug interactions. I’m always sober when I take my nighttime meds. Everyone is different. Some people with bipolar should not drink at all due to meds, brain chemistry, problematic behavior, history, or who knows what.<br /><b>—R.O.,</b> BRITISH COLUMBIA</p>
