<p>The preoccupation many of us have with national politics these days is overwhelming. Many people are checking news and social media feeds on the hour and continually engaging in discussions that are fraught with strife and despair over the environment, national security, and the future of health care. Never in modern history has the nation been so polarized in its political views, with each side equally convinced of its virtue.</p>
<p>An individual with bipolar disorder—who often has intrinsically unstable moods to begin with—can find it very challenging to deal with the constant stimuli from the news, interpersonal tensions, and anxiety about the future.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><b>Everyone I know—family, friends, coworkers—is so riled up about politics. How can we coexist in peace when we don’t see eye to eye?</b></h2><p>More than ever before, my patients are finding themselves in uncomfortable situations wherein political disagreements lead to fierce arguments that primarily serve to upset everyone and lead to disrupted sleep, unstable moods, and unhelpful behaviors (e.g., substance abuse, fights).</p>
<p>Best is to stay out of circular and toxic confrontations. Prepare a sentence to use when the temperature of the conversation goes up, such as “This is not a good time to talk about this,” or “This is an important issue—but we need to focus on xyz now.”</p>
<p>Avoid senseless arguments with people who are entrenched in their ideas. You will not change anyone’s mind, nor are they likely to change yours.</p>
<p>When you get upset, it is important to implement your “go-to” activity to calm down. Listen to a favorite song, go to yoga class, or do whatever it is that gives you peace. If you do not have a “go-to” activity, talk with a confidante or health-care specialist to develop one (or more). Avoid alcohol and other addictive behaviors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><b>How can I manage my stress over the current political situation?</b></h2><p>In response to potential threats to mood stability, a standard routine needs to be in place that includes medication checks (are blood levels OK?) and a review of personal health practices (sleep, appetite, exercise).</p>
<p>But meds and personal health practices alone cannot stop the bombardment of news and the addiction to checking social media that cause turmoil. I would recommend giving the techniques of mindfulness your full attention.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><b>What is “mindfulness,” and how can it help?</b></h2><p>Mindfulness is the state of active and open attention to the present, acknowledging and experiencing one’s own feelings: “I feel angry” or “I feel happy.” When one is mindful of emotional states, one is able to be an observer of one’s own state, identify the specific state, and determine an appropriate intervention, if needed. For example, when you are aware that an unpleasant experience is causing you distress, you can decide to go for a walk, play tennis, or read a book from your favorite genre. The key is to be able to <i>identify</i> the internal emotion and <i>implement</i> the intervention.</p>
<p>There are mindfulness programs at many wellness centers. Call around and find out what’s available where you live.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><b>Can you recommend some reading on mindfulness?</b></h2><p>There are many books written on mindfulness and related techniques. Your library can help you in selecting something in the genre of self-help. Start with something easy; for example, <i>Wherever You Go, There You Are,</i> by Jon Kabat-Zinn, one of the major advocates of mindfulness. Another favorite of mine—a few years ago I gave a copy to everyone on my staff!—is <i>The Four Agreements</i>, by Don Miguel Ruiz, a modern book about an ancestral philosophy and ancient wisdom that offers helpful and simple guidelines for living that have long inspired me.</p>
<p>These are stressful times, to be sure. But as Julian of Norwich wrote in the fourteenth century, “All shall be well, and all shall be well, and all manner of thing shall be well.”</p>
