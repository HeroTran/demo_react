<p>Oftentimes I wonder what life would be like without bipolar disorder, how supremely different everything would be had I not been so constantly followed by this condition and the interruptions it incurs. Since there is no actual way to change the past, nor does it seem likely there will be an ultimate cure in the future, I must learn how to adjust to the disorder so it won’t consume me. At times I have to dance with the devil to truly regain control of myself, and such a dance is exhausting.</p>
<p><i>I’d say at present my dance with the devil is at a somewhat lingering interlude. These so-called interludes in our dances often evoke depression more than any glimmer of long-term stability and, worse, a sense of being incomplete without the false feelings of elation and security that usually follow my mania in the heights of our days-long dances.</i></p>
<p>How, then, does this interlude differ from the ones before? How can I utilize this time of separation to better prepare myself for the dances that are surely yet to come?</p>
<p>I come to it with new eyes set on understanding the present and planning for the future rather than languishing in the fictitious glory of the past. Although many would argue I am still in the first chapters of my life with much to look forward to and much to live for, I understand that I will always be living alongside my bipolar—and I project the only way to live robustly in spite of it is to know exactly how it operates within me.</p>
<p><i>I know that mental illness touches each person uniquely. In many ways, you must be the master teacher of your dance to ever gain control over its intermittent appearances in your life.</i></p>
<p>Of course the right combination of medication can help greatly in subduing the ravages of a manic or depressive episode, but it certainly does not cure bipolar in and of itself; it only affords an opportunity of clarity where one can begin to adjust to the realities of living with a chronic condition. Having experienced the effects of mania even while medicated has convinced me that medication alone does not always guarantee that an episode won’t manifest itself once again.</p>
<p>The intervals during which I am more or less continually stable can last for months and years, yet there seems to be a climbing apex during the times of stability, as if every stressor I have is subconsciously banked into my psyche, building over time until the accumulated effects become unmanageable.</p>
<p><i>Even if the stress was processed properly during the instance it occurred, it’s as if the process of processing any emotion adds fuel to the fire of my illness, as if there is a limited amount of time or experiences I can have until the next unexpected flare-up comes and my dance with the devil begins again.</i></p>
<p>As I progress in my understanding of the condition and how it affects me, I have found it necessary to truly learn to live alongside it: even in instances of its presumed absence, I must always be aware that its influences still persist in one way or another.</p>
<p><i>I guess the point is not to attempt to destroy the illness but rather to come to know how it is a part of me without letting it dictate the steps of the dance.</i></p>
<p>It is tempting to want to forget the existence of one’s bipolar disorder during the times in which it appears to be managed and under control, yet it is at these very times that it must not be forgotten but rather remembered and understood through self-reflection. I would dare say those of us living alongside bipolar disorder are touched in a way that causes us to feel the extremes of beauty and pain to an unmanageable level; the diagnosis at some point must be embraced as an integral piece of our personality before it can be mastered. We must learn to dance with the devil that is our illness if we are ever to find the possibility of the positive to emerge from the struggle.</p>
