<p>But how much ray time do you need to meet your “D” needs? Experts say that <b>10-15 minutes of sun exposure on your bare skin</b> does the trick for most of us.</p>
<p>You can also supplement with <b>vitamins</b> and <b>through your diet</b>, eating foods such as salmon, tuna, eggs and fortified milk.</p>
<p>The sunshine vitamin has myriad benefits—including helping us maintain healthy bones and teeth—so consult your doctor if you’re concerned you’re not getting enough.</p>

<h2><b>Notifications no more</b></h2><p>“In the contemporary struggle for concentration, notifications aren’t just low-hanging fruit; they’re fruit-that long ago fell to the ground and now lie rotting.... To live with frequent notifications is to outsource decisions about the allocation of your attention to a vast committee of friends, colleagues and strangers, most of whom have no incentive to put your interests first: they want an answer to their email right now - or more engagement for their app.”</p>
<p><b>—Oliver Burkeman, columnist for the </b><b><i>Guardian</i></b><b>, calling on us to enjoy fewer distractions by turning off our phone’s email, social media and app-generated notifications. </b></p>

    </div><h2><b>Count your blessings</b></h2><p><b>Science has shown that an attitude of gratitude can make us happier, but a recent study shows that expressing it face-to-face is more beneficial still.</b></p>
<p>Psychologists at the University of Limerick found that participants who kept a gratitude journal and then, each week, offered an in-person thanks to someone in it fared better than participants who only wrote in a gratitude journal or those who journaled about their day.</p>
<p>Specifically, the gratitude-expressing group experienced the biggest decrease in negative emotions while feeling less depressed and more emotionally balanced.</p>
<p><b>Have you thanked anyone today? </b></p>
