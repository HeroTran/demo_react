I first started covering assistive technology back in the 1990s at Computer Shopper, the 1,000-plus-page bible for direct PC sales. The topic was important to me, so I snuck coverage into the advertising-heavy magazine’s voluminous back pages.</p>\n<p>Since then, though, the definition of assistive technology has changed a lot. The voice-driven interfaces that were a pipe dream in the 1990s, for instance, are now built into smartphones that are given away for free with a two-year service contract.</p>\n<p>And new challenges have emerged, too: Touch-centered interfaces are wonderful, but they are distinctly unhelpful to the blind.</p>\n<p>Our cover story shows how far we have come—and how far we have yet to go.</p>\n<p>One of the technologies discussed in the story is Aira, a service that works with Google Glass and other video-streaming devices to give the visually impaired real-time assistance. For a few hundred dollars a month, a blind person can have a sighted person on call to help them navigate the world. The camera transmits a view of their surroundings, and agents respond with directions and advice.</p>\n<p>This technology isn’t cutting-edge; it’s basically a Google Glass–enabled helpdesk. But it opens up new frontiers for its users. And it wouldn’t have been possible until relatively recently.</p>\n<p>Oddly enough, this was the second time in recent weeks that I’ve seen Google Glass changing someone’s life. At SXSW, I interviewed Thad Starner, the Director of the College of Computing at Georgia Tech. Thad has been wearing a computer since the early 1990s and is currently a devoted Google Glass user.</p>\n<p>As I interviewed Thad, he used Glass to read his notes and research answers in real time. He isn’t disabled, but he was undoubtedly assisted by the technology he was wearing on his face—no human can have that kind of total recall. And as we age, we are all going to need some kind of memory augmentation to keep up.</p>\n<p>Indeed, we could all use a little help with something, albeit some more than others. And thanks to technology, there has never been a better time to get that help.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0005-0110/146127-1-eng-US/f0005-012.jpg\" width=\"912\" height=\"291\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0005-01\" title=\"f0005-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p><b><a href=\"mailto:dan_costa@pcmag.com\" target=\"_self\">dan_costa@pcmag.com</a></b></p>\n","layout":{"portrait":{"id":"am-rs-portrait-5","link":"first_word.twig"}},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":0,"link_source":"","competition":[],"flatplan_title":"","notes":"","gutter_credit":"","other":"","image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1493839850.8813","name":"f0004-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0004-0123/146134-1-eng-US/f0004-012.jpg?t=default_ipad_portrait&ext/f0004-012_default_ipad_portrait.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"768","height":"757","legacy_id":"12175","is_default":true},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1493839850.8813","name":"f0004-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0004-0123/146134-1-eng-US/f0004-012.jpg?t=default_ipad_landscape&ext/f0004-012_default_ipad_landscape.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"779","height":"768","legacy_id":"12175","is_default":false}],"related_objects":{"image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_1_1493839849.9402","name":"f0005-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0005-0110/146127-1-eng-US/f0005-012.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"912","height":"291","legacy_id":"12174"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_1_1493839849.9402","name":"f0005-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0005-0110/146127-1-eng-US/f0005-012.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"912","height":"291","legacy_id":"12174"}]},"url_alias":"http://pcmagazine-us.audiencemedia.com","type":"story","order":"0","folio_number":"4","folio_numbers":"4,5","pdf_page_index":"4","thumbnail":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0004-0123/146134-1-eng-US/f0004-012.jpg?t=tablet_story_thumbnail&ext/f0004-012_tablet_story_thumbnail.jpg","color":"FFFFFF","real_id":"12173","main_section_id":"852","ads":[]},{"id":"zinio_253_100340926_1493839852.2749","title":"Do Robots and AI Deserve Rights?","sub_title":"","author":[{"id":"0","name":"","email":"noreply@audiencemedia.com","is_default":false}],"tag":"","strap_line":"READER INPUT / YOUR COMMENTS","intro":"When it comes to the question of how we interact with our creations, maybe should we be less concerned with determining their personhood than we are with defining our own humanity.","body":"\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0006-0124/146163-1-eng-US/f0006-012.jpg\" width=\"536\" height=\"545\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0006-01\" title=\"f0006-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>For me, when AI [artificial intelligence] is sufficient and able to think for itself, then yes, it will deserve rights.

I tend to open a document and then immediately hit some keys—perhaps Alt+W, E to view in draft mode, or Ctrl+F to find something. These commands are ignored because of the “Pick up...” offer. It’s seriously annoying. And I finally figured out how to kill it!</p>\n<p>Launch REGEDIT and navigate to the key HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Office\\16.0\\Word\\Reading Locations. Delete every single subkey; each of them is the where-you-left-off information for a different document.</p>\n<p>Now right-click the Reading Locations key and choose Permissions. Click the button labeled Advanced. Near the bottom of the resulting window you’ll find a button labeled Disable inheritance. Click that, and click OK repeatedly. You’ve ensured that Word can’t create any more of those remembered pick-up points.</p>\n<p>If at some point you want to re-enable that feature, just follow the same instructions, but click the Enable inheritance button.</p>\n<p><i>—Neil Rubenking, PCMag lead analyst for security</i></p>\n<h3><b>Ask us a question!</b></h3><p>Have a question about a story in<i>PC Magazine</i>, one of the products we cover, or how to better use a tech product you own?

That’s misleading. For years now, we’ve been assuming that all mobile phone screens come in a 16:9 aspect ratio. So when we consider screen sizes, we discuss diagonals, which make sense intuitively.</p>\n<p>This year Samsung, LG, and maybe Apple are screwing all of that up. They’re doing it for a good cause: By building taller, narrower screens, they give you more screen real estate in a hand-friendly form factor. But that means the tall, narrow Galaxy S8, LG G6, and (maybe) iPhone 8 “diagonals” don’t represent the same amount of screen area as they would on a 16:9 phone. That makes comparisons misleading.</p>\n<p>So I propose a new phone screen measurement: square inches of display, or SQUID. Aside from having an awesome acronym, SQUID tells you how much display you’re really getting, whether it’s on a 16:9, 18:9, 21:9, or 4:3 screen.</p>\n<p>You can calculate SQUID given a screen’s diagonal measurement and aspect ratio. Here’s the basic formula:</p>\n<p>SQUID = (diag^2)*xratio*yratio</p>\n<p>----------------------</p>\n<p>(xratio^2) + (yratio^2)</p>\n<h3><b>@saschasegan</b></h3><p>Using SQUID, we find that the Galaxy S8’s 5.8-inch screen actually has less area than the Galaxy Note 7’s 5.7-inch screen did. And if Apple goes to an 18:9 ratio for its rumored 5.15-inch iPhone 8, well, that will be a similar size to 5-inch, 16:9 phones.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0023-0123/146421-1-eng-US/f0023-012.jpg\" width=\"884\" height=\"865\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0023-01\" title=\"f0023-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div>\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0023-027/146414-1-eng-US/f0023-022.jpg\" width=\"1308\" height=\"281\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0023-02\" title=\"f0023-02\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>SQUID makes an even bigger difference on bigger screens, such as those of laptops, tablets, and monitors. You’ll find those in 16:9, 16:10, 4:3, 3:2, and even 21:9 aspect ratios. Watch how the SQUID changes for a “14-inch” screen in each of those aspect ratios. Between the two most popular, 16:9 and 16:10, you lose five square inches of screen space. And wow, do those “cinema-wide” 21:9 displays have to be wider on the diagonal to give you the same real estate you’d get with another aspect ratio.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0024-0122/146407-1-eng-US/f0024-012.jpg\" width=\"1294\" height=\"420\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0024-01\" title=\"f0024-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>Listen, I can’t make SQUID happen. But the way we measure things does change. Carriers moved away from two-year contracts, and now we actually talk about full phone prices—that’s been a big, positive change with time. And I like to think that as processor megahertz have become less relevant, we discuss them less often, although foolish folk still seem to be attached to nearly meaningless core counts and megahertz numbers.</p>\n<p>SQUID might catch on if I can convince other leading journalists, though.

Companies such as Motorola and Asus have developed products that use a smartphone as the core CPU tethered to a laptop shell, but none really took off. And if a recent patent is any indication, Apple also has at least a passing interest in the concept.</p>\n<p>But a new product introduced by Samsung is one of the best solutions I have seen to date. The DeX is a dock that allows the new Galaxy S8 or S8+ smartphones serve as a PC CPU. The DeX has multiple ports for linking to a TV, monitor, printer, or other USB-supported device, and Bluetooth support.</p>\n<p>In this scenario, you just pop your S8 or S8+ into the DeX cradle for the full PC experience. The OS is Android with a UI modified for the big screen.</p>\n<p>What makes this more feasible than something like Motorola’s Atrix concept from 2011 is the growing power of today’s mobile processors. Of course, a PC processor can still deliver a better computing experience, but smartphone and tablet processors can now handle a number of everyday productivity tasks. The DeX simply takes that power and puts it on a bigger screen.</p>\n<h3><b>@Bajarin</b></h3><p>I believe the DeX has some interesting potential. In fact, I think it might strike a nerve with many mobile workers whose smartphone is at the center of their business and personal lives today.</p>\n<p>I know this concept is a bit radical, and may not have enough power to deliver the desktop-like experience many people need. But when it comes to extending the role of a smartphone in the lives of mobile business users, DeX is an intriguing alternative to lugging around heavy gadgets.</p>\n<p><b><a href=\"mailto:tim_bajarin@pcmag.com\" target=\"_self\">tim_bajarin@pcmag.com</a></b></p>\n","layout":{},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":0,"link_source":"","competition":[],"flatplan_title":"","notes":"","gutter_credit":"","other":"","image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1493839878.862","name":"f0025-01","source":"","caption":"<p><b>Tim Bajarin is the president of Creative Strategies and a consultant, analyst, and futurist covering personal computers and consumer technology.</b></p>\n","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0025-0118/146457-1-eng-US/f0025-012.jpg?t=default_ipad_portrait&ext/f0025-012_default_ipad_portrait.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"768","height":"761","legacy_id":"12212","is_default":true},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1493839878.862","name":"f0025-01","source":"","caption":"<p><b>Tim Bajarin is the president of Creative Strategies and a consultant, analyst, and futurist covering personal computers and consumer technology.</b></p>\n","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0025-0118/146457-1-eng-US/f0025-012.jpg?t=default_ipad_landscape&ext/f0025-012_default_ipad_landscape.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"775","height":"768","legacy_id":"12212","is_default":false}],"url_alias":"http://pcmagazine-us.audiencemedia.com","type":"story","order":"8","folio_number":"25","folio_numbers":"25,26","pdf_page_index":"25","thumbnail":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0025-0118/146457-1-eng-US/f0025-012.jpg?t=tablet_story_thumbnail&ext/f0025-012_tablet_story_thumbnail.jpg","color":"FFFFFF","real_id":"12211","main_section_id":"852","ads":[]},{"id":"zinio_253_100340926_1493839880.201","title":"Silicon Valley Tops Detroit at Autonomous Cars?

Just as tech companies have reinvented (dare we say, disrupted?) everything from telephones to how we consume music, the thinking goes, so too will they leave traditional automakers in the dust when it comes to autonomous cars.</p>\n<p>While it’s true that Google, Uber, Tesla, and others have spurred normally slow-moving automakers into action on autonomous technology, research released in April indicates that incumbents in the auto industry are way ahead of their Silicon Valley challengers. And this gap will only widen once robo-taxis take over.</p>\n<p>Navigant Research’s Leaderboard Report ranked 18 companies that are developing self-driving technology by breaking their progress into 10 different categories, including strategy, manufacturing, and execution. Navigant then gave each of the self-driving contenders an overall score based on each of these criteria to determine where each company pursuing autonomous technology now stands.</p>\n<h3><b>@dougnewcomb</b></h3><p>Detroit stalwarts Ford and General Motors topped the list at numbers one and two, respectively, followed by Renault-Nissan in third place and Mercedes-Benz parent company Daimler in fourth. Alphabet subsidiary Waymo doesn’t appear until number 7, and it shares that slot with Volvo and its autonomous technology partners. Tesla doesn’t even make the top 10, while Uber comes in at number 16, three places from bottom-ranked Baidu, China’s version of Google.</p>\n<h3><b>UNDISPUTED TRUTH</b></h3><p>The reason automakers top tech firms, according to Navigant, is pretty basic: building cars is more complex than producing apps or smartphones.</p>\n<p>Waymo may have superior technology compared to automakers, “but they will have to do deals with someone to get actual vehicles,” Sam Abuelsamid, a senior Navigant research analyst and one of the authors of the report, told tech website The Verge in an email.</p>\n<p>And if cash-rich Alphabet doesn’t have the resources to produce cars, Silicon Valley startups like nuTonomy (ranked number 17, right above Baidu) are out of luck. “If they have something good to offer, their best bet is an acquisition,” Abuelsamid said, which has actually been a pretty lucrative path for some startups these days.</p>\n<p>Navigant’s assessment also bodes well for automakers as they shift from selling sheet metal to mobility services such as ridesharing. It’s no secret that Uber wants to replace its human drivers with self-driving tech—and in the process, substantially boost its bottom line.</p>\n<p>Ford has promised to mass produce self-driving cars that, like Google’s autonomous pod concept, won’t have a steering wheel or brake pedals and are specifically designed for ridesharing purposes. It doesn’t take a genius to figure out that GM’s $1 billion acquisition of Cruise Automation and half-billion-dollar investment in Lyft last year is leading the automaker down a similar path. And recently, Mercedes and Bosch partnered to make robo-taxis a reality by the beginning of the next decade.</p>\n<p class=\"pullQuote\"><b>Companies that some in Silicon Valley have dismissed as dinosaurs will likely not only survive but thrive.</b></p>\n<p>“It’s far easier for a manufacturer to replicate the sort of logistics platform that Uber or Lyft have than it is for those companies to invest in and create the development, manufacturing, and service infrastructure that automakers have,” Abuelsamid noted. “That’s exactly what’s already happening, as all the leading OEMs have already invested in or are developing their own services.”</p>\n<p>So don’t count Detroit (and Stuttgart) out. Companies that some in Silicon Valley have dismissed as dinosaurs will likely not only survive but thrive in the next era of personal mobility.</p>\n<p><b><a href=\"mailto:doug_newcomb@pcmag.com\" target=\"_self\">doug_newcomb@pcmag.com</a></b></p>\n","layout":{},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":0,"link_source":"","competition":[],"flatplan_title":"","notes":"","gutter_credit":"","other":"","image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1493839880.2968","name":"f0027-01","source":"","caption":"<p><b>Car tech expert Doug Newcomb has written for Popular Mechanics, Road &amp; Track, and other publications, and is the author of Car Audio for Dummies.</b></p>\n","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0027-0120/146486-1-eng-US/f0027-012.jpg?t=default_ipad_portrait&ext/f0027-012_default_ipad_portrait.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"768","height":"750","legacy_id":"12215","is_default":true},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1493839880.2968","name":"f0027-01","source":"","caption":"<p><b>Car tech expert Doug Newcomb has written for Popular Mechanics, Road &amp; Track, and other publications, and is the author of Car Audio for Dummies.</b></p>\n","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0027-0120/146486-1-eng-US/f0027-012.jpg?t=default_ipad_landscape&ext/f0027-012_default_ipad_landscape.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"786","height":"768","legacy_id":"12215","is_default":false}],"url_alias":"http://pcmagazine-us.audiencemedia.com","type":"story","order":"9","folio_number":"27","folio_numbers":"27,28,29","pdf_page_index":"27","thumbnail":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0027-0120/146486-1-eng-US/f0027-012.jpg?t=tablet_story_thumbnail&ext/f0027-012_tablet_story_thumbnail.jpg","color":"FFFFFF","real_id":"12214","main_section_id":"852","ads":[]},{"id":"zinio_253_100340926_1493840009.8529","title":"Windows 10: It’s a Miracle (That It Works)","sub_title":"","author":[{"id":"0","name":"JOHN C.

This suit, which amounts to only $5 million so far, could easily turn into a massive class-action suit if Microsoft can’t counter the threat by finding something in its end-user license agreement (EULA) that holds the company blameless. If that doesn’t work, it could finally kill off the onerous EULA and open the gates to lawsuits against every software company, website, cloud service, and everything in between.</p>\n<p>I’ve never been a fan of the EULA, but I see its value from the corporate perspective. It keeps these companies in business, because it underscores that nothing software-based actually works as it is supposed to. There is always a glitch, flaw, or security risk.</p>\n<p>What has changed over the years is auto-upgrades. This option has been a holy grail for Microsoft since the appearance of America Online. AOL used to just auto-upgrade your entire online system every so often, whether you liked it or not. It would change the whole experience and interface.</p>\n<p>Microsoft and other software companies wanted this freedom, but two things prevented it. The first was that Microsoft’s pre-testing was never perfect; when it put a patch into the field, the patch would often fail or even make things worse. The second problem was squawking from users who never trusted Microsoft’s patches, until the patch for the patch arrived.</p>\n<h3><b>@ THErealDVORAK</b></h3><p>There are millions of lines of code in Windows, and—like most software—much of it has devolved into spaghetti code that was installed over the years to fix bugs. Microsoft is sick of doling out customer support for someone running old Windows 8 code. Thus, it decided to upgrade everyone to Windows 10. Almost all Windows users—400 million at this point, according to Redmond—are running the same code base.</p>\n<p>I have had no problems with Windows 10. I like it. I particularly like the speedy reboot times. I had two PCs that were auto-upgraded months apart. My Windows 7 machine updated first, then the Windows 8.1 system. But despite this “consistent code,” the presentation of Windows 10 on the two machines has differences.</p>\n<p>Auto-updates will cause more problems in the future. At some point (and it better be working on this now), Microsoft must abandon Windows altogether and code something fresh and modern.</p>\n<p>For instance, I have never understood why it can’t get rid of the idiotic registry. Why does a software package need to be “installed?” There are plenty of systems that simply run within a closed framework that can be contained within one directory. The registry stems from the eye-rolling notion that different software subsystems can intertwine, and there needs to be a common area for streamlined coordination. The convoluted registry is only one facet of this. You’ll find all sorts of hidden directories and “temp file” holding areas used for one function or another. AppData, a hidden folder, is a good example of this.</p>\n<p class=\"pullQuote\"><b>Nothing software-based actually works as it’s supposed to. There is always a glitch, flaw, or security risk.</b></p>\n<p>The interaction between programs, as promised in the 1980s, means you could send out a DOC file that had some spreadsheet summary data in it and could change automatically as the information on the linked spreadsheet did real-time re-calc. Data all over the place here and there would alter itself.</p>\n<p>This idea has a lot of applications, such as doing a mail merge, or collecting stock market data, and changing the price dynamically. But does this require a burdensome registry?</p>\n<p>When I use any of my Windows 10 machines, I have to admit that it is a miracle to me that they work at all, especially when I consider what is going on under the buggy surface.
