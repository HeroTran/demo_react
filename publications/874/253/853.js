Nobody can accuse Mr. Musk of a lack of intellectual diversity in his pursuits, which have ranged from glitzy solar roof tiles to cartoonishly fast cars, colonizing other planets, and domestic energy infrastructure. He’s someone who thinks in the future tense. And he clearly believes that AI is the future.</p>\n<p>As AI advances, humans will have to find a comfortable coexistence with machines that learn or risk winding up as “house cats” to intelligence beyond ours. Toward that goal, and with a happy side effect of therapeutic benefits for certain brain disorders, Elon Musk has been funding a company called Neuralink that wants to implant an AI interface in your brain.</p>\n<p>The company is currently working with syringe-injectable, flexible, sub-micron-thickness substrates (note the regular grid in the ribbon pictured below) that can function as a component of implantable electronics. The mesh is so gossamer-soft that it doesn’t irritate the brain’s impossibly delicate cellular matrix, and its electrical properties mean that only the target part of the brain receives the electrical stimulus. With recent developments in flexible electronics and bio-inert materials, implantable brain-computer interfaces are coming closer and closer to reality every day.</p>\n<p>It has to be stressed here that brain implants are not a casual undertaking. The people who resort to implanted electrodes and the like are people who have no other options. They suffer from degenerative brain diseases, have intractable problems that they can’t solve by any means other than creating a hole in their braincase that incidentally gives the outside microbiome direct access to the brain. Just what you wanted: a hole in your head that only the most intrepid bacteria can get through. Those brain-eating amoeba are going to think these implants are so cool.</p>\n<p class=\"pullQuote\"><b>Humans will have to find a comfortable coexistence with machines that learn or risk winding up as “house cats.”</b></p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0009-0118/146192-1-eng-US/f0009-012.jpg\" width=\"800\" height=\"374\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0009-01\" title=\"f0009-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>BRAIN MESH</b></p>\n<p><b>Neural lace threaded through a glass needle is soft enough not to irritate the brain’s cellular matrix.</b></p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>Neuralink has been registered in California as a medical research company as of last July, although to date it’s had no public presence whatsoever. The injectable implants are its platform, and it’s working on therapeutic applications for people with brain diseases. But the implants aren’t just limited to treating problems. At last year’s Vox Media Code Conference, Musk talked about his ideas for the company’s future in AI-enabled brain-computer interfaces. It’s critically important to him that machine intelligence remains under our control and aligned with our goals, and to assure that outcome, Musk wants to implant an AI “layer” in people’s brains. “If we can create a high-bandwidth neural interface with your digital self, then you’re no longer a house cat,” he said.</p>\n<p>Neuralink isn’t starting from scratch in this endeavor — it’ll start with established brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). We have already advanced technology to the point that we can remotely control the motion of rats, allow locked-in ALS patients a “voice” (in early trials), pilot brain-controlled prostheses, and wire up prosthetic lower limbs that can be controlled directly by the brain as well. All of these technologies are, at best, in the early stages of commercialization and research, but Neuralink hopes to move beyond them in a matter of years. Musk told Vanity Fair that we “are already cyborgs” and that he believes a meaningful brain interface is just 4 to 5 years away.</p>\n<p>Am I the only one who has a distinct vision of a solar-shingled Wisteria Lane lookalike cyborg housing development on Mars? There would be battery-electric Tesla cars you can drive around on the Martian surface using only your mind, and remotes to control your upgraded spouse à la The Stepford Wives. You’d upgrade your cognitive AI interface firmware on Patch Tuesday only to find that there’s a bug in the code that bricks your kids. These modern times.</p>\n<p class=\"pullQuote\"><b>It’s critically important to Musk that machine intelligence remains under our control and aligned with our goals.</b></p>\n","layout":{"portrait":{"id":"am-rs-portrait-1","link":"article_whatsnew.twig"}},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":0,"link_source":"","competition":[],"flatplan_title":"","notes":"","gutter_credit":"","other":"","image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1493839855.0823","name":"f0008-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0008-0115/146199-1-eng-US/f0008-012.jpg?t=default_ipad_portrait&ext/f0008-012_default_ipad_portrait.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"768","height":"548","legacy_id":"12182","is_default":true},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1493839855.0823","name":"f0008-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0008-0115/146199-1-eng-US/f0008-012.jpg?t=default_ipad_landscape&ext/f0008-012_default_ipad_landscape.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"1024","height":"731","legacy_id":"12182","is_default":false}],"related_objects":{"image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_1_1493839853.887","name":"f0009-01","source":"","caption":"<p><b>BRAIN MESH</b></p>\n<p><b>Neural lace threaded through a glass needle is soft enough not to irritate the brain’s cellular matrix.</b></p>\n","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0009-0118/146192-1-eng-US/f0009-012.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"800","height":"374","legacy_id":"12181"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_1_1493839853.887","name":"f0009-01","source":"","caption":"<p><b>BRAIN MESH</b></p>\n<p><b>Neural lace threaded through a glass needle is soft enough not to irritate the brain’s cellular matrix.</b></p>\n","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0009-0118/146192-1-eng-US/f0009-012.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"800","height":"374","legacy_id":"12181"}]},"url_alias":"http://pcmagazine-us.audiencemedia.com","type":"story","order":"2","folio_number":"8","folio_numbers":"8,9,10","pdf_page_index":"8","thumbnail":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0008-0115/146199-1-eng-US/f0008-012.jpg?t=tablet_story_thumbnail&ext/f0008-012_tablet_story_thumbnail.jpg","color":"FFFFFF","real_id":"12180","main_section_id":"853","ads":[]},{"id":"zinio_253_100340926_1493839856.9353","title":"The Coolest Features in Windows 10 Creators Update","sub_title":"","author":[{"id":"0","name":"MICHAEL MUCHMORE","email":"noreply@audiencemedia.com","is_default":false}],"tag":"","strap_line":"WHAT’S NEW NOW / NEWS STORY","intro":"","body":"<p class=\"byline\"><b>BY MICHAEL MUCHMORE</b></p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0011-0123/146270-1-eng-US/f0011-012.jpg\" width=\"1134\" height=\"600\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0011-01\" title=\"f0011-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p><b>W</b>indows 10 is now considered by Microsoft to be a service. What that means is that the OS is continually updated with new features and fixes in small increments (such as the redesigned Photos app—see our review in this issue) and big releases. The Creators Update is the latest big one, and it starts rolling out to Windows 10 users for free on April 11.</p>\n<p>The previous major release, Anniversary Update, fine-tuned the interface and added features including Digital Ink input, more Windows Hello secure authentication possibilities, and Cortana interaction from the lock screen.</p>\n<p>This time, Creators Update does add one very creator-specific tool—the new Paint 3D—but much of what’s new concerns gaming and the web browser.

A new dedicated Gaming section graces the main Windows 10 Settings app; it lets you control the Game bar that pops up when you hit Windows key-G, your Game DVR options, and the new Broadcasting capability that comes via Beam.

The new Paint 3D app lets you build and edit 3D objects from a set of primitives and pre-built shapes and apply 2D images and textures to them. Then you can share your creations and see those from others on the <a href=\"http://Remix.com\" target=\"_self\">Remix.com</a> sharing community.

You can choose from a decent selection of e-books in the Windows Store app, and the reader has all the functions we’ve become accustomed to and then some. You access your bookshelf from the Favorites/History button. The reader not only shows table of contents and formatting options but also can actually read your book aloud.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0013-025/146242-1-eng-US/f0013-022.jpg\" width=\"740\" height=\"569\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0013-02\" title=\"f0013-02\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>NIGHT LIGHT</b></h3><p>The blue part of the spectrum emitted by displays has been found to interfere with sleep, and for that reason Apple introduced Night Shift in iOS 9.3. Now Windows users can benefit from de-blued screens in the evening, thanks to the Night Light setting in Creators Update. It defaults to turning on at sunset, but you can configure custom hours and even set the color temperature.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0014-0121/146235-1-eng-US/f0014-012.jpg\" width=\"740\" height=\"527\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0014-01\" title=\"f0014-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>NEW PRIVACY DASHBOARD AND SETUP</b></h3><p>Microsoft took a lot of heat for its data collection in Windows 10, even though it was no more invasive than that in Apple and Google’s software, which can’t work without an account, as Windows can. Starting with Windows 10, privacy setup options are much clearer, and now there’s an online Privacy dashboard at <a href=\"http://account.microsoft.com/privacy\" target=\"_self\">account.microsoft.com/privacy</a> that lets you see what data Microsoft saves to the cloud and lets you clear search history, location data, and more.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0014-024/146228-1-eng-US/f0014-022.jpg\" width=\"740\" height=\"493\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0014-02\" title=\"f0014-02\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>MOVIES &amp; TV APP UPDATES</b></h3><p>The Movies &amp; TV app not only lets you play content you’ve bought in the Windows Store but also serves as a player for your own videos.

The software giant is already working with several businesses to populate Marketplace but said anyone with a registered business can apply.</p>\n<p>“The idea is to give Minecraft creators another way to make a living from the game, allowing them to support themselves in the creation of ever-greater projects, while giving Pocket and Windows 10 players access to a growing catalogue of fun stuff — curated and supplied by us, safely and simply,” Microsoft wrote. “And, of course, you can still manually download free community creations you’ve found out there on the internet, too.”</p>\n<p>The new in-game currency is called Minecraft Coins. You purchase it inside the game store with real money and use it to buy content in the Marketplace. “You won’t see any creator content in the beta, but we’ll add that when we launch later in Spring,” the company wrote.</p>\n<p class=\"pullQuote\"><b>The Market-place will be packed with “adventure maps, texture packs, minigames,” and other goodies.</b></p>\n","layout":{},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":0,"link_source":"","competition":[],"flatplan_title":"","notes":"","gutter_credit":"","other":"","image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1493839864.9611","name":"f0015-01","source":"","caption":"<p><b>FOR SALE BY OWNER</b></p>\n<p><b>With Minecraft Marketplace, Pocket and Windows 10 players will be able to browse, download, and play community creations, right from within the game.</b></p>\n","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0015-0125/146299-1-eng-US/f0015-012.jpg?t=default_ipad_portrait&ext/f0015-012_default_ipad_portrait.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"768","height":"498","legacy_id":"12194","is_default":true},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1493839864.9611","name":"f0015-01","source":"","caption":"<p><b>FOR SALE BY OWNER</b></p>\n<p><b>With Minecraft Marketplace, Pocket and Windows 10 players will be able to browse, download, and play community creations, right from within the game.</b></p>\n","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0015-0125/146299-1-eng-US/f0015-012.jpg?t=default_ipad_landscape&ext/f0015-012_default_ipad_landscape.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"1024","height":"664","legacy_id":"12194","is_default":false}],"url_alias":"http://pcmagazine-us.audiencemedia.com","type":"story","order":"4","folio_number":"15","folio_numbers":"15,16","pdf_page_index":"15","thumbnail":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0015-0125/146299-1-eng-US/f0015-012.jpg?t=tablet_story_thumbnail&ext/f0015-012_tablet_story_thumbnail.jpg","color":"FFFFFF","real_id":"12193","main_section_id":"853","ads":[]},{"id":"zinio_253_100340926_1493839866.541","title":"IoT Botnet Mirai Now Forces Smart Appliances to Mine Bitcoin","sub_title":"","author":[{"id":"0","name":"JOEL HRUSKA","email":"noreply@audiencemedia.com","is_default":false}],"tag":"","strap_line":"WHAT’S NEW NOW / NEWS STORY","intro":"","body":"<p class=\"byline\"><b>BY JOEL HRUSKA</b></p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0017-0122/146335-1-eng-US/f0017-012.jpg\" width=\"796\" height=\"929\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0017-01\" title=\"f0017-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p><b>E</b>arlier this year, I declared the Internet of Things had officially hit peak stupid, courtesy of a new smart toaster being shown at CES. I should have known better. What’s even more useless than a smart toaster? A smart toaster that’s been hacked to mine Bitcoin.</p>\n<p>This is a concept as incomprehensible as it is stupid. Seven years ago, mining bitcoins on CPUs was totally a thing people did. Six years ago, GPUs such as AMD’s HD 5000 series were tearing up the hash charts. Four to five years ago, you could still earn some money mining on GPUs, but the specter of custom-built ASICs was rising, and those offer performance benefits no GPU could compete with.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0018-0126/146328-1-eng-US/f0018-012.jpg\" width=\"850\" height=\"490\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0018-01\" title=\"f0018-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>BUSYBOX</b></p>\n<p><b>IBM’s X-Force picked up a surge in Mirai with Bitcoin mining baked in.</b></p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>According to IBM’s X-Force initiative, there was a brief spike in a specific variant of Mirai that carries a cryptocurrency mining payload, possibly deployed as a proof-of-concept solution. Here’s how X-Force describes the Bitcoin-mining version:</p>\n<p><i>What we found when we dissected the Mirai sample was pretty much the same Mirai functionality ported over from the Windows version with a focus on attacking Linux machines running BusyBox. This software provides several stripped-down Unix tools in a single executable file and digital video recording (DVR) servers. BusyBox utilizes Telnet, which is targeted with a dictionary attack brute-force tool contained in the Mirai malware. The DVR servers are targeted because many of them use default Telnet credentials.</i></p>\n<p>The Telnet protocol is an attacker’s gateway to compromising IoT devices. Aside from DVRs, many embedded system applications in IoT devices, such as routers, VoIP phones, televisions, industrial control systems and others, leverage Telnet’s remote-access capabilities.</p>\n<p>IBM’s X-Force theorizes that this new approach might have been an attempt to monetize Bitcoin mining by spreading the workload out to dozens, even thousands or tens of thousands of IoT products. In principle, yes, this could work. In practice… well. It probably wouldn’t.</p>\n<h3><b>WHAT’S THE HASH RATE ON A MICROCONTROLLER?</b></h3><p>Over the last few years, people have made something of a game out of mining bitcoins on unusual bits of hardware. We’ve seen bitcoin mined via pen and paper and on an ancient IBM 1401. But there’s something about trying to mine BTC on a toaster, wireless light bulb, dildo camera, baby monitor, wine bottle, and/or humidifier that’s particularly pathetic.</p>\n<p>For one thing, the CPU power packed into this equipment isn’t simply less than you’d get from an Intel Core i7 or AMD Ryzen 5 or 7—it’s dramatically less. A single-core Cortex-A8 running at 800MHz to 1GHz would be terrible compared with even a low-end CPU (the Bitcoin article on this topic suggests a hash rate of 0.12MHash/s to 0.2MHash/s for the Cortex-A8 and 0.57 for the Cortex A9). Imagine trying this with a Cortex-M3 or M4-class processor, which offer significantly less performance than their Cortex counterparts.</p>\n<p>Now, add the fact that a Cortex-A8 is still a high-end CPU by the standards of a lot of embedded products. You’re not going to get much call for an ARM-optimized Bitcoin client capable of toasting and hashing. Whatever bright bulb tried to create this solution will find himself painstakingly writing a lot of hand-tuned code to execute BTC operations “optimally” on ancient hardware.</p>\n<p>We suspect the reason IBM saw a steep drop-off in Mirai’s BTC client is because it’s just too damn hard to get bitcoins out of your microwave. Best to let the Internet of Things focus on what it does best—destroying perfectly useful products, stuffing landfills with insane amounts of plastic garbage, and making no one’s life better, ever.</p>\n","layout":{},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":0,"link_source":"","competition":[],"flatplan_title":"","notes":"","gutter_credit":"","other":"","image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1493839868.0325","name":"f0017-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0017-0122/146335-1-eng-US/f0017-012.jpg?t=default_ipad_portrait&ext/f0017-012_default_ipad_portrait.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"768","height":"896","legacy_id":"12198","is_default":true},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1493839868.0325","name":"f0017-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0017-0122/146335-1-eng-US/f0017-012.jpg?t=default_ipad_landscape&ext/f0017-012_default_ipad_landscape.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"658","height":"768","legacy_id":"12198","is_default":false}],"related_objects":{"image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_1_1493839866.6482","name":"f0018-01","source":"","caption":"<p><b>BUSYBOX</b></p>\n<p><b>IBM’s X-Force picked up a surge in Mirai with Bitcoin mining baked in.</b></p>\n","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0018-0126/146328-1-eng-US/f0018-012.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"850","height":"490","legacy_id":"12197"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_1_1493839866.6482","name":"f0018-01","source":"","caption":"<p><b>BUSYBOX</b></p>\n<p><b>IBM’s X-Force picked up a surge in Mirai with Bitcoin mining baked in.</b></p>\n","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0018-0126/146328-1-eng-US/f0018-012.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"850","height":"490","legacy_id":"12197"}]},"url_alias":"http://pcmagazine-us.audiencemedia.com","type":"story","order":"5","folio_number":"17","folio_numbers":"17,18,19","pdf_page_index":"17","thumbnail":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0017-0122/146335-1-eng-US/f0017-012.jpg?t=tablet_story_thumbnail&ext/f0017-012_tablet_story_thumbnail.jpg","color":"FFFFFF","real_id":"12196","main_section_id":"853","ads":[]},{"id":"zinio_253_100340926_1493839869.4712","title":"What We Love Most This Month","sub_title":"","author":[{"id":"0","name":"PCMAG STAFF","email":"noreply@audiencemedia.com","is_default":false}],"tag":"","strap_line":"WHAT’S NEW NOW / TOP GEAR","intro":"","body":"<p class=\"byline\"><b>BY PCMAG STAFF</b></p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0020-0125/146378-1-eng-US/f0020-012.jpg\" width=\"1604\" height=\"1055\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0020-01\" title=\"f0020-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>MICROSOFT PROJECT SCORPIO</b></h3><p><b>Ready for the future of gaming?
