That’s an impressive feat for a smartphone with a 5.7-inch display. In addition, the $650 G6 includes many of the features we liked about LG’s previous flagships, such as dual rear camera sensors, while adding new elements like a waterproof build and an HDR screen. The question is whether that’s enough to break through, especially with powerful contenders such as the Samsung Galaxy S8. The G6 is the best phone LG has released to date, but we think it’s worth waiting to see what’s just around the bend.</p>\n<h3><b>PRICING, DESIGN, AND FEATURES</b></h3><p>The G6 varies in price depending on your carrier. T-Mobile—the carrier we tested on—is the most affordable at $650. Verizon is a bit pricier at $672, with Sprint and AT&amp;T coming in at $708 and $720 respectively.</p>\n<p>The G6 is an unusually long, narrow phone, with slim bezels and a 2:1 (LG says 18:9) screen aspect ratio. Metal sides combine with a pleasantly grippy glass back that won’t easily slip out of your hand, though the black model we reviewed picks up fingerprints and smudges easily. It should be a bit less noticeable on the silver (LG calls it Ice Platinum) model.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0031-0115/146557-1-eng-US/f0031-012.jpg\" width=\"1454\" height=\"705\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0031-01\" title=\"f0031-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>STILL, TRY NOT TO DROP IT...</b></p>\n<p><b>The rounded metal corners of the phone spread shock, helping to make it more resistant to drops.</b></p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p><b>LG G6</b></p>\n<p><b>PROS Excellent one-handed form factor. Sturdy build. Useful dual rear cameras. Crisp HDR screen. Waterproof. SD card slot.</b></p>\n<p><b>CONS Processor lags behind upcoming flagships. Screen could be brighter. Odd aspect ratio. No removable battery.</b></p>\n<p>There’s a standard headphone jack on top (the G6 doesn’t feature dual speakers or quad DACs like the LG V20), a USB-C port on the bottom, and LG’s signature power button/fingerprint scanner on the back, located under the dual camera sensors. A pair of clicky volume buttons are on the left side, while the SIM/microSD card slot on the right worked fine with a 256GB card.</p>\n<p>The phone measures 5.9 by 2.8 by 0.3 inches (HWD), weighs 5.8 ounces, and is just narrow enough to reach across with your thumb. Compared with the behemoth Google Pixel XL (6.1 by 3.0 by 0.3 inches, 5.9 ounces) and the even heavier iPhone 7 Plus (6.2 by 3.1 by 0.3 inches, 6.6 ounces), the G6 is much easier to use with one hand.</p>\n<p>It’s just a touch wider and slightly heavier than the Galaxy S8 (5.9 by 2.7 by 0.3, 5.5 ounces), which squeezes a 5.8-inch, 18.5:9-screen into its frame. Despite the similar dimensions, the S8 feels a bit easier to grip thanks to its gently curved display that better conforms to your hand. That said, both phones are sure to please fans of big screens you can comfortably hold and operate with just one hand.</p>\n<p class=\"pullQuote\"><b>There’s no carrier branding on the front or back of the LG G6, which helps it retain a clean, premium look.</b></p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0032-0111/146550-1-eng-US/f0032-012.jpg\" width=\"918\" height=\"542\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0032-01\" title=\"f0032-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>DISPLAY</b></p>\n<p><b>The LG G6 has a tall, narrow 5.7-inch LCD with a unique 2:1 aspect ratio and support for HDR (both Dolby HDR and HDR 10).</b></p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>There’s no carrier branding on the front or back of the LG G6, which helps it retain a clean, premium look. Rounded sides spread shock and give the phone some impact resistance. Like the V20, it’s rated MIL-STD-810G, meaning it can withstand drops onto hard surfaces. It survived several five-foot drops onto the rubberized floor of our test lab with no visible damage, though keep in mind if you drop it on concrete, you’re likely to crack the glass back.</p>\n<p>This is also LG’s first phone to be IP68 waterproof. We dunked it and rinsed it off in the sink without any trouble.</p>\n<h3><b>DISPLAY AND APP SCALING</b></h3><p>As touched on above, the real selling point of the G6 is its 5.7-inch, 2,880-by-1,440 LCD with a unique 2:1 aspect ratio. This means you’re looking at a tall, narrow screen. It can be disorienting at first, but you get used to it. And one nice aspect is that when multi-window multitasking, you get a lot more content with each app.</p>\n<p>The aspect ratio also means built-in apps have been altered, and there may be some compatibility issues with third-party software that isn’t properly scaled. Fortunately, in Display settings is an option for App Scaling that lets you pick between aspect ratios of 16:9 (Compatibility), 16.7:9 (Standard), and 18:9 (Full-screen). You’re likely to encounter a similar issue with the S8, which has an 18.5:9 aspect ratio.</p>\n<p>Stock apps such as the dialer, messaging app, address book, music player, weather, and email have been altered to take advantage of the increased screen real estate, usually with larger graphics toward the top of the screen. The camera also gets a bunch of new modes where the top half of the screen is a viewfinder, and the bottom half shows an image preview or lets you coordinate with another image. As the screen can be divided into two square halves, we see some real Instagram potential here.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0033-0119/146543-1-eng-US/f0033-012.jpg\" width=\"1453\" height=\"725\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0033-01\" title=\"f0033-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>APP SCALING</b></p>\n<p><b>The G6’s App Scaling option lets you choose among aspect ratios of 16:9 (Compatibility), 16.7:9 (Standard), and 18:9 (Full-screen).</b></p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>Samsung may be widely known for having the best displays on the market, but the G6 can give the S7 Edge a run for its money. The screen resolution is 565 pixels per inch (ppi), matching the sharpness of the Quad HD AMOLED panel on the 5.5-inch S7 Edge (534ppi) and Pixel XL (534ppi). But it’s not just mere pixel density that makes the G6 stand out. The phone has unusually rich colors thanks to its support for HDR (both Dolby HDR and HDR10). When you see HDR and non-HDR content side by side, the HDR really jumps out.</p>\n<p>But despite great color and viewing angles, the screen could use a bit more brightness for outdoor visibilit,y since it’s hard to see under direct sunlight. Like the LG G5, it has an “always on” mode that keeps time, date, and notifications visible when the screen is off, but it’s dimmer than Samsung’s.</p>\n<h3><b>NETWORK PERFORMANCE AND CONNECTIVITY</b></h3><p>The G6 is available on all the major US carriers. We reviewed the T-Mobile version, which supports GSM (850/900/1800/1900MHz), UMTS (1/2/4/5), and LTE bands (1/2/3/4/5/7/12/13/20/66), giving it good connectivity on T-Mobile and international roaming. We tested the phone in midtown Manhattan where we recorded a top download speed of 9Mbps and an unusually high upload speed of 28Mbps.</p>\n<p>The phone also supports dual-band Wi-Fi, NFC, and Bluetooth 4.2. The Galaxy S8 is slightly more future-proof thanks to its inclusion of Bluetooth 5.0.</p>\n<p>Call quality is acceptable. Earpiece and speakerphone volume are both loud, but calls made with the phone tend to sound a bit robotic. Noise cancellation was good at handling the sound of traffic, but struggled to blot out wind, sometimes resulting in garbled transmissions.</p>\n<h3><b>PROCESSOR AND BATTERY</b></h3><p>The G6 is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 processor clocked at 2.34GHz, rather than the newer Snapdragon 835. In terms of benchmarks, the phone performs similarly to other Snapdragon 821-powered devices, scoring 136,907 on AnTuTu, which measures overall system performance. That’s a bit lower than the Google Pixel XL (140,121), which runs a pure form of Android. It’s also lower than the OnePlus 3T (159,144), which benefits from a less-demanding 1080p screen and more RAM (6GB compared with 4GB).</p>\n<p>But the main concern here isn’t day-to-day performance, as you’re unlikely to notice a difference between the G6 and other existing flagships when it comes to multitasking or playing games like GTA: San Andreas. However, the Snapdragon 835-powered Galaxy S8 will not only offer better performance, it’ll also support, letting you take advantage of the faster networks that many carriers are in the process of rolling out.</p>\n<p>In most regards, the G6 is an improvement over the G5, but if there’s one aspect that may disappoint fans of the series, it’s the demise of the removable battery. The 3,300mAh cell in the G6 is sealed in, partly to make the phone waterproof. Thankfully, battery life is fairly solid.</p>\n<p>The G6 clocked 5 hours, 57 minutes when we streamed full-screen video over LTE at maximum brightness. It’s not as long as the Pixel XL (6 hours, 43 minutes), and falls far hours short of the S7 Edge (10 hours), but it’s a big improvement over the V20 (4 hours, 38 minutes). LG has incorporated smart charging technology, allowing the battery to better maintain its charging capacity for over two years. There’s a built-in battery-saving mode that turns off the always-on display, reduces screen brightness, and limits background data to save juice. The included adapter supports fast charging, and the phone is compatible with wireless charging pads (not included).</p>\n<p class=\"pullQuote\"><b>The 3,300mAh cell in the G6 is sealed in, partly to make the phone waterproof.

The main sensor offers a 71-degree angle, while the wide lens is 125 degrees. The phone does a smooth zoom between the two cameras, as the iPhone 7 Plus does.</p>\n<p>And as with the iPhone, the quality is striking. Unlike on other phones, you don’t lose detail when you zoom in. The price is that there’s significant barrel distortion in wide-angle shots, with straight lines appearing curved at the edges of the frame.</p>\n<p>The sensors excel outdoors. Noise is minimal, and quality compares favorably with the Google Pixel XL. Indoors, the Pixel XL has better white balance and color reproduction, taking superior shots in low light. But the G6 has manual controls, so with some tweaking of ISO and shutter speed, you can improve lower-light photos quite a bit from the default settings. The phone also records 4K video with both rear cameras.</p>\n<h3><b>SOFTWARE</b></h3><p>The G6 comes running Android 7.0 Nougat, a step behind the newer Android 7.1 you get on the Pixels. LG’s software layer is quite heavy. Colors, icons, and much of the launcher have been modified, and LG adds its own gallery and music apps in addition to Google’s options. Out of the box, the phone comes with the app drawer disabled and all of your apps strewn across the home screens, but that’s easy to change in Settings. There isn’t much in the way of useful new software features. Shortcut keys let you launch various applications by pressing the volume buttons twice, but that’s about it.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0037-0113/146522-1-eng-US/f0037-012.jpg\" width=\"1308\" height=\"687\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0037-01\" title=\"f0037-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>OVERLOADED</b></p>\n<p><b>Most carrier phones come with a plethora of preloaded apps, and the LG G6 is no exception.</b></p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>If there’s one thing we’ve come to expect from carrier phones, it’s bloatware.

Considering the S8 comes with 64GB of storage, the G6 seems a bit short on space. Of course, you can always toss in a microSD card if you need more.</p>\n<h3><b>CONCLUSIONS</b></h3><p>The LG G6 represents the refinement of ideas drawn from the company’s previous flagships. It has the dual-camera setup from the G5 and V20, but now, both sensors are of equal resolution. It has a large, gorgeous screen that you can use with one hand. It also has crowd-pleasing features such as waterproofing, drop resistance, and wireless charging. Losing out, though, are the removable-battery stalwarts, who now have no major phone makers on their side.</p>\n<p>All that said, a large, Samsung-shaped cloud looms over the G6. The Galaxy S8, which started shipping April 21, matches LG’s narrow, big-screen approach with a gorgeous curved display and throws in a Snapdragon 835 processor with gigabit LTE speeds. It also comes with a custom AI assistant, Bixby, and a small ecosystem of accessories, including Samsung Dex and the Gear VR, that give it a leg up in both productivity and multimedia. So while LG was smart to get the G6 to market ahead of the S8, it may not be enough of a head start.</p>\n<p class=\"byline\"><b>SASCHA SEGAN</b></p>\n","layout":{},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":0,"link_source":"","competition":[],"flatplan_title":"","notes":"","gutter_credit":"","other":"","image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1493839892.3267","name":"f0030-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0030-0117/146571-1-eng-US/f0030-012.jpg?t=default_ipad_portrait&ext/f0030-012_default_ipad_portrait.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"768","height":"674","legacy_id":"12226","is_default":true},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1493839892.3267","name":"f0030-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0030-0117/146571-1-eng-US/f0030-012.jpg?t=default_ipad_landscape&ext/f0030-012_default_ipad_landscape.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"874","height":"768","legacy_id":"12226","is_default":false}],"related_objects":{"image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_8_1493839881.7344","name":"f0038-01","source":"","caption":"<p><b>BRING ON THE H2O</b></p>\n<p><b>The G6—LG’s first IP68-waterproof phone—can be submerged in five feet of water for 30 minutes.

\t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>The Fitbit Alta is about as chic as fitness trackers come. And the equally chic Alta HR adds continuous heart-rate monitoring and better sleep tracking to help close the gap between it and Fitbit’s more hard-core offerings. The Alta HR gave accurate heart-rate readings and consistent step-count tracking, and it exceeded expectations for battery life in testing. It lacks some of the features of the Fitbit Charge 2, which remains our Editors’ Choice—but of all of Fitbit’s trackers, it comes closest to hitting the sweet spot between form and function.</p>\n<h3><b>WHAT’S NEW?</b></h3><p>At a glance, the Alta HR is nearly identical in design to its predecessor; after all, why fix something that isn’t broken? The bottom of the OLED screen features a small, largely unnoticeable Fitbit logo, and the strap has a slightly different textured pattern. Fitbit has done away with the prong closure found on the original for a more traditional buckle. That’s a plus for exercising, as prongs tend to become less secure over time. But it’s a little disappointing that the buckle feels like it’s one strong tug away from breaking. This might just be because of its thin design. The buckle held up over three weeks of testing, but it still doesn’t feel nearly as secure as a metal buckle.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0040-0118/146628-1-eng-US/f0040-012.jpg\" width=\"917\" height=\"575\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0040-01\" title=\"f0040-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>BUCKLING UNDER</b></p>\n<p><b>Although buckle closures last longer than prongs, this plastic one feels a little flimsy.</b></p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p><b>Fitbit Alta HR</b></p>\n<p><b>PROS Long battery life. More in-depth sleep tracking and insights over its predecessor. Accurate heart rate and step count readings. Slim and comfortable to wear 24/7 with plenty of band options.</b></p>\n<p><b>CONS Screen is occasionally unresponsive. Buckle feels a bit flimsy. No altimeter. Lacks GPS.</b></p>\n<p>Because the Alta HR hews closely to its predecessor, it retains many of the same quirks. The touch screen is finicky, for instance. You have to double tap directly in the center and with a bit more force than you might expect. Light taps and anything on the edges are unlikely to register. This isn’t unique to the Alta HR—I’ve experienced the same problem with the Charge HR and Charge 2. Eventually you grow used to it, but it can be pesky at first, especially since the Alta HR doesn’t have a button to let you cycle through the different stats it tracks.</p>\n<p>The main physical difference can be seen when you flip the tracker over: a tiny PurePulse heart rate sensor. The Alta HR is also one of the smallest fitness trackers with continuous heart rate monitoring you can get. Fitbit says it’s 25 percent slimmer than the Charge 2.</p>\n<h3><b>TAKING THE ALTA HR FOR A SPIN</b></h3><p>Can a heart-rate sensor that small deliver accurate results? I was able to spend 30 minutes testing the Alta HR in a SoulCycle-esque spin class led by Fitbit Ambassador Julianne Hough. Amid thudding club beats and black lights, we were encouraged to periodically check our heart rate on the Alta HR. I admit I’m not the most coordinated person (and I’m nowhere near as glamorous as Ms. Hough while working out), but this was more of a challenge than I expected.</p>\n<p>Trying to tap the screen with one hand while simultaneously attempting not to fall off the stationary bike was a scene straight out of <i>Broad City.</i> When I finally did get it, I felt it was a feat worthy of its own Fitbit badge, given the fact that you have to tap multiple times to get to your heart rate. Thankfully, you can customize the main display via the Fitbit app so that all you have to do is raise your wrist to see your heart rate. This works fine while you’re at rest, but during a workout, you might have to do it multiple times.</p>\n<p class=\"pullQuote\"><b>You can customize the main display via the Fitbit app so that all you have to do is raise your wrist to see your heart rate.</b></p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0041-0120/146621-1-eng-US/f0041-012.jpg\" width=\"1307\" height=\"612\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0041-01\" title=\"f0041-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>FAST TRACKING</b></p>\n<p><b>A Fitbit represen-tative told me the Alta HR should be flush against your skin and worn one finger-length below your wrist bone for accurate heart-rate tracking.</b></p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>On the plus side, it’s still easier than viewing your heart rate on the Apple Watch. I wore an Apple Watch Nike+ at the same time, and having to navigate the digital crown to find and open the heart-rate app was a nightmare. It took every ounce of coordination in my body, but I did manage to check the Alta HR’s accuracy against the Apple Watch’s (and stay on my bike).</p>\n<p>The Alta HR proved accurate in heart-rate testing compared with the Apple Watch, Charge 2, LG Watch Sport, and a Polar H10 chest strap. In both walking and running tests, the Alta HR remained within 10bpm of the H10, which measures heart rate through electrical signal as opposed to optical. It performed even better when compared with other wrist-worn trackers, matching the Apple Watch, LG Watch Sport, and Charge 2 to within 5bpm.</p>\n<p>I did find there were some instances when the tracker wasn’t able to get a reading immediately—usually because of where I had it positioned on my arm. At the spin class, a Fitbit representative cautioned that the Alta HR should be flush against your skin and worn one finger-length below your wrist bone.</p>\n<p>When it comes to step counting, the Alta HR is accurate, and more important, consistent. I tested it over eight one-mile walks and runs, and each time found that it was usually within 2 to 3 percent of the Yamax SW-200 Digi-Walker, a pedometer frequently used in clinical studies. On my most recent walking test, it logged 2,078 steps to the Yamax’s 2,139, for a difference of 2.85 percent. It did slightly better on a one-mile run at 5mph, registering 1,892 steps to the Yamax’s 1,936 (a difference of 2.27 percent).</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0042-0114/146614-1-eng-US/f0042-012.jpg\" width=\"1441\" height=\"680\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0042-01\" title=\"f0042-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>TAPPED OUT</b></p>\n<p><b>You have to tap directly in the center of the touch screen with a bit more force than you might expect. Light taps and anything on the edges are unlikely to register.</b></p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>That’s not the best result I’ve seen—the Alta HR has a tendency to underreport steps, which means you’ll need to walk more to hit your goals. (A blessing in disguise, perhaps?) But its average results are more telling. Over four one-mile walks at 3.5mph, the Alta averaged about 2,123 steps compared with the Yamax’s 2,135. And over four runs, it averaged 1,897 steps to the Yamax’s 1,950. With the exception of one walking test, the Alta HR generally reported results that were within 10 to 50 steps for the same repeated exercises. Long story short: There are more accurate trackers out there, but the Alta HR delivers reliable results.</p>\n<p>Another plus is good battery life. Typically, most of Fitbit’s trackers are rated to last about five days between charges, depending on usage. With the Alta HR, Fitbit says you should get up to seven days. In the past, I’ve found my Fitbits last about three days between charges. So I was pleased as punch to find the Alta HR exceeded expectations. I’ve had to charge it only three times over three weeks, so it’s safe to say it lives up to the seven-day estimate, and that’s with continuous heart rate monitoring and multiple syncs per day.</p>\n<h3><b>SLEEP SMARTER</b></h3><p>Heart rate isn’t the only thing the Alta HR’s PurePulse sensor is good for. Fitbit is also introducing two new tools that utilize heart rate data: Sleep Stages and Sleep Insights.</p>\n<p>Until now, Fitbit users could see sleep quality measured only in terms of how many minutes they’re awake, restless, or asleep. The Sleep Stages tool is designed to use the accelerometer, heart-rate variability (time between beats), and Fitbit’s algorithms to more accurately report when you’re awake or in light, deep, or REM sleep. This feature isn’t limited to the Alta HR—it’ll also be available on the Fitbit Blaze and Charge 2.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0043-0117/146607-1-eng-US/f0043-012.jpg\" width=\"1300\" height=\"425\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0043-01\" title=\"f0043-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p class=\"pullQuote\"><b>Sleep stages display in an artful wave of blue and pink, a more helpful visual representation than color blocks.</b></p>\n<p>The feature had been enabled for only a few days when I started testing, but I’m already a fan. As someone who struggles with insomnia and sleepwalking, I found the data breakdown very useful. Sleep stages are displayed in an artful wave of blue and pink, a good visual representation that’s more helpful than the previous linear blocks of color the app used to show. Think back to your high school math classes: A “normal” sleep cycle should resemble a cosine wave. So if your waves are too pinched, or you notice that you fall into REM before light sleep, you might need to adjust your sleep routine.</p>\n<p>Also helpful are the little bar graphs that show your 30-day average and how you compare with other Fitbit users of the same age and gender. Straight data can read like a jumble of numbers, so this is a clever visual aid to quickly let you know what kind of “better” sleep you should be aiming for.</p>\n<p>The Sleep Insights feature is pretty much what it sounds like: context for the 2.5 million years of sleep data Fitbit has collected from its users thus far. So, for example, if you sleep significantly longer on weekend nights, the app will suggest you’re not getting enough sleep on weeknights. The Sleep Stages feature is limited to the aforementioned devices, but Sleep Insights will be accessible on any Fitbit that tracks sleep.</p>\n<h3><b>CONCLUSION</b></h3><p>Both the Alta HR and the Charge 2 go for $150, which makes deciding between the two a tough decision. Neither is perfect for swimmers, triathletes, or anyone looking for more of a smartwatch experience. But for all-day, everyday use, the Alta HR and Charge 2 offer similar functionality in different form factors.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0045-0124/146600-1-eng-US/f0045-012.jpg\" width=\"1353\" height=\"692\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0045-01\" title=\"f0045-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>NEED AN ALTIMETER?</b></p>\n<p><b>The Charge 2 has an altimeter, and the Alta HR does not. That said, Fitbit’s altimeters count only the stairs you climb, not ones you descend, and any work you do on a stair machine is moot since you’re not changing elevation.</b></p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>The Alta HR wins in terms of comfort. Slim and lightweight, I barely ever felt like I was wearing it during testing.</p>\n<p>But the Charge 2 shines in providing context about your cardio fitness levels. Since it has connected GPS, it calculates VO2 max to give you a better sense of where you stand compared with other people your age, weight, and gender—info you don’t get with the Alta HR. That makes it a better choice for anyone really looking to take charge of their health and fitness levels.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, the one to pick comes down to one question: Would you rather spend your money on a better design and longer battery life or on more functionality and features? Though the Alta HR can keep pace with the Charge 2 on most levels, it makes slight concessions in order to maintain its attractive design. If you’re serious about kickstarting a new fitness routine, you’re still better off with the Charge 2—but only slightly.</p>\n<p class=\"byline\"><b>VICTORIA SONG</b></p>\n","layout":{},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":0,"link_source":"","competition":[],"flatplan_title":"","notes":"","gutter_credit":"","other":"","image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1493839901.398","name":"f0039-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0039-0113/146642-1-eng-US/f0039-012.jpg?t=default_ipad_portrait&ext/f0039-012_default_ipad_portrait.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"694","height":"1024","legacy_id":"12235","is_default":true},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1493839901.398","name":"f0039-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0039-0113/146642-1-eng-US/f0039-012.jpg?t=default_ipad_landscape&ext/f0039-012_default_ipad_landscape.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"521","height":"768","legacy_id":"12235","is_default":false}],"related_objects":{"image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_6_1493839894.0135","name":"f0045-01","source":"","caption":"<p><b>NEED AN ALTIMETER?</b></p>\n<p><b>The Charge 2 has an altimeter, and the Alta HR does not.

Its classic design and optical viewfinder appeals to modern photographers who, in the past, would have opted for a compact rangefinder. The latest version, the X100F compact camera, keeps the basic design of previous models with a few minor tweaks, ups the sensor resolution to 24MP, and offers an improved autofocus system. If you yearn for a camera that’s almost pocket friendly, offers the image quality of an SLR, and is simply a joy to use, look no further: The X100F is our Editors’ Choice.</p>\n<h3><b>DESIGN AND CONTROLS</b></h3><p>The template for the X100 design hasn’t changed much in the lifespan of the series—it’s now about six years old and in its fourth generation. This version measures in at 2.9 by 5.0 by 2.1 inches (HWD) and weighs just about a pound. It’s available in a silver finish with black leatherette or in an all-black edition. We received the silver body for review.</p>\n<p>The X100F boasts a fixed 23mm f/2 lens and APS-C image sensor, giving it a field of view similar to a 35mm lens in a full-frame system. If you prefer a wider (28mm) field of view, you can add the WCL-X100 II conversion lens ($349), and fans of 50mm can tighten the scope of the lens with the TCL-X100 II ($349). But both add bulk to the camera and take away the ability to slide it into a pocket.</p>\n<p>Another excellent pocket-friendly 28mm equivalent on the market is the Ricoh GR II. It’s getting up there in age but remains a solid option for 28mm fans. And full-frame compacts are available with similar lens designs, but both the 28mm Leica Q and 35mm Sony RX1R II are priced above $3,000, putting them in a much more premium price category.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0047-0123/146713-1-eng-US/f0047-012.jpg\" width=\"917\" height=\"595\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0047-01\" title=\"f0047-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>A GOOD-LOOKING SHOOTER</b></p>\n<p><b>The slim X100F features an APS-C image sensor, which has been updated to 24MP, compared with 16MP in previous iterations.</b></p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p><b>Fujifilm X100F</b></p>\n<p><b>PROS Crisp wide-angle lens.

Wi-Fi.</b></p>\n<p><b>CONS Lens lacks stabilization. Video limited to 1080p. Sometimes struggles with tracking subjects.</b></p>\n<p>For a camera of this size, you’re more likely to turn to the built-in flash than an external one, although a hot shoe is there so you can mount an external flash or radio trigger. It’s a convenient way to fill in shadows when shooting outdoors, or to brighten a scene where’s there’s simply not enough light, even for an f/2 lens and extreme ISO capabilities. By default, there’s no easy button to get to the flash settings and turn it on or off—or adjust its power.</p>\n<p>But the X100F is a very customizable camera. Most of its buttons can be remapped, so if you don’t see yourself requiring quick access to a particular button, you can remap it. The breadth of settings that can be assigned are too lengthy to list here. The X100F online manual runs through the entirety of the customizations. One of the physical changes from the previous-generation X100T is right on the front plate—the X100F has a front control dial, a first for the series. Its functionality is rather limited, though. It can be used to adjust EV compensation or ISO, but only if you set the EV dial to its C position or set the A position of the ISO dial to a Custom setting rather than the default Automatic in the menu system.</p>\n<p class=\"pullQuote\"><b>The X100F is a very customizable camera.

Using the front dial to control ISO makes adjustment a bit easier than the top ISO dial, which is integrated into the shutter control and requires you to pull up on the dial and twist it to adjust the setting. If you frequently change the ISO, you may find the front dial to be more comfortable to use. If you want to control both settings via the dial, a push inward will switch its functionality.</p>\n<p>Also on the front is a toggle switch, styled after the film rewind switch on a classic Leica rangefinder. It’s is used to change between the electronic and optical viewfinder mode. It has a button at its center; pressing it displays an on-screen menu that adjusts the setting of the control ring surrounding the lens. You can leave it set to its default function, which activates a Digital Teleconverter when shooting JPG only, but does nothing when Raw capture is enabled. It crops images to a 50mm or 70mm field of view, upscaling the photo to maintain a 24MP resolution at both focal lengths.</p>\n<p>You also have the option of setting the dial to adjust White Balance or switch Film Simulation modes on the fly. The control ring only works to adjust these settings when the X100F is set to AF-S or AF-C; if you use manual focus, the ring is dedicated to focus adjustment.</p>\n<p>Also surrounding the lens is a physical aperture control ring. It can be set to f/2 through f/16 in third-stop increments, and has an A setting for automatic aperture control as well. The focus mode switch is on the left side, toward the bottom; it has S, C, and M settings for single or continuous autofocus, or manual focus.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0049-0124/146699-1-eng-US/f0049-012.jpg\" width=\"1308\" height=\"638\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0049-01\" title=\"f0049-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div>\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0050-0125/146692-1-eng-US/f0050-012.jpg\" width=\"917\" height=\"442\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0050-01\" title=\"f0050-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p class=\"pullQuote\"><b>Rear mode switches between viewfinder and the rear LCD. It has a setting for the eye sensor to change automatically.</b></p>\n<p>On top, to the left of the hot shoe, you’ll find a pair of dials, the power switch, shutter release, and the Fn button. The shutter dial has Bulb, Timed, and standard settings from 1 second to 1/4,000-second. ISO control is nested, with the current setting visible in a cutout window. To change the ISO, pull up on its knurled edges and twist. It takes a little getting used to, but as mentioned before, you can switch ISO control to the front dial if you find the operation tricky.</p>\n<p>The EV dial can be set for -3 to +3EV adjustment in third-stop increments. There’s also a C setting, which moves control to the front dial, for a five-stop adjustment range. The shutter release is a typical dual-action design—a half-press engages autofocus and a full press captures an image. Its design includes a standard thread for a mechanical release, a feature not seen on many modern cameras. The Fn button sets the metering pattern by default, but can be reprogrammed—I set it to toggle the in-lens neutral density filter.</p>\n<p>Rear controls include View Mode, which is above the LCD, just to the right of the eyecup. It switches between viewfinder and the rear LCD, and has a setting for the eye sensor to change automatically. To its right are an AEL/AFL button and the rear control dial. The dial shifts shutter speed when shooting in Program mode—which is set when shutter speed and aperture are both set to A. Pushing it in zooms the Live View feed so you can confirm proper focus.</p>\n<p>Other rear controls include a dedicated focus joystick, just to the right of the rear LCD. It moves the active focus point when the camera isn’t set to its Wide focus setting. Below it are Play, Delete, and Disp/Back buttons. A four-way control pad, with center Menu/OK button, is further to the right of the LCD. Its top position is dedicated to change the Drive mode, but the right, bottom, and left directions are customizable. By default they adjust the White Balance, AF mode, and Film Simulation settings.</p>\n<p>The Q button is also on the rear, toward the upper right corner. It launches an on-screen menu that provides quick access to a number of options, including display brightness, flash settings, image quality and tone, and the self-timer. Like the physical buttons, all 16 available settings can be customized to suit your needs. The display isn’t a touch screen, but the menu is quickly navigated using the rear joystick to move from setting to setting and the rear control dial to adjust the highlighted function.</p>\n<p>The X100F squeezes enough physical controls into its small frame to satisfy demanding photographers, and almost all are customizable. If you don’t like the way it handles out of the box, you’ll be able to change the button functions to suit your style. If you’re a more visual person, the Q menu is just as flexible.</p>\n<h3><b>VIEWFINDER AND LCD</b></h3><p>A hybrid viewfinder is the hallmark of the X100 series. The X100F doesn’t make any real changes here compared with the last couple models. The optical portion is bright, with an electronic overlay that shows current exposure settings and a frame that indicates the boundaries of the image. It’s wider than the lens, so you’ll be able to see a bit of action happening outside the frame. Additionally, the frame line moves after focus is locked, correcting for the parallax effect you get when focusing close up.</p>\n<p>The focus points are also visible. They cover most of the frame, although only the central area, framed by an olive overlay, is covered by phase detection. The focus point or points that the X100F is using to lock focus are highlighted in green when the shutter is half pressed.</p>\n<p>A flick of the front toggle changes the viewfinder to EVF mode. The quality is the same as you get from models dating back to the X100S. It’s a 2,359k-dot LCD that is quite sharp to the eye. Using the EVF previews your final image, including any Film Simulation you have set. If you prefer a more natural view, better simulating the look of an optical finder when using the EVF, you can disable the Preview Picture Effect setting in the menu. The rear display is a fixed LCD panel without support for touch input. It’s 3 inches in size and very sharp at 1,040k dots. Viewing angles are strong, and at full brightness it’s easy to see the image in bright sunlight.</p>\n<p>When using the EVF or LCD, you have a few options when it comes to aiding manual focus. By default, the focus aid is simple frame magnification. But you also have peaking, which highlights in-focus areas of the frame, and a digital split image available. The digital split breaks the image into several rows, which are offset when your shot is out of focus, but line up perfectly when you’ve nailed manual focus.</p>\n<h3><b>FILM SIMULATION AND CONNECTIVITY</b></h3><p>One of the bright points of recent Fujifilm cameras is the bevy of Film Simulation settings available. You can shoot images with a Standard look, which the company likens to its Provia slide film. Other slide film options include Astia for a soft look, Classic Chrome for the muted colors of Kodachroma, and the punchy, vivid tones of Velvia. Color negative film is simulated in Pro mode in standard and high contrast. In addition to a standard black-and-white option, the X100F include Fuji’s signature Acros stock, with your choice of simulated color filter, and a Sepia mode.</p>\n<p class=\"pullQuote\"><b>The X100F squeezes enough physical controls into its small frame to satisfy demanding photographers.</b></p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0052-0124/146685-1-eng-US/f0052-012.jpg\" width=\"918\" height=\"485\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0052-01\" title=\"f0052-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>EASY ON THE EYES</b></p>\n<p><b>The crisp rear LCD features adjustable brightness, so it can be easily viewed in bright light.</b></p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>You can add grain to any of the film looks—you have the option of a standard or strong effect, or no added grain at all. The Film Simulations are only applied to JPG images, but if you like the look you can always shoot in Raw+JPG mode and have the choice of using the out-of-camera version or adjusting a Raw image to taste. You can also apply any number of looks to Raw images in the camera itself; you can use its Raw processing function to create as many different JPGs from a single Raw shot as you’d like.</p>\n<p>Wi-Fi is also baked into the camera. The free Fuji Camera Remote app, available for Android and iOS, lets you transfer images directly to your smartphone for quick social sharing. The app also works as a remote control, complete with a Live View feed to your phone, exposure adjustment controls, and the ability to tap on your phone’s screen to set focus.</p>\n<p>The X100F has a few ports, including a 2.5mm microphone input, micro HDMI, and micro USB. The USB port supports in-camera charging, but Fujifilm also includes an external charger with the camera. The battery is different than the one used by the X100T: It packs more juice, powering the camera for 390 shots per charge per CIPA’s standard testing procedure. It’s the same type of battery used by the X-T2, X-Pro2, and X-T20, a plus if you own multiple Fujifilm cameras.</p>\n<h3><b>PERFORMANCE AND AUTOFOCUS</b></h3><p>The X100F is really speedy. It starts, focuses, and fires in just 0.9 second, locks focus in as little as 0.1 second, and fires off shots at a quick 8fps burst rate. It can keep that pace for 22 Raw+JPG or Raw captures, or 47 JPGs. When using a SanDisk 280MBps memory card the buffer requires about 38 seconds to clear after a full Raw+JPG burst, 28 seconds for Raw, and 18 seconds for JPG. The new autofocus system covers almost the entire width of the sensor with contrast detection points, although coverage is lacking at the top and bottom of the frame, giving the active focus area the look of a wide-screen movie on an old standard definition TV. The joystick makes for quick moves of the active point. By default, the camera displays 91 points, but if you want to see all the available points you can set it to show the entire 325-point system and size down the focus area for precise control. I found that using the 91-point display and a larger focus box got the job done better, as it’s quicker to move the point from one area of the frame to another. But for shots where a very precise focus is required, you have that option.</p>\n<p>The X100F has an expanded focus area mode as well. Using it limits your selection to the 91-point display area and covers 9 of those points at all times. It’s very useful for situations where the point of focus may change quickly from shot to shot, as you can move the focus area from one side of the frame to the other with a few flicks of the joystick. Finally, there’s a wide focus area that lets the X100F decide what to focus on.</p>\n<p>In practical terms, there’s very little to complain about when it comes to the X100F’s focus system. It’s speedy, customizable, and gives you the option of precise or coarse control over the focus point. If there’s one area where it suffers it’s in tracking fast-moving subjects. Our standard focus test fires off shots continuously while moving back and forth from our test target at varying speeds. The X100F slows its burst rate to get more shots in focus, but still came up with a middling hit rate. It’s not a huge deal for this type of camera—you’re probably not going to shoot a basketball game with a wide-angle lens. The focus system is more than capable of capturing the close-up, candid moments of everyday life.</p>\n<h3><b>IMAGE AND VIDEO QUALITY</b></h3><p>The X100F enjoys a serious image quality upgrade over previous models. It uses the same 24MP X-Trans image sensor that has delivered excellent results we’ve seen in the X-Pro2 and X-T2. Despite packing more pixels, noise is better controlled than the 16MP sensors used in earlier versions of the camera, and image quality holds up better at higher ISO settings.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0054-0125/146678-1-eng-US/f0054-012.jpg\" width=\"1000\" height=\"397\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0054-01\" title=\"f0054-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>While the X100T keeps noise under control only through ISO 6400, the X100F manages to curb it to under 1.5 percent through ISO 12800, a one-stop advantage. When shooting JPGs with default noise reduction settings enabled (you can set the noise reduction to be more or less aggressive), image quality is excellent through ISO 3200. There’s some slight smudging of detail visible at ISO 6400, which gives way to a more noticeably blurred look at ISO 12800. ISO 25600 and 51200 are also available, but blur kills image detail at both settings.</p>\n<p class=\"pullQuote\"><b>The FujiFilm X100F enjoys a serious image quality upgrade over previous models in the series.</b></p>\n<p>Noise reduction isn’t applied to Raw images in camera. We use Lightroom CC as our standard conversion software, which does apply some modest color noise reduction by default. Raw photos show very strong detail through ISO 3200. Grain starts to detract from fine detail at ISO 6400, but results are still very useable. Grain is rougher at ISO 12800, but I’d still feel comfortable using it when a shot calls for it. Results are rougher still at ISO 25600, but not in any way blurry. ISO 51200 is available as an option, but noise wipes away almost all detail—you should avoid pushing the camera that far if possible.</p>\n<p>The lens is the same 23mm f/2 we’ve seen in earlier X100 models. It delivers similar results with the new sensor at f/2—2,166 lines per picture height on Imatest’s standard center-weighted sharpness test. Edges are soft, 1,585 lines, but the rest of the frame betters the 1,800-line mark we want to see at a minimum. Edges don’t improve at f/2.8, but the center and mid parts of the frame do, upping the average score to 2,349 lines.</p>\n<p>The low edge score is exacerbated by some field curvature, which affects edges at the close distance at which we frame our test chart. If you’re focusing at a further distance you’ll net crisper results, and if you’re shooting a subject close up, a shallow depth of field should mask any peripheral softness.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0056-0121/146671-1-eng-US/f0056-012.jpg\" width=\"999\" height=\"491\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0056-01\" title=\"f0056-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>Depth of field reduces the effect of curvature and sharpness improves in general at f/4. The average score is an excellent 2,854 lines here, with edges that top 2,000 lines. Image quality is about the same at f/5.6 (2,849 lines), f/8 (2,998 lines), and f/11 (2,840 lines). The best edge performance is enjoyed at f/8 and f/11, with the lens showing better than 2,400 lines at the periphery at both f-stops. You can shoot at f/16, but we don’t recommend it—diffraction cuts the overall resolution to 2,246 lines.</p>\n<p>Lens sharpness does suffer when focusing close at f/2, delivering images with a somewhat soft-focus look—you’ll want to stop down to f/2.8 or f/4 for crisper macro shots. The X100F focuses to 3.9 inches (10cm), which makes the X100F a versatile tool for close-up work.</p>\n<p>The in-lens leaf shutter is nearly silent and can fire as quickly as 1/4,000-second, with flash sync available at all speeds. But even with a fast shutter, the base ISO 200 sensitivity can make it difficult to shoot at f/2 under bright light without overexposing an image. To combat this there’s an in-lens neutral density filter. It cuts out three stops of light, making the effective base ISO 25 when enabled.</p>\n<p>The X100F records video at up to 1080p quality at 60fps. Even though it uses the same sensor as the X-T2, 4K capture isn’t supported. Heat is likely an issue preventing 4K implementation. The X100F’s 1080p footage is quite crisp, and the autofocus system does a good job locking onto focus and adjusting as the scene changes. There’s a mic input, which is a plus for using the X100F for more serious video projects, but the lens lacks image stabilization. This gives handheld footage a jittery look, so you’ll want to utilize a tripod if possible.</p>\n<h3><b>CONCLUSIONS</b></h3><p>The Fujifilm X100F is the best entry in the series yet, thanks to refined controls and a big upgrade in image quality with a 24MP image sensor that delivers better autofocus and high ISO performance. The unique hybrid optical/electronic viewfinder set it apart from others in its class, including premium full-frame models that only sport EVFs.</p>\n<p class=\"pullQuote\"><b>Photographers who want a compact alternative to schlepping an SLR around should look at the X100F closely.</b></p>\n<p>Combine the image quality and speedy focus system with a highly customizable control layout with plenty of physical and on-screen control options, and you have a camera that’s easy to recommend. Photographers who want a compact alternative to schlepping an SLR around should look at the X100F closely, and it’s a natural fit for fans of analog rangefinders, as the shooting experience isn’t far off from using one, just with autofocus.</p>\n<p>The Ricoh GR II, another winner, is still available, and remains a solid choice if you don’t mind losing the viewfinder and prefer a wider field of view, but its 16MP image sensor is beginning to show its age. There are are also premium full-frame models to consider. The 42MP Sony RX1R II gives you more cropping capability and includes an EVF and a similar 35mm f/2 lens, and the Leica Q matches the X100F in sensor resolution but sports a wider, brighter 28mm f/1.7 lens. But you’ll need to spend a few thousand dollars. That makes the X100F an easy pick as Editors’ Choice. It stands apart from others in its class, delivering just about as much image quality as you can want in a camera of this size.</p>\n<p class=\"byline\"><b>JIM

drone, the Karma ($799.99 on its own, $1,099.99 with a Hero5 Black action camera). When it was unveiled last year, no other drone on the market had such a svelte form factor. But the wind was quickly taken out of the Karma’s sails by the comparatively tiny and more capable DJI Mavic Pro, and its rollout was marred by a recall due to a faulty battery latch design. After months of delays, the Karma is finally finished and on sale. But time has not been kind, and there are better drones out there.</p>\n<h3><b>DESIGN</b></h3><p>The Karma features a folding design, with arms and landing gear that tuck into the body for storage and transport, and a nose-mounted gimbal. It measures 4.6 by 16.2 by 12.0 inches (HWD) when ready to fly and 3.5 by 8.8 by 14.4 inches when folded for transport. It weighs 2.2 pounds, so you will have to register with the FAA before flying. It’s smaller than a DJI Phantom drone, but not anywhere near as svelte as DJI’s compact Mavic Pro. The tiny foldable Mavic measures 3.3 by 3.3 by 7.8 inches when folded and weighs about 1.6 pounds.</p>\n<p>The Karma’s propellers must be screwed on before each flight and removed to fit in its case. This takes only a minute or so, so it’s not a big deal, but it’s not as convenient as the Mavic Pro, which has always-on, folding propellers, or the DJI Phantom 4, which boasts more modern twist-and-lock props.</p>\n<p>A backpack is included to transport the drone. It holds the Karma and all of its accessories with ease, and can be strapped to your back or carried like a briefcase. This includes the grip for handheld gimbal use, the remote control, the six included propellers, and the battery charger. GoPro claims the pack is comfortable to wear while biking or other outdoor activities, but it’s a little bulky for that, and it doesn’t hang as comfortably on my body as the ThinkTank Urban Approach backpack I like to wear when hiking with photo gear.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0059-0125/146777-1-eng-US/f0059-012.jpg\" width=\"917\" height=\"537\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0059-01\" title=\"f0059-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>CASE IN POINT The included case holds the Karma and all of its accessories, but I didn’t find it to be very comfortable to wear.</b></p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p><b>GoPro Karma</b></p>\n<p><b>PROS Works with Hero4 and Hero5 cameras. Includes handheld grip for gimbal. Solid tutorial for beginning pilots. Remote has integrated display. Some automated flight features. Easy offline map downloads. Includes backpack.</b></p>\n<p><b>CONS Short 15-minute flight time. Very limited suburban operating range. GoPro camera not ideal for aerial work. Remote screen is prone to glare. Omits obstacle avoidance and follow mode.</b></p>\n<p>The stabilizing gimbal is mounted at the nose. It’s removable, so you can opt to use it handheld with the included Karma Grip. The Grip, which costs $299.99 when bought separately, is a handheld pistol-style grip for your GoPro. It has its own internal battery and keeps your camera straight and level, even when walking. Think of it like a handheld Steadicam.</p>\n<p class=\"pullQuote\"><b>The Karma features a folding design, with arms and landing gear that tuck into the body for storage and transport.</b></p>\n<p>The remote control features a clamshell design. When opened, it shows a glossy 5-inch LCD with 720p resolution and a 900cd/m2 brightness rating. On paper, that’s pretty bright, but the high-gloss finish is very prone to glare. In practice, I had a much easier time viewing an iPhone 6 Plus display at full brightness when compared with the Karma remote at its maximum setting under identical conditions. GoPro would have been better off using a matte finish to improve screen visibility.</p>\n<p>The face of the remote features two control sticks, and Power, Return-to-Home, and Start/Stop buttons. There’s also a speaker, as the remote gives audio cues in addition to visual information on its screen. The top left side hosts a wheel that tilts the gimbal up and down, and the right includes Mode and Record buttons. I found it very comfortable to hold.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, the LED that backs the power button is almost too bright. It’s not a big deal when you’re flying, but if you’re sitting at home setting up the remote, it’s likely to bother your eyes.</p>\n<h3><b>FLIGHT EXPERIENCE</b></h3><p>There are a few things you’ll need to do before flying the Karma for the first time. The first is create a free GoPro account. You can do this using the remote control, simply by connecting it to your home network and walking through a few steps.</p>\n<p>Once that’s done, the remote prompts you to fly some practice routes in a virtual environment. The flight simulator guides you through the Karma’s basic operation and is a big plus for first-time drone pilots. The tutorial lets you know how the controls work—the left stick adjusts altitude and yaws the Karma left and right, while the right moves it forward, left, right, and back in space.</p>\n<p>Here’s something else you’ll want to do from your armchair—download some maps. The Karma remote doesn’t have its own LTE connection, so it can’t access Google Maps data. When you know you’re going to fly in a specific area, you can download a map complete with road names and satellite imagery. You can search for maps by name or ZIP code, and each map requires about two minutes to download.</p>\n<h3><b>PERFORMANCE</b></h3><p>The Karma is a perfectly capable aircraft. It locks onto a GPS signal quickly and is very stable in the air. The drone’s top speed is limited—GoPro rates it at 35mph, but I found that cruising speed was closer to 20mph in my test flights. There’s an adjustable geofence to prevent the Karma from straying too far from its launch point.</p>\n<p>Operating range is an issue, though. In a standard suburban setting, the video feed started to degrade at just a 700-foot distance. At 900 feet, the control signal was lost, and the drone entered its return-to-home mode. It turns around, putting its nose toward the launch point, and makes a beeline to home base. If something terrible happens and the signal isn’t reacquired, it will land, but chances are the drone and remote will start talking to each other well before that happens.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0061-0123/146770-1-eng-US/f0061-012.jpg\" width=\"1442\" height=\"625\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0061-01\" title=\"f0061-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>DRONE ON</b></p>\n<p><b>The Karma features a four-rotor design and includes some automated features, but doesn’t have a Follow Me mode.</b></p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>In a rural setting free from home Wi-Fi networks clogging the airwaves, operating range is much better. I had no issues taking the Karma out to 3,000 feet, just within the limits of its default geofence.</p>\n<p>Battery life is poor compared with competing models. The Karma gives you a 17-minute estimate of battery life when you take off, but that’s with minimal maneuvering and altitude changes. In real life, I netted about 15 minutes of flying time on average—eight minutes less than the DJI Mavic Pro. Even if you try to stretch that, the drone automatically returns to home when its battery gets low, and it lands in place when it gets down to about a minute of life. An additional battery is $99.99.</p>\n<p>The Karma has a few automated flight modes. To access them, you need to turn off the default Easy operation mode, which you should do only when you’re comfortable behind the controls. You can set up perfectly circular, automated orbits, move from point to point in Cable Cam mode, or start with the camera honed in on your person and pull up and away to reveal the landscape around you in what GoPro calls a Dronie.</p>\n<p>The automated flight mode that’s conspicuously absent is Follow. It’s a mode you’d think the GoPro crowd would demand—the ability for your drone to track your movements while it’s performing some insane stunt. The lack of obstacle detection and avoidance probably went into the decision-making process to omit this popular feature from the Karma. The DJI Mavic Pro, on the other hand, can actually identify and track a subject automatically, and has an obstacle avoidance system to help prevent it from crashing when tracking.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0062-0125/146763-1-eng-US/f0062-012.jpg\" width=\"1442\" height=\"679\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0062-01\" title=\"f0062-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>REMOTE</b></p>\n<p><b>The Karma’s remote has the basic controls you need to fly a drone, including a Home button and dual control sticks.</b></p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>VIDEO QUALITY</b></h3><p>We reviewed the Karma with GoPro’s latest flagship camera, the Hero5 Black. It shoots in 4K at frame rates up to 30fps and with an ultra-wide field of view only. If you opt for less resolution, you have options for a tighter field of view and faster frame rates.</p>\n<p class=\"pullQuote\"><b>I had no issues taking the Karma out to 3,000 feet, just within the limits of its default geofence.</b></p>\n<p>I don’t see a GoPro action camera as an ideal tool for aerials. Its size is right, but the ultra-wide lens with a modest fish-eye effect is simply too wide for a lot of aerial applications. This is why most drones with integrated cameras have moved to narrower lenses—the DJI Phantom 4 series uses a 20mm-equivalent prime, and the Mavic Pro is a little bit narrower at 25mm. When you’re performing tricks or flips on a big bike ramp, having a tighter lens, which puts more distance between you and the aircraft, can be a blessing, and the 25mm scope is a fine choice for aerial landscape photography and videography.</p>\n<p>That said, if you prefer ultra-wide, the GoPro delivers solid results. Its ProTune mode delivers crisp video with your option of a Flat or GoPro color profile—the former is a plus for those who want to color-grade their footage. What you don’t get is the ability to adjust exposure on the fly. Most drones let you brighten or darken a video using EV compensation when working in automatic exposure and set a manual exposure using a specified shutter speed and ISO. That’s not the case with the Karma—the exposure the camera thinks is right is the one you get. That’s a major downside for its use as a tool for aerial videography.</p>\n<p>The Hero5 Black does shoot images in Raw, and its GPR file format is supported by the current version of Lightroom CC and Adobe Camera Raw.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0064-0123/146756-1-eng-US/f0064-012.jpg\" width=\"1217\" height=\"692\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0064-01\" title=\"f0064-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>VERY GRIPPING</b></p>\n<p><b>The included Karma Grip lets you use your GoPro in a handheld manner, with as much stabilization as you get in the air.

And while brand devotees who already own a compatible GoPro action cam may see some upsides—including the bundled Karma Grip and relatively attractive price point—I don’t think it should be your first choice. The lack of obstacle avoidance and the ultra-wide GoPro field of view are downsides, as is the omission of an automated follow mode.</p>\n<p>The Karma also isn’t as portable as GoPro would like you to think. Though it folds and has a shorter minimum height than an entry-level DJI Phantom 3 Standard, it still must be carried in its own case. The Mavic Pro is still the only truly small drone on the market that doesn’t leave any features on the table. Its remote control is the size of a video game controller, and it folds to about the size of a water bottle—small enough to simply toss in your messenger bag.</p>\n<p>Our Editors’ Choice in this price range is the DJI Phantom 4. It’s larger than the Karma but can be carried in a small case or backpack. It sells for less than the Karma and features obstacle avoidance, subject tracking, and 4K capture.</p>\n<p class=\"byline\"><b>JIM FISHER</b></p>\n","layout":{},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":0,"link_source":"","competition":[],"flatplan_title":"","notes":"","gutter_credit":"","other":"","image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1493839919.1939","name":"f0058-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0058-0126/146791-1-eng-US/f0058-012.jpg?t=default_ipad_portrait&ext/f0058-012_default_ipad_portrait.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"768","height":"358","legacy_id":"12254","is_default":true},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1493839919.1939","name":"f0058-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0058-0126/146791-1-eng-US/f0058-012.jpg?t=default_ipad_landscape&ext/f0058-012_default_ipad_landscape.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"1024","height":"477","legacy_id":"12254","is_default":false}],"related_objects":{"image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_5_1493839913.9473","name":"f0064-01","source":"","caption":"<p><b>VERY GRIPPING</b></p>\n<p><b>The included Karma Grip lets you use your GoPro in a handheld manner, with as much stabilization as you get in the air.

computers and peripherals. Microsoft set out to change that—and to bring more creatives to the Windows platform—with the Surface Studio (starting at $2,999; $4,199 as tested), a touch-screen all-in-one (AIO) PC that can stand upright like a traditional desktop display or recline to serve as a digital canvas, letting designers draw, sketch, and edit as they would on a dedicated drawing tablet or physical medium. It’s all wrapped up in a thin, thoughtfully designed package, making it equal parts attractive, innovative, and useful. It’s expensive and lacks cutting-edge components, but the Surface Studio still manages to easily earn our Editors’ Choice endorsement for high-end AIO PCs.</p>\n<h3><b>DIGITAL DRAFTING BOARD</b></h3><p>First, a quick rundown for the uninitiated: The Surface Studio all-in-one PC is the first desktop in Microsoft’s hit Surface line, which has set the benchmark for convertible laptops. In keeping with that spirit but tying it squarely to your desk, the Studio’s super-thin 28-inch touch screen can tilt from an upright setup (what Microsoft calls Desktop Mode) to a reclined, canvas-like state (Studio Mode). The screen is just 0.44-inch thick, while the components and ports are all housed in a base that measures 1.26 by 8.66 by 9.84 inches (HWD).</p>\n<p>The Studio’s design and build are gorgeous. The look is undeniably iMac-inspired, but the convertibility and glinting metal legs attaching the screen to the base give the Studio a distinctive look. The “gravity hinge” can stop at any point between fully upright and reclined. It slides effortlessly between modes, and you can push the screen down or up with a single finger.</p>\n<p>The display bears a PixelSense resolution of 4,500 by 3,000, which includes 63 percent more pixels than a 4K television (192ppi). The Apple iMac With 5K Retina Display, by comparison, has a 27-inch screen with 5,210-by-2,880 resolution, though it’s tough to compare directly, because the Studio’s aspect ratio is also different than standard wide-screen. Its 3:2 ratio was chosen with designers in mind, as one inch on the screen represents one inch in reality, better mirroring physical work in a digital space.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0066-0126/146855-1-eng-US/f0066-012.jpg\" width=\"776\" height=\"247\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0066-01\" title=\"f0066-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>WE’RE CONVERTED</b></p>\n<p><b>The Surface Studio all-in-one desktop, is the first non-mobile device in Microsoft’s hit Surface line, which has set the benchmark for convertible laptops.</b></p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p><b>Microsoft Surface Studio</b></p>\n<p><b>PROS Stunning design. Elegant all-in-one digital creation solution. Fast performance. Super-thin display with fantastic image quality. Responsive, accurate touch screen for art and design work.</b></p>\n<p><b>CONS Doesn’t use the latest components. Lacks expandability options.</b></p>\n<p>The screen is incredibly crisp and vibrant, suiting the work many creative types will use it for. The colors are bold and bright—the display uses 10-bit color depth and supports the P3 and SRGB color gamuts, which you can swap between on the fly. It’s brilliantly bright on the default Vivid color profile (so much so that the maximum setting hurt my eyes up close at times, driving me to lower it down a notch). You won’t have to worry about images appearing too dim. Fingerprints do smudge up the screen, but you can really see them only when it’s powered off.</p>\n<p>Of course, exceptional screen quality alone is not what will have designers flocking to the Surface Studio: Its convertibility is what makes this high-end all-in-one desktop a real artist’s workstation. With the display folded down, draw directly on it becomes infinitely easier compared with a traditional upright monitor, and that’s what gives the Surface Studio its unique value.</p>\n<p>Microsoft is aggressively targeting the creative demographic, which has been Apple’s bread and butter with the iMac and MacBooks for years. This is obvious with additions in the Windows 10 Creators Update such as Paint 3D and upgrades to Windows Ink.</p>\n<p class=\"pullQuote\"><b>The converti-bility and glinting metal legs attaching the screen to the base give the Studio a distinctive look.</b></p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0067-0123/146848-1-eng-US/f0067-012.jpg\" width=\"925\" height=\"583\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0067-01\" title=\"f0067-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>QUITE RESOLVED</b></p>\n<p><b>The display has a PixelSense resolution of 4,500 by 3,000, which includes 63 percent more pixels than a 4K television.</b></p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>By embracing touch capability on the hardware and software fronts (while Apple continues to relegate touch to iOS only), the Surface Studio could feasibly become the go-to for designers and artists. More important, it continues the transformation of Windows and PCs as stodgy and business-centric to stylish, versatile platforms for a new generation of professionals, creatives, and students.</p>\n<p>That brings us to the topic of price, which will likely have many potential buyers balking. The Surface Studio is clearly an expensive product, with the starting configuration alone at $2,999, but it’s priced relatively competitively when you look at what you’re getting. Comparably sized drawing displays don’t double as powerful computers or feature the Studio’s engineering, but they still cost upward of $2,000. For example, the 27-inch Wacom QHD Cintiq is $2,799, and though you can hook it up to a PC or Mac for digital creation, you’ll still need to buy that computer. When you account for graphics, processing, storage, and a super-high-resolution display, the Studio’s price actually starts to look reasonable.</p>\n<h3><b>PORTS AND PERIPHERALS</b></h3><p>All ports are located on the back of the base. They’re a bit difficult to access, particularly when the screen is reclined, since you have to reach around it or turn the whole machine around. But this placement keeps the flush, sleek look intact. There are four USB 3.0 ports (one is a high-power port), an SD card reader, a mini DisplayPort connection, and a headset jack. USB-C connectivity is notably absent.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0068-0124/146841-1-eng-US/f0068-012.jpg\" width=\"1454\" height=\"679\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0068-01\" title=\"f0068-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>CONNECTIONS</b></p>\n<p><b>The Studio has four USB 3.0 ports (one is a high power port), an SD card reader, a mini DisplayPort connection, and a headset jack, all located on the rear.</b></p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>The Studio comes with a wireless keyboard and wireless mouse, both of which connect via Bluetooth 4.0. These are also very iMac-like in look and feel, and they get the job done. I don’t find the low-profile mouse particularly comfortable, but Apple faithfuls likely won’t mind it. The keyboard is satisfying to type on.</p>\n<p>The Surface Pen stylus is also included. It works well with the Studio, with little to no latency between strokes and response on the screen. The “eraser” button is customizable, as is a skinny strip along the side you can set as right click, paste, or something else, depending on your workflow. By default it brings up the Windows Ink Workspace software for quickly launching into note-taking and drawing. Magnetic strips on either side of the display, like the Surface Pro, attach the Pen when it’s not in use.</p>\n<p>We also tested the Surface Dial ($99), though it isn’t included. The Dial is not an instrument for drawing but is an aid for tool and menu selection. You can press and spin the Dial to scroll through various on-screen options. Placing it directly on the display and pressing down brings up a digital radial menu around the physical Dial, with options including Volume, Brightness, and Undo, all of which looks and feels very futuristic. It doesn’t take long to learn how to use the Dial; I was flipping between settings and changing tools with ease within a few minutes. Whether it will speed up your process depends on your workflow, but it helped me save time.</p>\n<p>The bottom of the Dial is rubber to help grip the screen, but I found that it slowly slides down when the Studio is at any angle other than fully reclined. This shouldn’t be a problem most of the time—the Dial will most likely be used alongside the Pen in Studio Mode. Keeping the bottom clean helps grip, and the Dial also works when it’s simply sitting on your desk.</p>\n<p>Beyond the peripherals, the Studio integrates 802.11ac Wi-Fi and wireless support for Xbox controllers (connecting them to a PC typically requires you to purchase Microsoft’s Wireless Adapter). You also get two front-facing cameras. One is a 5-megapixel cam for Windows Hello sign-in. When you set up Hello, it scans your face once and recognizes you in the future, allowing you to log in by standing in front of the screen instead of typing in a password. The other 1080p camera is for video chats.</p>\n<p class=\"pullQuote\"><b>The Studio’s design and functionality are praise-worthy, but I have a few reservations about its components.</b></p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0070-0125/146834-1-eng-US/f0070-012.jpg\" width=\"917\" height=\"567\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0070-01\" title=\"f0070-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>DIALING IN</b></p>\n<p><b>The Dial is an aid for tool and menu selection.

They’re of better quality than most built-in speakers on standalone displays, though certainly not on a par with those on the room-shaking Dell XPS 27 AIO.</p>\n<h3><b>UNDER THE HOOD</b></h3><p>The Studio’s design and functionality are praiseworthy, but I have a few reservations about its components. It’s a fast system by any measure, but considering the high-stress workloads of creative users, some inclusions could be cause for concern.</p>\n<p>Though generally speedy, thanks in part to 32GB of memory, the Core i7 Skylake processor and GTX 980M graphics card are a generation behind. This could be because the Studio has been in development through the launch of newer components (using a Kaby Lake CPU or Pascal graphics would have presumably delayed its release). Cost concerns or engineering obstacles could also be the culprits. Either way, the Surface Studio’s internal hardware isn’t quite cutting edge, which is disappointing for the price, and a (likely inevitable) refreshed version with newer components would really knock it out of the park.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0071-0126/146827-1-eng-US/f0071-012.jpg\" width=\"1219\" height=\"692\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0071-01\" title=\"f0071-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>DIGITAL DRAFTING BOARD</b></p>\n<p><b>The Surface Studio’s convertibility is what makes this high-end all-in-one desktop a good artist’s workstation. With the display folded down, it becomes infinitely easier to draw directly on the screen compared with a traditional upright monitor.</b></p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>Storage comes in the form of a hybrid drive similar to Apple’s fusion format. Our test unit includes a 2TB drive, while the base and midrange models each include 1TB. Rather than provide solid-state storage (not an option on any of the Studio’s configurations), Microsoft includes a hybrid hard drive that utilizes an SSD cache, but data is stored on the 5,400rpm hard drive. In spite of this, and a bit to my surprise, load times were still comparable with those of solid-state storage. The computer boots very quickly, and programs launch with little or no delay.</p>\n<p>This leads to the issue of expandability, which is something you’ll have to live without if you buy the Studio. Like most all-in-ones, the machine is ready-to-go as ordered and will stay exactly that way, since you can’t open it up to add more RAM or storage. That might be enough to deter some potential buyers, since it’s an expensive product you won’t be able to upgrade down the road, but it’s nothing new for the category or for anyone who’s worked on an iMac. External and cloud storage will be your friends (as they likely already are for artists), even with the roomy drive.</p>\n<h3><b>PERFORMANCE</b></h3><p>Just how fast is the Surface Studio? It’s plenty zippy, especially since the gap between the Skylake and Kaby Lake processors is not nearly as pronounced as some generations past. The 2.7GHz Intel Core i7-6820HQ CPU and 32GB of memory powered it to a strong score on the PCMark 8 Work Conventional productivity test, even at its demanding native resolution.</p>\n<p>Multimedia test scores were also solid. It completed the Handbrake test in 1 minute and 3 seconds, Photoshop in 3:03, and scored 702 points on CineBench. These results were all faster than the 2015 5K iMac (1:15, 3:19, and 510 points), but not by the margin you’d hope for a newer, pricey desktop.</p>\n<p class=\"pullQuote\"><b>This leads to the issue of expandability, which is something you’ll have to live without if you buy the Studio.</b></p>\n<p>That extends to the last-gen graphics hardware as well, though it matters a bit less since this isn’t a gaming system. A 980M was among the best graphics hardware for laptops last generation, so it’s a capable 3D card and a lot better than integrated graphics. Gaming isn’t the Studio’s purpose, but 3D performance for model rendering and manipulation (say, for CAD, architectural, and medical use) is aided by the GPU, so high-powered discrete graphics fits the bill.</p>\n<p>It is still a mobile card, though, so it can’t go toe-to-toe with gaming desktops like the Corsair One Pro or even the Digital Storm Aura, which is also an all-in-one. That said, the Studio is a capable performer at 1080p, averaging 55 frames per second (fps) on the Heaven and Valley gaming tests on Ultra-quality settings in HD. Don’t expect it to run much in native resolution (though few computers could do so smoothly), but you can definitely manage some high-setting HD gaming on the side. It’s not VR-ready, however, since the Pascal GTX 1060 graphics card is the recommended entry point for virtual reality gaming, and the 980M does not reach that mark.</p>\n<h3><b>CONCLUSION</b></h3><p>The Surface Studio delivers on Microsoft’s vision of creating a digital drafting board and an efficient desktop in a single package. On top of that unique proposition, it’s a beautiful and cleverly designed piece of hardware with a stunning display.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0073-0126/146820-1-eng-US/f0073-012.jpg\" width=\"916\" height=\"567\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0073-01\" title=\"f0073-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p class=\"pullQuote\"><b>Growing pains are to be expected as a new product type is introduced, yet the core concept is well executed.</b></p>\n<p>I have some misgivings about the component decisions, but that doesn’t mean the system is slow or not up to the task. Growing pains are to be expected as a new product type is introduced, yet the core concept is well executed. It’s a successful proof of concept in Microsoft’s bid for reinventing both the digital artist’s workspace and the perception and function of Windows as a creator’s platform.</p>\n<p>You might want to wait for Version 2.0 with newer parts if you’re concerned about performance. But I can assure you that in its current form, the Microsoft Surface Studio is a joy to use and work on. It’s a beautiful, innovative marriage of form and function, and an easy Editors’ Choice.</p>\n<p class=\"byline\"><b>MATTHEW BUZZI</b></p>\n","layout":{},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":0,"link_source":"","competition":[],"flatplan_title":"","notes":"","gutter_credit":"","other":"","image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1493839929.8006","name":"f0065-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0065-0124/146869-1-eng-US/f0065-012.jpg?t=default_ipad_portrait&ext/f0065-012_default_ipad_portrait.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"768","height":"663","legacy_id":"12264","is_default":true},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1493839929.8006","name":"f0065-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0065-0124/146869-1-eng-US/f0065-012.jpg?t=default_ipad_landscape&ext/f0065-012_default_ipad_landscape.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"889","height":"768","legacy_id":"12264","is_default":false}],"related_objects":{"image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_7_1493839920.7868","name":"f0073-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0073-0126/146820-1-eng-US/f0073-012.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"916","height":"567","legacy_id":"12257"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_7_1493839920.7868","name":"f0073-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0073-0126/146820-1-eng-US/f0073-012.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"916","height":"567","legacy_id":"12257"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_6_1493839921.8292","name":"f0071-01","source":"","caption":"<p><b>DIGITAL DRAFTING BOARD</b></p>\n<p><b>The Surface Studio’s convertibility is what makes this high-end all-in-one desktop a good artist’s workstation.

lightweight entertainment projector with an excellent set of connection choices. It even has a built-in TV tuner for connecting to a set-top box or an over-the-air antenna. Video quality is among the best I have seen in an LED projector, and data image quality is above par, too. It’s a clear pick for our Editors’ Choice portable palmtop projector.</p>\n<h3><b>DESIGN AND FEATURES</b></h3><p>The PH550 is a DLP-based model with an LED light source rated for 30,000 hours, so it should last the lifetime of the projector. It provides 720p (1,280-by-720) native resolution at a 16:9 aspect ratio, and has a rated brightness of 550 lumens, which is typical for palmtop projectors and somewhat lower than the 800-lumen rating of the LG Compact Pebble Design Smart Minibeam Projector PW800.</p>\n<p>Measuring 1.7 by 6.9 by 4.3 inches (HWD) and weighing just 1.4 pounds, the PH550 is a compact and lightweight projector. It is also pretty, with a glossy white case with rounded covers and the lens inset in a copper-colored ring. On top, just behind the lens, is a focus lever that easily bring the projector to a good focus. It lacks a zoom, however. Also on top is a four-way controller with a central button. Pressing the button powers up the projector, but only after you have turned on the On-Off switch in back.</p>\n<p>Also in back is a good selection of ports. The single HDMI port also supports MHL for streaming video from an MHL-enabled smartphone or tablet. There is a USB Type-A port, which fits a USB thumb drive from which you can show photos or videos or play music files. An AV-in jack lets you connect to a DVD player or other source via composite audio/video using an included adapter cable. An audio-out jack fits a plug for headphones or powered external speakers. There’s also a VGA port for connecting to a computer and a slot for a Kensington lock.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0075-0122/146905-1-eng-US/f0075-012.jpg\" width=\"1018\" height=\"485\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0075-01\" title=\"f0075-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>TV TUNER</b></p>\n<p><b>The coaxial plug at right fits a cable to connect the built-in TV tuner to an over-the-air antenna or a set-top box.</b></p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p><b>LG Minibeam LED Projector</b></p>\n<p><b>(PH550)</b></p>\n<p><b>PROS Compact and lightweight. Good video and data image quality. Stylish. Abundant port selection. Bluetooth connectivity. Built-in TV tuner. Rechargeable internal battery.</b></p>\n<p><b>CONS 720p resolution is relatively low for an entertainment projector. Modest brightness. Soft audio. No zoom.</b></p>\n<h3><b>TELEVISION TOO</b></h3><p>Last but not least, a coaxial connector for the projector’s built-in TV tuner lets you connect to a cable box or an over-the-air antenna, so you can project TV programming onto your screen. The PH550 is capable of substituting for a flat-screen TV in a family room, though its relatively low resolution (720p, in an increasingly 1080p and 4K world) and modest brightness make it less than ideal for that role. LG does offer brighter 1080p projectors with TV tuners, such as the LG Portable LED Projector With Smart TV and Magic Remote PF1500, which is rated at 1,400 lumens, and the 1,000-lumen Editors’ Choice LG Minibeam Ultra Short Throw Projector With Smart TV (PF1000U). They are larger and heavier than the PH550 but still portable, though neither has a built-in battery. The PH550’s video image looked bright when it filled our test screen, about 80 inches measured diagonally, though when ambient light was introduced, a more comfortable viewing size was about 64 inches.</p>\n<p>The PH550 has built-in Bluetooth—rather rare on a mobile projector—for connecting to an external Bluetooth speaker. Through the projector’s Screen Share function, you can wirelessly mirror the screen of an Android or Windows computer or mobile device via Miracast or WiDi.</p>\n<p>A full-size remote lets you access Screen Share or Bluetooth, switch between TV channels, change input sources, and control many other functions. The projector can be powered by a built-in rechargeable battery, which gets you through most normal-length movies; LG estimates it can last 2.5 hours on a charge, and my experience bears that out.</p>\n<h3><b>DATA, VIDEO, AND AUDIO</b></h3><p>Data image quality is above average. The PH550 fared well in our text testing, with white text on black easily readable down to 7.5 points and black text on white easily readable down to 9 points. Color balance was also very good.</p>\n<p>Video quality was strong for a portable projector of moderate brightness. I saw occasional rainbow artifacts—little red-green-blue streaks that typically appear in bright areas against dark backgrounds—but fewer than typical for an LED-based DLP projector. Color balance was excellent, and colors were well saturated without being overly so. (Frequently, colors from low-brightness LED projectors are oversaturated to the point of garishness.)</p>\n<p>Sound from the PH550’s pair of 1-watt speakers is soft, suitable for a very small room. Should you want louder audio, you can always connect a set of powered external speakers to the audio-out jack. Even better, you can connect wirelessly to a Bluetooth speaker.</p>\n<p class=\"pullQuote\"><b>The PH550 has unusually good video quality for an LED-based projector and good data image quality as well.</b></p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0077-0125/146898-1-eng-US/f0077-012.jpg\" width=\"1234\" height=\"609\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0077-01\" title=\"f0077-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>CONCLUSION</b></h3><p>Small, versatile, and capable of both home and portable use, the LG Minibeam LED Projector (PH550) has unusually good video quality for an LED-based projector and good data image quality as well. Its built-in TV tuner and coaxial connector let you connect to a cable box or over-the-air antenna for home or portable TV-show projecting onto a screen, and it has a wealth of other connectivity options. The PH550 doesn’t quite manage the brightness of the LG PW800, but it can be powered from its rechargeable battery and connected to a Bluetooth speaker, two features that the other model lacks. Our longtime top pick for best palmtop projector, the InFocus LightPro IN1146, is no longer available, and the PH550 is a worthy replacement as Editors’ Choice.</p>\n<p class=\"byline\"><b>TONY HOFFMAN</b></p>\n","layout":{},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":0,"link_source":"","competition":[],"flatplan_title":"","notes":"","gutter_credit":"","other":"","image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1493839934.616","name":"f0074-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0074-0125/146919-1-eng-US/f0074-012.jpg?t=default_ipad_portrait&ext/f0074-012_default_ipad_portrait.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"768","height":"249","legacy_id":"12270","is_default":true},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1493839934.616","name":"f0074-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0074-0125/146919-1-eng-US/f0074-012.jpg?t=default_ipad_landscape&ext/f0074-012_default_ipad_landscape.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"1024","height":"332","legacy_id":"12270","is_default":false}],"related_objects":{"image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_3_1493839931.6416","name":"f0077-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0077-0125/146898-1-eng-US/f0077-012.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"1234","height":"609","legacy_id":"12267"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_3_1493839931.6416","name":"f0077-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0077-0125/146898-1-eng-US/f0077-012.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"1234","height":"609","legacy_id":"12267"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_2_1493839932.6645","name":"f0075-01","source":"","caption":"<p><b>TV TUNER</b></p>\n<p><b>The coaxial plug at right fits a cable to connect the built-in TV tuner to an over-the-air antenna or a set-top box.</b></p>\n","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0075-0122/146905-1-eng-US/f0075-012.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"1018","height":"485","legacy_id":"12268"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_2_1493839932.6645","name":"f0075-01","source":"","caption":"<p><b>TV TUNER</b></p>\n<p><b>The coaxial plug at right fits a cable to connect the built-in TV tuner to an over-the-air antenna or a set-top box.</b></p>\n","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0075-0122/146905-1-eng-US/f0075-012.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"1018","height":"485","legacy_id":"12268"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_1_1493839933.7411","name":"f0074-02","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0074-023/146912-1-eng-US/f0074-022.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"209","height":"29","legacy_id":"12269"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_1_1493839933.7411","name":"f0074-02","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0074-023/146912-1-eng-US/f0074-022.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"209","height":"29","legacy_id":"12269"}]},"url_alias":"http://pcmagazine-us.audiencemedia.com","type":"story","order":"15","folio_number":"74","folio_numbers":"74,75,76,77","pdf_page_index":"74","thumbnail":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0074-0125/146919-1-eng-US/f0074-012.jpg?t=tablet_story_thumbnail&ext/f0074-012_tablet_story_thumbnail.jpg","color":"FFFFFF","real_id":"12266","main_section_id":"854","ads":[]},{"id":"zinio_253_100340926_1493839936.028","title":"Five Top All-in-One Desktops","sub_title":"","author":[{"id":"0","name":"MATTHEW MURRAY","email":"noreply@audiencemedia.com","is_default":false}],"tag":"","strap_line":"REVIEWS / HARDWARE","intro":"","body":"\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0078-0125/147025-1-eng-US/f0078-012.jpg\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1001\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0078-01\" title=\"f0078-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p><b>S</b>o the 15-inch display on your laptop is starting to feel cramped, and you work mainly in one location. You could attach an additional screen to your notebook or opt for a desktop tower with a separate monitor, but you have another option: an all-in-one (AIO) desktop. For about the same amount of money you’d spend on a midrange-to-high-end laptop with a 17-inch screen (or more likely, less), you can get an AIO desktop PC with a 23-inch-or-larger screen. Here’s what to consider when shopping for an all-in-one PC. (Also, take a look at our review of the Microsoft Surface Studio AIO in this issue.).</p>\n<h3><b>DISPLAY</b></h3><p>The first thing to look for in an all-in-one is the screen. Lower-priced AIO PCs come with 20-inch screens, but those are better suited to cramped spaces such as classroom labs or dorm rooms. What you really want is a display at least 23 inches on the diagonal—and larger is better, if you can manage it. (The biggest all-in-ones we’ve seen to date have had curved 34-inch screens.) You’re almost guaranteed a 1,920-by-1,080-resolution (full HD) screen at this size, and larger screens will go even higher—up to 4K in many cases, or 3,440 by 1,440 on an ultra-wide display.</p>\n<p>That gives you the ability to view multiple windows side by side or view a three- to four-page-wide spreadsheet. And if you’re a multitasker, the more screen room, the better. Though it’s not a concern for those with 20/10 or better vision, a larger screen and higher resolution let you increase the font size on your Word documents and Excel spreadsheets, while still keeping a lot of information on the screen.</p>\n<p>Desktop screens are brighter than laptop displays in general, as well. Look for In-Plane Switching (IPS) technology for the best screen quality. IPS screens are inherently better at off-axis viewing, which means you won’t have to be sitting perfectly centered to see accurate colors and all the detail in your images.</p>\n<h3><b>TOUCH-SCREEN AIOS</b></h3><p>The tiled Start interface in Windows 10 was designed with touch screens in mind and makes interacting with your various applications as easy as it’s ever been. But although these can be fun and functional for families, a touch screen isn’t 100 percent necessary (yet). That’s especially true for those who plan to use the all-in-one like a traditional computer, in which case a keyboard and mouse work better.</p>\n<p>Some touch gestures in macOS as well could take advantage of a touch screen, but for Macs, it’s also not a necessity. Scrolling with a mouse or a touchpad is still as quick or quicker than scrolling on a touch screen. Selecting text for copy and paste is easier with a mouse. If you fill out forms online and switch between text-entry boxes, pull-down menus, and checkboxes, then it’s likely that you’ll be able to enter data more quickly with a keyboard and mouse or touchpad.</p>\n<p>If you’re planning on using the touch screen at least 50 percent of the time, look for systems with screens that can recline down to horizontal (90 degrees) or almost horizontal. This lets you use the system like a large tablet, so you don’t have to hold your arm out constantly to use the touch screen. It’s simple ergonomics.</p>\n<p>Some AIO stands let you pivot the screen into a portrait orientation. Portrait mode lets you view content such as webpages and some pictures without wasted space to the sides of the screen. It’s a boon for Web developers and layout artists working on print publications. If Portrait mode is something you want, make sure the system features auto-rotate; without it, you’ll need to switch display settings every time you pivot the display.</p>\n<p class=\"pullQuote\"><b>Some touch gestures in macOS as well could take advantage of a touch screen, but for Macs, it’s also not a necessity.</b></p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0080-0120/147018-1-eng-US/f0080-012.jpg\" width=\"605\" height=\"489\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0080-01\" title=\"f0080-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>COMPONENTS AND PERIPHERALS</b></h3><p>You can get a dual-core processor in a base configuration, but we recommend you look for a true quad-core processor on a large-screen AIO PC. It helps with editing photos and videos or playing music in the background while you work on several tasks in the foreground. The minimum system memory you should accept is about 6GB to 8GB. Although 4GB is fine for basic users, you’ll feel the limits of such a system. That said, 8GB or 16GB lets you keep dozens of tabs open on your browser and still have room left over for Photoshop.</p>\n<p>As for storage, if you’re going to store any video on your PC, bear in mind that videos tend to clog up hard drives faster than just about any other type of file. Look for a hard drive of at least 1TB capacity; heavy download fans should grab a 2TB drive. The only issue is that a traditional spinning hard drive is relatively slow booting and loading apps.</p>\n<p>For a system that’s more a speed demon than a file storage unit, look for an AIO that uses a solid-state drive (SSD) as the boot drive. If you keep all your files on a central network-attached storage (NAS) device or stored on in the cloud, just about any SSD or hard drive larger than 128GB will be sufficient. That’s enough for the operating system and a handful of frequently used programs.</p>\n<p>You can have the best of both worlds with an all-in-one PC that boots from a SSD but has an additional spinning hard drive for storage. Power users should look for a 128GB boot drive and at least 1TB of hard drive storage. You’ll need more storage (2TB to 4TB) to keep your entire video, music, and photo collection on your AIO.</p>\n<p>Adding an extra 1TB or so is also easy with an external drive. SSDs cost more per gigabyte than regular spinning hard drives, but SSDs boot up and wake from sleep much faster than regular drives. Adding a 32GB cache SSD can speed up some tasks—loading apps, for example. But for true speed, get a “real” SSD as your primary (C:) drive. Unfortunately, some of the new AIO PCs are hard to upgrade after checkout, so make sure you get what you need at the start.</p>\n<p>An all-in-one should have all the ports you need during your day-to-day activities, particularly USB (in easy-to-access places, if possible). You may also want an Ethernet port, though most all-in-ones today come with Wi-Fi support built in, so you can easily hook it up to the wireless network you already have in your home. Also handy is an HDMI input port, which gives you the flexibility to use the all-in-one as a display for a separate PC or other device.</p>\n<p>You’ll want a system with a wireless keyboard and mouse or touchpad. Although you could use the on-screen equivalents on a touch screen, using a touch screen for everything can get tiring, especially when you’re typing for more than a minute or two. It’s also easier to use a mouse or touchpad than a touch screen when selecting large blocks of text for cut/paste operations.</p>\n<p>Two new subcategories of AIOs have appeared recently. The first is the battery-equipped, portable all-in-one desktop. It uses mobile components including ultraportable-class processors, low-power storage devices such as SSDs, and touch screens to give you a tablet-like experience. These PCs run full versions of Windows and Windows-compatible software, so they’re more capable than most mobile devices. A built-in battery pack gives you a few hours of unplugged computing, but their 18- to 27-inch screens are way too large to use on an airline tray table. Better to think of them as portable PCs that you can move from room to room easily.</p>\n<p class=\"pullQuote\"><b>You might even be able to upgrade this type of all-in-one yourself, which would help future-proof it.</b></p>\n<p>The other newcomer are much larger machines that use desktop-caliber parts (such as processors and graphics cards) to offer you just as much power as you’d get in a full-size tower PC. You might even be able to upgrade this type of all-in-one yourself, which would help future-proof it against improvements in technology over the years you own it.</p>\n<h3><b>THE PROS OF AIOS</b></h3><p>Even if you can afford a 20-inch-or-larger laptop, you wouldn’t be able to carry it around without looking ridiculous. You’d also need strong arms to move a 17-inch-or-larger laptop, and you’d need to resemble a WWE wrestler to have a lap that could accommodate one. Since AIO desktops are plugged in, you can leave your system in sleep mode for months. Some AIO systems with SSDs can update while sleeping, like newer ultraportable laptops. Because they use more powerful processors, all-in-one PCs take care of your tasks quicker. Some 3D games are also smoother, thanks to discrete graphics cards in some AIO PCs.</p>\n<p>You can share the PC with family members and use it to store centrally accessible photos, music, and videos. A large widescreen AIO PC makes for a fine video conferencing system. Rather than having the family crowd around your 7-inch tablet or 11-inch laptop, seat them in front of a 27- or 34-inch AIO desktop, so you’re not squeezing together to “fit on the screen.” Also, a large screen is good for watching a movie from 10 feet away, so a few people can use it as a HDTV in your den equipped with a small sofa or loveseat. If you place the system in a central location, such as your kitchen counter, you can monitor your children when they’re online.</p>\n<h3><b>THE CONS</b></h3><p>Since they have large screens, AIO PCs are physically larger than laptops. Of course, with most AIOs, you give up the ability to move them easily from room to room, though they’re still more portable than tower PCs. All-in-one PCs don’t have the expandability that you’re going to find in most towers, but towers lack the sleekness factor. That said, towers are still better than all-in-one PCs when you need to do intensive work such as CAD/CAM or scientific exploration, and most of them are expandable in ways well beyond even the most generous AIO on the market.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0083-0125/147011-1-eng-US/f0083-012.jpg\" width=\"763\" height=\"569\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0083-01\" title=\"f0083-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>HP Envy Curved 34-A051 Signature Edition All-in-One</b></h3><p>$1,649.99</p>\n<p><b>EDITORS’ CHOICE</b></p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0046-028/147004-1-eng-US/f0046-022.jpg\" width=\"209\" height=\"29\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0046-02\" title=\"f0046-02\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>This system costs a pretty penny, but it offers a lot of power, storage, and features for the price.

The Envy Curved 34-A051 is more comfortable for multitasking than a traditional desktop with a dual-monitor setup, and it has the power to blaze through tasks, quickly. Plus, that 34-inch curved screen is just gorgeous.

The AiO Pro has more storage space and is a bit faster than the iMac we reviewed, but not to the point where Asus leaves Apple in the dust.

\t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p><b>M</b>icrosoft Photos, the free photo viewer and editor that comes with Windows 10, has been updated with with the Creators Update of the operating system (see our recap of the update in What’s New Now). It now combines decent image editing capabilities with additional filters and an even simpler, more touch-friendly interface. It also lets you mark up images with drawing, powers search with AI automatic object tagging, and even lets you trim video clips. Microsoft Photos is a delightful way to work with digital images, and could even replace higher-end photo software, though it lacks a few tricks, including face recognition and a map view.</p>\n<h3><b>STARTING UP</b></h3><p>The app is included with Windows 10, and it replaces the Windows Photo Gallery app of yore. You can no longer download the older app, which added panorama stitching, collage, and sharpening tools. If you’ve got Windows 10, you don’t need to do anything to get the newer app—like the OS X’s Photos app, it’s just there. If Photos isn’t among your Windows 10 PC’s apps, you can always get it from the Windows (app) Store. Note that Windows still comes with Paint, which is more about one-at-a-time image resizing, drawing, and saving to different image formats. Starting with Windows 10 Creators Update, you also get Paint 3D, which offers easy 3D modeling, decoration, and sharing.</p>\n<h3><b>CLEAR INTERFACE</b></h3><p>Photos’ interface has three main modes: Collection, Albums, and Folders. Collection is everything organized by date, and Albums are both automatically created ones and ones you create yourself. Folders shows images by file location. From any mode, you can click into an individual photo for viewing and editing. A handy back-arrow is always present at top left.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0087-0125/147068-1-eng-US/f0087-012.jpg\" width=\"951\" height=\"652\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0087-01\" title=\"f0087-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>COLLECTION MODE Photos’ Collection presents all the photos on your PC, whether they’re locally saved image files, screenshots, or OneDrive photo files, in date groups.</b></p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p><b>Microsoft Photos</b></p>\n<p><b>(for Windows 10)</b></p>\n<p><b>PROS Simple, touch-friendly interface. Fast. Good photo browsing features. Solid selection of image-correction tools. Automatically creates albums.</b></p>\n<p><b>CONS No star ratings. Lacks before-and-after view. Cannot tag faces. Does not support panorama stitching or selective focus.</b></p>\n<p>Microsoft Photos is geared toward simplicity and touchability. By contrast, Apple’s Photos app on the Mac supports only the limited though well implemented touch capabilities of the latest MacBooks’ Touch Bar. Zooming and unzooming are simple matters of a tap on the image or a spin of the mouse wheel. But I wish Microsoft Photos had a before-and-after viewing feature to take you back to the original during editing.</p>\n<p>A big change in Microsoft Photos’ interface is the use of horizontal sliders, which replace the circular dial controls used to adjust brightness and other options. The circular controls were innovative, but they did take some getting used to, while the sliders are completely familiar. Microsoft Photos has no trouble with high-DPI displays like that of my 4K-resolution Asus Zen AiO Pro Z240IC all-in-one PC test machine.</p>\n<h3><b>VIEWING AND ORGANIZING PHOTOS</b></h3><p>Any images in your Microsoft Photos user folder and its subfolders (including Screenshots) show up in the app. Videos in those folders also appear. You can add any other folders on your system to view their contents in the Folders section, as well as enabling viewing of OneDrive cloud folders. Including OneDrive means that any photos shot on smartphones set up with auto-upload appear in the Collection view. The Photos app also includes an Import option that works with any storage device you plug into the computer. It supports raw camera files, though those from newly released or uncommon models weren’t yet supported when I tested.</p>\n<p>One organization highlight is that Microsoft Photos creates albums for you based on date groupings, just as Apple Photos does with Memories. The difference is that in the Windows app, you can edit the albums to taste. Apple assumes it knows better than you, and it alone chooses which photos go in your Memories. Both let you share online galleries via a link.</p>\n<p>You can also create your own custom albums, and adding shots is a snap either from within the album or from photo view. When you’re viewing an individual photo, options include zoom, enhance, edit, and share. You can also play a slideshow or draw on the photo. The drawing tool works with mouse, stylus, or finger, and the selection of tips and colors is decent. The eraser, however, is a bit blunt, erasing only an entire stroke rather than letting you touch up your drawing.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0089-0121/147061-1-eng-US/f0089-012.jpg\" width=\"1215\" height=\"663\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0089-01\" title=\"f0089-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>ALBUMS YOUR WAY</b></p>\n<p><b>You can create Albums yourself or have the app create them for you automatically; it bases them on date groupings, and you can edit them afterward (which you can’t do with the albums created by Apple Photos).</b></p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>There are a few views missing that I’d like to see. For example, there’s no map view of all your geotagged photos, which includes nearly all mobile photos. You do, however, see a map location on individual photos’ File Info panels, available from a right-click. That also shows EXIF data and file dimensions.</p>\n<p>Nor is there a way to rate photos with stars or apply keyword tags, though you can do both of those things in File Explorer. But in a nice nod to moving picture support, you can trim the start and end of video clips in the Photos app and even draw on them as you can on photos. Those abilities hardly make up for Windows’ no longer including a real video-editing option, though.</p>\n<h3><b>EDITING PHOTOS</b></h3><p>The app’s Enhance tool is accessible right on the photo-viewer page, without making you go into the editing view. I found that it usually bumps up contrast and saturation, and often does make for a better-looking image, if one somewhat lacking in the drabness of reality. It’s pretty good with skies, knocking back highlights for a better look at the clouds. You can set Enhance to be applied to all photos by default, and turn it off later if you’re not pleased with the result. It did a really nice job correcting white balance on an overly warm indoor shot.</p>\n<p>When you enter Edit mode, a slider lets you adjust the automatic Enhance. There are also 15 more effects to play with (up from 5 in the last version), and the strength of each is adjustable, too. Four B&amp;W options are among them, with different levels of contrast and sharpness. It’s effective to apply one of these and scale back the slider for just a smidge of color. I was happy to see that the app lets you not only adjust exposure and contrast, but also highlights and shadows. Color editing is an option, too, as is the Clarity slider (similar to the one in Adobe Lightroom), which bumps up (and down) sharpness and black point.</p>\n<p>Microsoft Photos no longer offers a selective-focus (aka tilt-shift) tool as it did in its previous incarnation, but it does have simple and effective red-eye and blemish-removal tools, and a vignette slider is available in the Adjust tools.</p>\n<p>Once you’ve perfected your edits, you can either save a copy or overwrite the original. When just viewing rather than editing an image, however, there’s no option to save the picture as a different file type or to a different location.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0090-0118/147054-1-eng-US/f0090-012.jpg\" width=\"918\" height=\"476\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0090-01\" title=\"f0090-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>PHOTO FIX</b></p>\n<p><b>MIcrosoft Photo editing tools let you adjust light, highlights, shadow, contrast, exposure, color, and more.</b></p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>SHARING AND OUTPUT</b></h3><p>As mentioned above, you can build albums and share them as online galleries on OneDrive. The recipient doesn’t need a OneDrive account. For more ad-hoc sharing, simply hit the up-arrow icon to send the current image to any photo-accepting UWP app installed on your PC—Facebook, Messenger, WhatsApp, Twitter, and so on. The share panel has a new position in Windows 10 Creators Update, right in the center of the screen instead of off to the side as in earlier builds. Microsoft Photos has no built-in photo printing service, and the Windows apps for Snapfish, PhotoAffections, and Walgreens didn’t offer share targets at the time of testing. Big services Shutterfly, Winkflash, York, and RitzPix don’t even offer apps. The situation contrasts markedly with Apple Photos on macOS, which offers photo, book, and poster printing right from within the app. Of course, a simple website visit can get your Windows photos printed with the services mentioned above.</p>\n<p class=\"pullQuote\"><b>The app’s Enhance tool is accessible right on the photo-viewer page, without making you go into the editing view.</b></p>\n<p>A final sharing option is to send an album to Sway. This is an online Office component that lets you build a storytelling website. You can add titles and captions with lots of design choices. It also lets you add tweets and file downloads from Facebook and OneDrive, along with custom embed code.</p>\n<h3><b>CONCLUSION</b></h3><p>For viewing, tuning up, and sharing your digital photos, the free Microsoft Photos stands at the ready. After using photo programs loaded down with menus and panels and features, it can be a joy to use one that’s simple and clear and has what you need for basic viewing and fixes. For really powerful photo organization, optimization, and effects, you need a full-featured application such as CyberLink PhotoDirector or one of our Editors’ Choices—Photoshop Elements, Lightroom, or Photoshop CC. But for most users, most of the time, Microsoft Photos is a solid choice for managing, editing, and sharing photos.</p>\n<p class=\"byline\"><b>MICHAEL MUCHMORE</b></p>\n","layout":{},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":0,"link_source":"","competition":[],"flatplan_title":"","notes":"","gutter_credit":"","other":"","image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1493839953.4931","name":"f0086-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0086-0122/147082-1-eng-US/f0086-012.jpg?t=default_ipad_portrait&ext/f0086-012_default_ipad_portrait.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"768","height":"546","legacy_id":"12291","is_default":true},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1493839953.4931","name":"f0086-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0086-0122/147082-1-eng-US/f0086-012.jpg?t=default_ipad_landscape&ext/f0086-012_default_ipad_landscape.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"1024","height":"728","legacy_id":"12291","is_default":false}],"related_objects":{"image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_4_1493839949.1616","name":"f0090-01","source":"","caption":"<p><b>PHOTO FIX</b></p>\n<p><b>MIcrosoft Photo editing tools let you adjust light, highlights, shadow, contrast, exposure, color, and more.</b></p>\n","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0090-0118/147054-1-eng-US/f0090-012.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"918","height":"476","legacy_id":"12287"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_4_1493839949.1616","name":"f0090-01","source":"","caption":"<p><b>PHOTO FIX</b></p>\n<p><b>MIcrosoft Photo editing tools let you adjust light, highlights, shadow, contrast, exposure, color, and more.</b></p>\n","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0090-0118/147054-1-eng-US/f0090-012.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"918","height":"476","legacy_id":"12287"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_3_1493839950.3033","name":"f0089-01","source":"","caption":"<p><b>ALBUMS YOUR WAY</b></p>\n<p><b>You can create Albums yourself or have the app create them for you automatically;

As a result, your once-snappy machine may take longer to boot, crash with greater frequency, lock up more often, or experience an increased number of errors. tuneup utility Glary Utilities Pro leverages a collection of more than 20 tools to kick these problems to the curb. The app is easy to use and improves your system’s performance, but its license limitations and lack of software descriptions relegate it to the middle-of-the-pack status.</p>\n<h3><b>COST AND COMPATIBILITY</b></h3><p>Glary Utilities Pro is a lightweight application for Windows 10 8, 7, Vista, and XP computers that downloads and installs quickly. The software offers disk cleanup, registry repair, and junk-file removal tools, which is standard fare for tuneup utilities. It also has a handful of useful features not found in the free version of Glary Utilities, including automatic software updates and the ability to schedule tuneup times.</p>\n<p>On the down side, a Glary Utilities Pro subscription grants you just three licenses. That number is a decent amount, but if you live in a household with many computers, the license limitation may prove troublesome—and possibly costly. Iolo, on the other hand, lets you install its System Mechanic tuneup suite onto as many PCs as you’d like.</p>\n<h3><b>FEATURES</b></h3><p>You begin by initiating a system scan to identify problems on your PC. You can tackle all of the issues at once using Gary Utilities Pro’s 1-Click Maintenance feature, or you can choose to fix individual sections one at a time. Regardless of your approach, clicking the Repair Problems icon after the scans are complete begins the cleanup process. The tuneup time varies from a few minutes to a few hours, depending on your PC’s state of disarray. My worn test PC, with its out-of-date drivers, splintered registry, and hard drive full of junk, took close to an hour to clean.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0093-0121/147125-1-eng-US/f0093-012.jpg\" width=\"918\" height=\"495\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0093-01\" title=\"f0093-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>EXTRAS</b></p>\n<p><b>The Pro version of Glary Utilities includes automatic software updates and the ability to schedule tune-up times.</b></p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p><b>Glary Utilities Pro</b></p>\n<p><b>PROS Good system-performance improvement. Simple, easy-to-use interface. Lets you manage which programs launch when a PC boots. Built-in secure-deletion tool. Privacy-protecting features. Integrated driver updater.</b></p>\n<p><b>CONS License limitations. Lacks in-depth software descriptions.</b></p>\n<p>Glary Utilities Pro prompts you to remove unwanted software and junk files, but unlike SlimWare Utilities SlimCleaner Plus, it doesn’t provide detailed descriptions, which is a missed opportunity for educating subscribers. Many—if not most—people will simply delete items without much thought, which can be risky. Fortunately, Glary Utilities Pro has backup and restore functionality that may prove a technological godsend for those moments when you carelessly bork your PC and need to turn back the clock.</p>\n<p>The program also lacks community-based ratings that can help you determine which apps you should keep. I prefer SlimWare Utilities’ much more informative approach, which helps you decide what should be removed and teaches you about programs’ functions, too.</p>\n<p>On the upside, Glary Utilities Pro contains an incredibly helpful driver updater that seeks out fresh drivers when the ones that are installed on your PC go out of date. Glary Utilities Pro identified half a dozen dust-covered, outdated drivers on my test system and downloaded the newest versions so that my hardware and software could return to peak operating efficiency.</p>\n<p>You can schedule tuneup times so that Glary Utilities Pro handles the cleaning and repair tasks at specified hours. This isn’t an unusual feature—Anvisoft Cloud System Booster, CCleaner Professional Plus, and other quality tuneup utilities have this feature—but it’s always welcome.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0094-0123/147118-1-eng-US/f0094-012.jpg\" width=\"1106\" height=\"747\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0094-01\" title=\"f0094-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>LOOK BEFORE YOU CLICK</b></p>\n<p><b>Be careful when deleting items that you don’t get rid of something your PC might need to run.</b></p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>Other useful features include the Startup Manager and File Shredder tools. The former lets you limit the software that launches as your PC boots, thus reducing boot time. The latter securely overwrites deleted files so that they’re very difficult to recover. It’s a feature that proves useful when it comes time to get rid of sensitive data, such as tax-preparation information.</p>\n<p>Glary Utilities Pro’s many features are easy to access and activate. The tuneup package has an easy-to-understand interface that makes navigation a breeze. Its blue-and-white color scheme is easy on the eyes, too, which is one of the more overlooked aspects of utility software. Just because you’re working in your PC’s trenches doesn’t mean the software you’re using can’t also look good!</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0095-0122/147111-1-eng-US/f0095-012.jpg\" width=\"920\" height=\"626\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0095-01\" title=\"f0095-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>TESTING GROUNDS</b></h3><p>I tested Glary Utilities Pro’s PC-improvement chops by performing two tests— running the Geekbench system performance tool and measuring boot times— before and after running the tuneup utility suite. I ran each test three times and averaged the results. Before Glary applied its magic to my laptop (a 2GHz Intel Core i7 X990 Style-Note notebook with Windows 7, 4GB of RAM, and an 80GB Intel SSD drive), the system achieved a 5,914 Geekbench score and booted in 50.3 seconds.</p>\n<p>My testbed’s performance improved after I ran Glary Utilities Pro. The GeekBench score rose to 6,111 (a bit behind SlimCleaner Plus’ 6,218 mark) and the boot time decreased to 45.2 seconds (a bit behind Iolo System Mechanic’s 44.2 seconds).</p>\n<p>Those numbers represent solid improvements, but they wouldn’t mean a thing if they didn’t have any swing—and fortunately, they do. After running Glary Utilities Pro, my testbed opened windows and apps with an extra pep that wasn’t present when the machine was packed with crap. Even Steam and the notoriously bloated iTunes felt snappier. Still, Iolo System Mechanic and SlimCleaner Plus offer superior all-around performance enhancements that are reflected in both their better performance numbers and the superior responsiveness of the PCs they tune up.</p>\n<p class=\"pullQuote\"><b>Its blue-and-white color scheme is easy on the eyes, too, which is one of the more overlooked aspects of utility software.</b></p>\n<h3><b>CONCLUSION</b></h3><p>Glary Utilities Pro is a capable tuneup utility that invigorates junked-up PCs with its defragmentation, deletion, and boot-up management tools. The software should do more to stand out from the competition, though. Should Glarysoft update a future version of Utilities Pro so that it offers software descriptions and unlimited licenses, it could join Iolo System Mechanic and SlimWare Utilities SlimCleaner Plus as our Editors’ Choice picks. For now, Glary Utilities Pro is a solid choice, but it’s not the best you can get.</p>\n<p class=\"byline\"><b>JEFFREY L.
