People are usually great at producing obvious body-language signals that indicate they’re also waiting for a stranger, but Candice wouldn’t be looking for me: She’d be listening. She did display a few great cues, thankfully. A patient, doe-eyed Labrador retriever named Austria rested by her side, and a clutch of electronic gadgets were spread before her on the table.</p>\n<p>Candice also had a Google Glass headset perched on the bridge her nose. It was this that I’d really come to talk to her about. After we exchanged pleasantries, she gave me a quick rundown on her recent life—one in which smart assistive technology is playing an increasingly important role. AI-enabled eyesight services, smart hearing aids, and other intuitive, connected technology is changing the game for people with disabilities.</p>\n<h3><b>VISION QUEST</b></h3><p>Candice lost her sight entirely in college in 1998, at the age of 21, waking up blind one morning after months of declining vision because of worsening, inoperable cataracts. She worked with her university to complete her degree in psychology and then obtained a master’s degree in rehabilitation counseling; she’s been working for the District of Columbia government’s Rehabilitation Services Administration since 2007.</p>\n<p>So why Google Glass? Candice uses it with Aira, a new service she subscribes to: It connects her with a human agent who uses video feed from the headset or a phone’s camera to describe her environment for her and help navigate her through it. The agent also has access to a dashboard of data about her preferences, multiple maps, and information about her physical location. Aira can tell her as much or as little as she wants to know about her surroundings.</p>\n<p>Suman Kanuganti, CEO and founder of Aira, said his concept arose from a time he was on a phone-camera video call with a visually impaired friend. He asked his friend to hold his phone camera up, facing outward from his head, and then proceeded to describe what he saw in the friend’s kitchen to him. On subsequent calls, they performed the exercise outdoors using a Google Glass headset Kanuganti had acquired.</p>\n<p>“I was walking with him as I sat in San Diego, and I realized I can pull up maps and other information for him while he’s moving,” Kanuganti said. “He said, ‘Suman, what we’re doing is for fun, but there are millions of blind people for whom a service like this would be life-changing.’”</p>\n<p>Candice and I decided to go shopping. She handed me her Google Glass and phone and told me to have at it. I really wasn’t sure where to start, but the agent she connected with that day, Patrick, took the lead.</p>\n<p>He described the store we were in, telling me where I could find the ordering counter and providing some details about what was on the walls and who was immediately nearby. We then made our way to the exit (the door swung outward, Patrick noted). Then we were in a bright courtyard ringed by shops, where Patrick told us it was 49 degrees and sunny.</p>\n<p class=\"pullQuote\"><b>She gave me a rundown on her recent life—one in which smart assistive technology is playing an increasingly important role.</b></p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0099-0123/147210-1-eng-US/f0099-012.jpg\" width=\"920\" height=\"1021\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0099-01\" title=\"f0099-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>Candice Jordan navigates a potentially confusing retail environment with the help of Aira and Google Glass (and her guide dog, Austria).

Candice asked what other stores were around; when he mentioned a housewares outlet, she asked him to direct us there so she could look for a stovetop griddle.</p>\n<p>Armed again with her headset and phone, Candice followed the ensuing left-right- straight-ahead directions, avoiding obstacles with Austria’s help and alerts from Patrick. She stepped gingerly down into a curb cut when Patrick told her it was there; as we waited at a crosswalk, he had her scan left and right so he could look for oncoming vehicles. All clear.</p>\n<p>In the housewares store, she switched to using her phone’s camera when the Wi-Fi connection fizzled, causing Patrick’s video feed to freeze. The highlight of our day, Candice said, was the moment when a store clerk stopped by and asked if she needed any help.</p>\n<p>“I love being able to say, ‘No, I’ve got it, thanks!’ when people ask me that now,” Candice said. “Before, any time I needed anything in a store, I’d have to find customer service, wait for them to bring someone to help me, then have them go through my list. And because you need help, so often you have to be nice, and kind of market yourself, and educate them. Well, if it’s Saturday at 7 a.m. and it’s the only time I have to go to the grocery store, who wants to do all that? Now I don’t need to.”</p>\n<p class=\"pullQuote\"><b>The ability to connect to myriad streams of data is playing heavily into how these products and applications are being developed,</b></p>\n<h3><b>TECH ENABLEMENT</b></h3><p>According to a 2010 report from the U.S. Census, more than 56 million people, or nearly 20 percent of the nation’s population, are living with a physical or cognitive impairment of some kind. Aira is just one example of an emerging segment of smart technology that’s being designed specifically with this population in mind. The ability to connect to myriad streams of data, whether through a new piece of hardware or software and apps for devices, is playing heavily into how these products and applications are being developed, with the goal of helping people lead more independent, inclusive, and fulfilling lives.</p>\n<p>The array of available solutions is dizzying. Lechal, which started as a navigation aid for the visually impaired, has developed GPS-connected shoes with haptics feedback: They buzz to help you navigate as you walk. New Jersey-based Oticon makes a set of smart hearing aids that can be programmed to prompt other devices in your home to perform a cascade of tasks according to your proximity or time of day—automatically closing the garage door, locking the house, and turning the thermostat down when you leave for work, for example.</p>\n<p>In Europe, SpeechCode created a system to produce highly detailed QR codes that can be included on packaging, signage, or any other printed material. When scanned by the user via an app (which helps locate and center the code), the text from the package or sign encoded in the code is translated to an audio file available in 40 different languages. And Dimple, a programmable stick-on button for Android devices, uses near-field communication (NFC) to launch apps, phone settings, and even control other smart home appliances at a touch.</p>\n<p>Myriad other devices exist to help individuals adapt to their particular disability. As illustration, a single adaptive-tech loan program at Easter Seals of Massachusetts’ Assistive Technology Regional Center holds 1,200 devices for people to borrow and test out. High-tech options include eyegaze devices (these help you to access a computer or communication aid by controlling a mouse with your eyes), text-to-speech machines, and smartwatch-like wristbands that relay mobile phone messages. The overall concept is to enable people with disabilities to automate aspects of their lives that are otherwise cumbersome, as well as to make information more easily accessible.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0102-0121/147196-1-eng-US/f0102-012.jpg\" width=\"920\" height=\"513\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0102-01\" title=\"f0102-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>Zachary Campbell, right, raised money to purchase adaptive video gaming equipment for Easter Seals of Massachussetts’ Assistive Technology Regional Center.

Connected devices have tremendous potential to enable people to live as part of a community, instead of having to move to a more restricted environment where everything is brought to them.”</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0103-0121/147189-1-eng-US/f0103-012.jpg\" width=\"920\" height=\"889\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0103-01\" title=\"f0103-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>Matt Huenerfauth (right) records video and motion-capture data from a participant who is performing American Sign Language (ASL). (Photo credit: John Myer)</b></p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>It’s a robust topic of academic research and development, as well. At the Rochester Institute of Technology, Professor Matt Huenerfauth is working on developing tools such as an American Sign Language (ASL) trainer using a Microsoft Xbox Kinect camera. The system uses animations of common ASL gestures to “spellcheck” a learner’s signs: the user can copy the animation’s movements, and because the program can “see” the user’s movements via the Kinect camera, the software can flag or help the user correct errors in their signing. Huenerfauth is also investigating how speech-recognition technology could be used to produce captions automatically for one-on-one or small-group meetings between deaf and hearing participants.</p>\n<p>And at the Georgia Tech Institute for People and Technology, Executive Director Beth Mynatt recently spoke of research underway that uses sensing of the brain’s motor cortex to recognize the formation of individual words and phrases and translate them into machine-generated speech or text. This idea, too, emerged out of work with ASL. While researching how to read and translate brain signals, the team realized that the signal generated by a person physically signing an ASL letter or word was the same as when he or she thought about signing the letter. But as promising and as useful as recent innovations have been, they need to be more reliable, easier to use, and there for the long haul.</p>\n<p>“It’s tough to get individuals with disabilities to be the primary or initial adopters of some of these technologies, because if it fails, there are real consequences,” said Eric Oddleifson, assistant vice president of Assistive Technology and Employment Services at Easter Seals of Massachusetts. “Many times, people will opt for something they know will work rather than try something new that may not work in the long term.”</p>\n<h3><b>INFORMING DESIGN, CONNECTING SOLUTIONS</b></h3><p>One obstacle to adoption is the piecemeal nature of current solutions. There are lots of gadgets and apps out there that can communicate with your phone to relay information, or keep track of personal preferences, or automate your home. So maybe you have haptic shoes, if-this-then-that hearing aids, a smart thermostat, an Amazon Echo, and a dozen Wi-Fi-enabled LED light bulbs. And each one of them has its own app. At what point does managing all these solutions become more of an obstacle than the problem they’re meant to solve? Intelligent platforms that can integrate a mix of products and user interfaces into a single, easily accessible ecosystem are still largely lacking.</p>\n<p>Scott Moody is CEO of K4Connect, which has developed a smart-device ecosystem platform for people living with disabilities, called the K4Community, which can be used with nearly any connected device on the market across a variety of communications protocols.</p>\n<p>“Products are often designed for one demographic—say, millennials—and then an often-feeble attempt is made to adapt them,” he told me. “Each device and application is developed to solve a specific issue, but it can get to the point where one needs to have tens of apps or devices just to move around their living room. All these applications and devices need to work together—not just your home-automation products but your health, wellness, content, and communication devices, as well.”</p>\n<p>To Moody’s point about product design, often the needs of the disabled aren’t considered up front at all, even when the technology could, at its core, solve a key difficulty.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0105-0117/147182-1-eng-US/f0105-012.jpg\" width=\"1065\" height=\"619\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0105-01\" title=\"f0105-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>KR Liu speaks about innovations in affordable hearing technologies at CES 2017 in Las Vegas.

These wireless headphones use GPS and location information to shift volume and filter settings depending on whether the user is indoors, outdoors, at a concert, or in a library. Though it was initially conceived of as a “music curation” tool for users to customize live-music events, Liu’s presence on the team from very early on in the design process helped shape the earbuds into a product that could address multiple needs.</p>\n<p>“I was involved in helping them navigate what it would take to have our technology reach a consumer like myself,” Liu said. When the Here One earbuds were unveiled, the company received thousands of inquiries about whether the product could be used as assistive hearing devices.</p>\n<p>“There are consumers who need a little help in loud restaurants or an open office but don’t need a $5,000 hearing aid,” she said, some of whom may also have been drawn by the idea of having a listening booster without the stigma of a full-blown hearing aid.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0106-0123/147175-1-eng-US/f0106-012.jpg\" width=\"1065\" height=\"638\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0106-01\" title=\"f0106-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>With smart noise filters and software that learns users’ listening and sound profiles, Doppler Labs’ Here One earbuds are designed to enable users to tune into sounds they wish to hear and filter out the ones they don’t.

Wouldn’t it be nice if the big companies all had a person on their team, maybe with a disability, who could inform some of those design decisions?”</p>\n<p>That idea was a key tenet in the development process of a Braille smartwatch, and eventually, a Braille tablet, by the South Korean company Dot. One of Dot’s front-office workers is a blind individual who is active in the local vision-impaired community. He also served as Dot’s first line of testing for prototype tweaks, said Alex Lee, a company representative.</p>\n<p>“We go straight to him when there’s something new,” Lee said. “We say, ‘What do you think about this function? How would you change this?’” He has also brought friends and others from his mostly online community into Dot’s offices for beta testing and periodic chats with the engineers.</p>\n<p>Backed by a successful crowdfunding campaign and with the first units shipped in April, the low-profile Dot watch features four Braille characters, which are driven by magnetically controlled pins. Connected via Bluetooth to a user’s phone, the watch face can scroll through text messages, e-mails, and other short missives. And, of course, it tells time—but without the need for Siri to shout it out in a quiet room.</p>\n<p class=\"pullQuote\"><b>The Dot watch features four Braille characters, which are driven by magnetically controlled pins.</b></p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0107-0122/147168-1-eng-US/f0107-012.jpg\" width=\"1065\" height=\"651\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0107-01\" title=\"f0107-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>The Dot watch next to a phone displaying the Dot app on a white background.</b></p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>Its appearance as an accessory was also important, Lee said, because the company felt adaptive devices shouldn’t reflexively be clunky. Aira’s Kanuganti agreed, saying his company was in the process of developing a headset where style doesn’t take a backseat. He noted that the Aira service is agnostic, though, intended to work with any hardware the user chooses to use.</p>\n<p>“Think about how much these phone companies worry about the design of their handsets, but how often it’s actually just sitting in your pocket,” Kanuganti said. “But glasses—they’re on your face, and they’d better be cool.” Think Tom Ford frames but packing a quality camera, antennas, GPS, and proximity and altimeter sensors.</p>\n<h3><b>TAKING A WALK</b></h3><p>Eventually, Aira may be able to do even more for Candice. “Aira” is a portmanteau of the term AI (artificial intelligence) and the name of the ancient Egyptian sun god Ra, and the company eventually intends to use artificial intelligence to generate and communicate information to its subscribers based on their most common habits, routes, and routines. The goal is to draw upon image recognition technologies, information from previous conversations with agents, street and satellite maps, GPS, and physical location to augment and occasionally replace what a human agent relays to the Aira user.</p>\n<p>“We’re looking to leverage existing systems to do the work,” Kanuganti said. “You categorize individual tasks, then push your training system to automate those things.”</p>\n<p>For now, though, Candice is still chatting with Patrick and the other agents. And beyond what she describes as the “absolute freedom” that Aira has afforded her over the previous six months, she wasn’t expecting for it to restore one aspect of making her way through the world: just enjoying a walk, with no particular purpose or destination.</p>\n<p>When she met Kanuganti last fall on the National Mall in Washington to try Aira, the agent she connected with guided her from a subway entrance to one of the Smithsonian museums. And instead of just receiving directions, she asked what the agent could see. Orange and red leaves falling from the trees; a trash can to her left; someone walking toward her with a stroller and a baby in pink.</p>\n<p>“For the very first time, in I don’t know how long, I felt like I was talking a walk in the city that I live in and love,” Candice said. “It was a walk.

Instead, as he unveiled the new technology to the world, Microsoft’s Alex Kipman — creator of both the Microsoft Kinect motion controller and the HoloLens — showed a logo for Windows Holographic, the Windows 10-aligned software platform underpinning Microsoft’s AR ambitions.</p>\n<p>More than two years later, the software powering Microsoft’s growing AR device ecosystem is still the best indicator of where the company plans to take its mixed-reality (MR) future. It’s got a different name now—Microsoft re-branded Windows Holographic to Windows Mixed Reality—but the goal hasn’t changed. Microsoft wants to build an interoperable network of AR, VR, and mixed-reality headsets from different manufacturers, all talking to one another and running Windows 10 Universal Apps.</p>\n<p>There are three prongs to this approach: Microsoft’s first-party hardware (HoloLens), the evolving software stack housed within the Windows Mixed Reality platform, and Microsoft’s third-party hardware partnerships with Acer, Asus, Dell, HP, and Lenovo to build $299 mixed-reality headsets running Windows 10. The first of these, the Acer Windows Mixed Reality Development Edition headset, is already shipping to developers.</p>\n<h3><b>WHAT IS MIXED REALITY?</b></h3><p>Microsoft isn’t the only AR company that has started using the term <i>mixed reality</i> to differentiate among points on the AR/VR spectrum. On AR side are the monocular glasses you see from companies such as Vuzix and smartphone-based AR popularized by apps such as Pokemon Go.</p>\n<p>On the other side are the more immersive, binocular, head-mounted experiences (displays in both eyes with a 360-degree field of vision) offered by devices such as the HoloLens, the ODG R-9 glasses, and the still-unseen Magic Leap. In oversimplified terms, you can think of AR as adding overlaid information or virtual objects in more of a two-dimensional way on top of what’s in front of you.</p>\n<p>But the continuum in which these kinds of technologies exist goes deeper than that. A spectrum with the physical world on one side and true virtual reality on the other would look something like this:</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0111-0120/147253-1-eng-US/f0111-012.jpg\" width=\"1310\" height=\"851\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0111-01\" title=\"f0111-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>(Don’t worry too much about “augmented virtuality”; we’re not quite there yet.)</p>\n<p>The industry is mired in confusing terminology at the moment, but separating out the jargon is important not only for understanding the ecosystem but also for identifying the points at which Microsoft plans to plug into it. If the tech giant’s vision comes to pass, its mixed-reality software may run in headsets ranging from $299 to $3,000 and embedded in consumer and enterprise experiences in gaming, e-commerce, industrial design, and manufacturing; interactive enterprise data visualizations; medicine; and beyond.</p>\n<h3><b>HOW YOU BUILD A MIXED-REALITY OS</b></h3><p>During a recent briefing with Microsoft, PCMag got a chance to briefly check out the new Acer partner headset. We also got a breakdown of the Windows Mixed Reality software stack, including some insight into how Microsoft is working with OEMs to build the $299 headsets and what the recent Windows 10 Creators Update for mixed reality Windows apps on a range of different computing devices.</p>\n<p>The Windows Mixed Reality platform breaks down into a number of different layers. At the top of the stack is the head-mounted display (HMD) with six Degrees of Freedom (6DoF), representing the level of 3D motion and position tracking supported. The HoloLens uses what Microsoft calls “inside-out 6DoF,” meaning position tracking that combines data from multiple input sensors and cameras with algorithms to keep the experience smooth. For context, untethered VR headsets that use a smartphone display, including the Samsung Gear VR and Google Daydream View, currently support 3DoF, sometimes known as pitch-yaw-roll. Tethered VR headsets such as Oculus Rift and HTC Vive have 6DoF position tracking.</p>\n<p class=\"pullQuote\"><b>The Windows Mixed Reality platform breaks down into a number of different layers.</b></p>\n<p>The Windows 10 Creators Update includes support for 6DoF motion control in the Acer and other upcoming OEM headsets. The Acer Windows Mixed Reality Development Edition includes two front-facing position tracking cameras and dual displays, compared with the four cameras you’ll find on the more expensive HoloLens (the two added HoloLens cameras are used for spatial mapping), but all five partner headsets will support 6DoF. An update coming later this year will add support for integrated graphics chips in mixed reality headsets, though the hardware will need a relatively recent Intel 7th generation chip to get the update.</p>\n<p>The next layers in the Windows Mixed Reality stack handle input, middleware, and the application programming interfaces (APIs) for mixed reality and spatial perception. The input layer processes all the visual, gyroscopic, voice, and spatial input data that an AR/VR device collects at any given time. This might encompass data from sources including coordination systems, gaze and directionality, gestures, voice input, spatial sound, and spatial mapping.</p>\n<p>The middleware and API layers are key to understanding how the platform is beginning to connect to the rest of the AR/VR software ecosystem. The Windows Mixed Reality developer documentation already includes instructions for building holographic apps using popular platforms including Unity (cross-platform development engine) and Vuforia (open-source AR development platform), and a middleware protocol for building MR apps using the Microsoft DirectX runtime.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0113-0121/147246-1-eng-US/f0113-012.jpg\" width=\"1065\" height=\"613\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0113-01\" title=\"f0113-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>MIXED REALITY</b></p>\n<p><b>This term, used by Microsoft and others, denotes the range of points on the AR/VR spectrum.</b></p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>The platform isn’t open, per se — you’ve got to play by Microsoft’s Universal Windows App rules — but Microsoft is providing a number of options for plugging into its mixed reality software stack. One example of this is Intel’s Project Alloy VR headset, expected later this year, which runs a version of Windows Mixed Reality software.</p>\n<p>The final layers of the stack add a custom user interface Microsoft calls a “shell,” along with cloud services such as Xbox Live authentication and syncing, and collaborative messaging through services like Skype. In the Acer Windows Mixed Reality Development Edition we got a brief look at, the shell was essentially an operating system laid out like rooms in a house.</p>\n<p>The user can then teleport into different rooms and launch various apps displayed as floating icons or occupying a tile on a wall. These can be simple apps such as Photos, Movies and TV, a Microsoft Edge, or even a full-fledged Windows 10 Start menu you could navigate within the experience, which worked with an Xbox controller. Of course there are also some fun 3D interactive modeling capabilities as with HoloLens. Demo examples ranged from elephants and tigers roaming around to a waving astronaut you can place in the room, and an app that launches you into a 3D solar system. These are just a couple examples, considering the OEM headsets can run any Universal Windows App. From a software perspective, Microsoft sees all these devices as Windows 10 computers for your head.</p>\n<p>The company may release a standard mixed reality hardware specification at some point down the road, but at the moment Microsoft is focusing on the software stack and co-engineering the coming wave of partner headsets. If you take a closer look at the Windows 10 Anniversary Release (and the HoloLens Commercial Suite within it), you can also see the software features Microsoft has been adding under the hood to make it’s enterprise-facing HoloLens more attractive for mainstream business deployment.</p>\n<p>The HoloLens Commercial Suite bolsters the base feature set of the HoloLens Development Edition, allowing enterprises to treat the mixed reality headset as just another device in corporate IT networks. Microsoft released the HoloLens Commercial Suite last August for $5,000; for that extra $2K, you get features including deeper mobile device management (MDM) with Microsoft Intune along with Kiosk Mode, which will launch the HoloLens directly into a specific app experience for the purposes of an in-store demo in a retail environment.</p>\n<p>The Commercial Suite also comes with Microsoft BitLocker Drive Encryption and access to virtual private network (VPN) protection, which is now more important than ever. The shiny hardware will always get more attention, particularly as Asus, Dell, HP, and Lenovo roll out their own partner headsets in the coming months. But for the clearest picture of where Microsoft’s mixed reality strategy is headed, keep a close eye on the software.</p>\n<p><b>ROB MARVIN</b></p>\n","layout":{},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":0,"link_source":"","competition":[],"flatplan_title":"","notes":"","gutter_credit":"","other":"","image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1493839974.0117","name":"f0109-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0109-0122/147260-1-eng-US/f0109-012.jpg?t=default_ipad_portrait&ext/f0109-012_default_ipad_portrait.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"768","height":"1024","legacy_id":"12313","is_default":true},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1493839974.0117","name":"f0109-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0109-0122/147260-1-eng-US/f0109-012.jpg?t=default_ipad_landscape&ext/f0109-012_default_ipad_landscape.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"576","height":"768","legacy_id":"12313","is_default":false}],"related_objects":{"image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_2_1493839971.5986","name":"f0113-01","source":"","caption":"<p><b>MIXED REALITY</b></p>\n<p><b>This term, used by Microsoft and others, denotes the range of points on the AR/VR spectrum.</b></p>\n","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0113-0121/147246-1-eng-US/f0113-012.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"1065","height":"613","legacy_id":"12311"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_2_1493839971.5986","name":"f0113-01","source":"","caption":"<p><b>MIXED REALITY</b></p>\n<p><b>This term, used by Microsoft and others, denotes the range of points on the AR/VR spectrum.</b></p>\n","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0113-0121/147246-1-eng-US/f0113-012.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"1065","height":"613","legacy_id":"12311"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_1_1493839972.7561","name":"f0111-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0111-0120/147253-1-eng-US/f0111-012.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"1310","height":"851","legacy_id":"12312"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_1_1493839972.7561","name":"f0111-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0111-0120/147253-1-eng-US/f0111-012.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"1310","height":"851","legacy_id":"12312"}]},"url_alias":"http://pcmagazine-us.audiencemedia.com","type":"story","order":"20","folio_number":"109","folio_numbers":"109,110,111,112,113,114","pdf_page_index":"109","thumbnail":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0109-0122/147260-1-eng-US/f0109-012.jpg?t=tablet_story_thumbnail&ext/f0109-012_tablet_story_thumbnail.jpg","color":"FFFFFF","real_id":"12310","main_section_id":"855","ads":[]},{"id":"zinio_253_100340926_1493839975.7316","title":"YOUR NEXT CUTE ROBOT MAY BE KOREAN","sub_title":"","author":[{"id":"0","name":"SASCHA SEGAN","email":"noreply@audiencemedia.com","is_default":false}],"tag":"","strap_line":"FEATURES","intro":"","body":"<p class=\"byline\"><b>BY SASCHA SEGAN</b></p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0115-0119/147317-1-eng-US/f0115-012.jpg\" width=\"1600\" height=\"2133\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0115-01\" title=\"f0115-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p><b>P</b>ibo and Cubroid are friends. In a country where three giant conglomerates (LG, Samsung, and Hyundai) suck up most of the engineering talent, these two pint-sized little robots could be the future of Korean hardware innovation.</p>\n<p>Pibo is a 3D-printed, Raspberry Pi-based “family companion” that can use the internet to answer questions about your world. Cubroid is a bunch of robotic blocks that help kids learn how to program using physical objects. The two are part of a small club of companies in Korea’s new startup scene, which is dominated by software and services.</p>\n<p>In a presentation, consultant Nathan Millard of G3 Partners says there’s been a massive upswing in the number of Korean startups in the past five years, with more than 20 accelerators, a vibrant investment scene, and major government support. When I visited the startups behind Pibo and Cubroid, I found a new Digital Media City (DMC) by the old World Cup stadium featuring towers stuffed with dozens of small startup companies.</p>\n<p>The biggest challenge, it seems, is global breakout. Of the 46 startups that DMC’s Yu Bae Park told me he helps manage, only about 10 percent are currently looking at markets outside Korea. Millard points out that “of Korea’s recent standout successes ... none have found success beyond Korea.”</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0116-0119/147310-1-eng-US/f0116-012.jpg\" width=\"1310\" height=\"726\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0116-01\" title=\"f0116-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>BESTIE BOTS</b></p>\n<p><b>Pibo, at right, is the third generation of Circulus’s robots.</b></p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>Korean tech firms other than the big three have tended to develop primarily for their own market—Korea has its own analogues of Google (Naver), Facebook/WhatsApp (Kakao), and various other services—and they don’t tend to think or speak globally. That’s changing, too, though. The Pibo and Cubroid guys, while unpolished and thoroughly engineer-driven, have their eyes set on the global market, and even on the U.S.</p>\n<p>One thing about being in a small scene is that everyone knows each other. Cubroid’s Mark Shin showed me a Javascript book written by Pibo’s Jonggun Park, and said he wanted to use Pibo’s big-data AI system in the future. That’s the kind of cross-pollination a startup scene could use to succeed.</p>\n<p class=\"pullQuote\"><b>The Pibo and Cubroid guys, while unpolished and thoroughly engineer-driven, have their eyes set on the global market.</b></p>\n<h3><b>BIG DATA, SMALL ROBOT</b></h3><p>Pibo is clearly one of DMC’s darlings. It’s made by Circulus, which is led by Jonggun Park, a former Samsung engineer who was working on IoT and big data projects when he became convinced that the way to push Korea forward was to teach everyone to code.</p>\n<p>“I think that if everyone could make their own programs in Korea, then our country will be stronger,” he said.</p>\n<p>Coding eventually became robots because, well, “most guys love robots.” Coding robots thus became Pibo: an open-source, Raspberry Pi-based, 3D-printed home robot with its own cloud-based system, where you can code it through a block language, use JavaScript or download features that other people have written.</p>\n<p>“We will provide our own functions for families, but everyone can add their own ideas for programming, share their ideas, and download other peoples’ ideas too,” Park said.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0118-0123/147303-1-eng-US/f0118-012.jpg\" width=\"1084\" height=\"525\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0118-01\" title=\"f0118-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>FRIENDLY AI</b></p>\n<p><b>Pibo is presented as a companion robot. From the company’s website (verbatim): “Hi? I am piBo as your companion! How about share your life with me?”</b></p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>Pibo’s demo reel shows the little bot being a home and family companion. Pibo plays soothing music, asks about your emotions, and takes notes to relay to other family members. It has personality. The coolest thing about Pibo isn’t the hardware. It’s the AI platform. Remember, Park started out as an AI engineer.</p>\n<p>Pibo’s platform scrapes Google and the Korean services Naver and Kakao, and mixes in news sources like the New York Times and BBC News, trying to fit queries to web data the way Google Assistant does. The company also plans to integrate the Alexa API and let Pibo use Alexa skills. So when I asked Pibo what she thinks of Donald Trump, she gave a consensus based on the contents of Korean blogs. (They don’t much like her.)</p>\n<p>Google Home and Alexa are trying to do this as well, of course, but the extra twist for Pibo is that she’s mobile. She’s not very mobile—she’s slow, and only has about two hours of battery life when she’s on the move. But she can amble around a table using her camera to do video calls with various people sitting there, for instance.</p>\n<p>Pibo’s heart is a Raspberry Pi 2. Park said they’d like to use a Pi 3 or Pi 4, but the 2 is the right price to keep the robot under $500. “I want an intelligent robot for everyone, so we focused our price,” he said.</p>\n<p>The idea here is to let everyone do the level of DIYing they want. Are you hardcore? Circulus has uploaded the whole thing to Thingiverse, a repository of 3D printing codes. Just want a cuddly home companion? It’ll cost under $500 when it goes on Kickstarter in September.</p>\n<h3><b>TOTALLY CUBULAR</b></h3><p>You know those guys who can sort of do everything? Mark Jaekwang Shin (below, right) is one of those guys. He’s a lawyer. He programs. He has an MBA. But right now he’s living off some money his brother-in-law lent him and funding from various Korean seed funds and prizes, in a cluttered little office at the top of a slightly run-down building halfway to the Seoul airport, miles from the DMC startup hub.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0119-0121/147296-1-eng-US/f0119-012.jpg\" width=\"1312\" height=\"885\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0119-01\" title=\"f0119-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>Shin has three daughters, ages 11, 8, and 5, and he wants them all to code. So he came up with a set of configurable Lego-like blocks that can be programmed either with a smartphone app (because it’s impossible to get the kids off their phones, he says), or with the popular educational language MIT Scratch.</p>\n<p>“The future of education is very interesting to me,” he said. “I wanted to get [my 11-year-old] to code, using something like a robot.” (Me too.)</p>\n<p>The Scratch connection is what drew me to Cubroid, because my daughter is into Scratch. It’s not just a language, it’s also an unusually positive, reinforcing and safe online community for kids: Club Penguin for li’l coders.</p>\n<p>Cubroid’s office is a mess of boxes of little Lego-like cubes, naked circuit boards, and one set of shelves with every other educational robot they could think of, for inspiration.</p>\n<p>The Cubroid blocks, two years in the making, snap together just like Lego. A prototype first generation used magnets, but a snap-together toy is safer, Shin said.</p>\n<p>There are 10 different cubes: a knob; proximity, light and touch sensors; two motors; an LED light grid; a buzzer, a “master” cube and dummy spacer cubes. Each functional block has its own little battery, which charges via MicroUSB. They’re color-coded by function: green and red for functions, blue for the master cube, and orange for spacers. The master cube communicates with a smartphone via Bluetooth or a PC via USB, and then communicates with sub-cubes using a proprietary wireless protocol Cubroid developed. You can also plug the master cube into a PC using micro-USB.</p>\n<p>Shin and his two staffers quickly put together a wobbly little robot with an LED smiley face which tried to clomp across the floor, and another giant kaiju-like thing that ended up being so heavy, he needed to replace the motor blocks with a newer version that had more torque.</p>\n<p>The idea here is to balance simplicity and extensibility. Lego Mindstorms lets you build and program with Scratch, but it’s very fiddly. Other robots like Dash and Dot, Anki Cozmo and Ozobot are easier to use, but are fixed hardware. Cubroid is extensible, but extremely easy to put together.</p>\n<p>On a white board, they’ve scribbled ideas for the next round of cubes: a camera, an MP3 player, an OLED screen. Shin said they’re developing an Amazon Alexa-compatible block and a face-recognition block, and they’re talking to the Pibo folks about connecting to Pibo’s cloud-based system. “In the future, like LittleBits, there could be different kits,” he said.</p>\n<p>Cubroid’s next step is to go to the big-league Kickstarter for manufacturing cash, probably sometime this fall. I’m normally super skeptical about Kickstarter, but I know this isn’t vaporware and these guys are for real. They just can, right now, only afford to make lots of 300 at a time.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0121-0118/147289-1-eng-US/f0121-012.jpg\" width=\"1140\" height=\"650\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0121-01\" title=\"f0121-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>CUBROID BLOCKS</b></p>\n<p><b>This modular system lets you build robots similar to the way you’d put together a LittleBits creation.</b></p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>“When the Kickstarter money comes, we can make more,” he said.</p>\n<p>And they don’t seem to be having manufacturing problems. Both Pibo and Cubroid show the advantage of starting a new hardware company in a country that actually, you know, builds hardware. There’s a certain US Kickstarter narrative that I call “Heart of Darkness,” involving US hardware companies that basically get eaten by a predatory China supply chain. Shin’s building his robots in Korea. He’s Korean. He speaks Korean. This could work. I hope it does. Then we in the US might be hearing more about Korean tech than just LG, Samsung, and Hyundai.</p>\n","layout":{},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":0,"link_source":"","competition":[],"flatplan_title":"","notes":"","gutter_credit":"","other":"","image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1493839980.1463","name":"f0115-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0115-0119/147317-1-eng-US/f0115-012.jpg?t=default_ipad_portrait&ext/f0115-012_default_ipad_portrait.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"768","height":"1024","legacy_id":"12320","is_default":true},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1493839980.1463","name":"f0115-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0115-0119/147317-1-eng-US/f0115-012.jpg?t=default_ipad_landscape&ext/f0115-012_default_ipad_landscape.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"576","height":"768","legacy_id":"12320","is_default":false}],"related_objects":{"image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_4_1493839975.8396","name":"f0121-01","source":"","caption":"<p><b>CUBROID BLOCKS</b></p>\n<p><b>This modular system lets you build robots similar to the way you’d put together a LittleBits creation.</b></p>\n","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0121-0118/147289-1-eng-US/f0121-012.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"1140","height":"650","legacy_id":"12316"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_4_1493839975.8396","name":"f0121-01","source":"","caption":"<p><b>CUBROID BLOCKS</b></p>\n<p><b>This modular system lets you build robots similar to the way you’d put together a LittleBits creation.</b></p>\n","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0121-0118/147289-1-eng-US/f0121-012.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"1140","height":"650","legacy_id":"12316"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_3_1493839977.0408","name":"f0119-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0119-0121/147296-1-eng-US/f0119-012.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"1312","height":"885","legacy_id":"12317"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_3_1493839977.0408","name":"f0119-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0119-0121/147296-1-eng-US/f0119-012.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"1312","height":"885","legacy_id":"12317"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_2_1493839978.0621","name":"f0118-01","source":"","caption":"<p><b>FRIENDLY AI</b></p>\n<p><b>Pibo is presented as a companion robot.
