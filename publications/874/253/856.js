Anyone who has had to replace a phone unexpectedly because it was lost, stolen, or damaged knows how important it is to have a backup of their contacts list. And we all have that friend who’s posted on social media, “I lost my phone. Text me on this number and tell me who you are.”</p>\n<p>Like most people, my contacts are all over the place. I work to keep family and friends’ information up to date in Apple Contacts. The email addresses of most my work associates are in my business email account. My personal Gmail and other personal email accounts have a smattering of useful information in their associated contacts lists, but they’re also littered with auto-saved information, including every organization to which I’ve ever emailed a support@ message.</p>\n<p>Many companies have tried to solve the problem of having scattered contacts saved across different databases. I’ve tried plenty of solutions, and the sad truth is I haven’t found one with every feature I want in a centralized address book.</p>\n<h3><b>BUILD YOUR OWN</b></h3><p>A few years back, I experimented with ad-hoc methods of generating custom contacts lists, mostly by using IFTTT. This project wasn’t a complete failure, but it ended up generating spreadsheets, which aren’t all that user friendly or fun to search from a mobile device.</p>\n<p>For those who like to have a lot of control, however, building your own contacts list may be the way to go. Just be sure to back it up and save it someplace that’s accessible to you from a mobile device so you can make phone calls and pull up people’s addresses when you’re at the post office mailing gifts (my two most important use cases, aside from email).</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0123-0120/147360-1-eng-US/f0123-012.jpg\" width=\"1310\" height=\"729\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0123-01\" title=\"f0123-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>THIRD-PARTY CONTACT OPTIONS</b></h3><p>A number of mobile apps do a decent job of merging and syncing contact information from many sources. FullContact (Android, iOS, web) is pretty good. You connect it to email accounts and other online services that have contacts lists associated with them, and it merges multiple databases into one. But then it does something different: FullContact scours the web for up-to-date information on those same contacts.</p>\n<p>When I started writing this article, I hadn’t used FullContact in a while, so I ran my contacts through its magical process. At first, I was shocked to learn that a fairly high-level editor I knew was now apparently also president of an organization that dabbled in advertising! What a sellout, I thought. But they I went digging online for more information and it turns out it was someone else with the same name. Unfortunately, FullContact hadn’t given me enough context to realize I was dealing with the wrong guy, which is a problem you also might run into with this app.</p>\n<p class=\"pullQuote\"><b>Cloze connects with social media accounts, giving you more insight into what your contacts are doing.</b></p>\n<p>Cloze (Android, iOS, web) is another app I’ve turned to now and then, although it’s become more of a customer-relationship app than a contacts management app. Like FullContact, Cloze starts by asking you to connect various accounts, and then it pulls together everything you have.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0124-0119/147353-1-eng-US/f0124-012.jpg\" width=\"553\" height=\"553\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0124-01\" title=\"f0124-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>Its signature feature, however, is that Cloze connects with social media accounts too, giving you more insight into what your contacts are doing, not just how to get in touch with them. In analyzing not just your contacts but the interaction you have with them and frequency of those interactions, Cloze identifies people who should be most important to you, at least from a getting-ahead perspective.</p>\n<p>A big problem with both Cloze and FullContact is that you get only so much out of them before you have to pay a hefty subscription fee—$159 and $99 per year, respectively.</p>\n<h3><b>TWO FREE STAPLES</b></h3><p>As I continued my search for a way to merge, organize, and back up my contacts list, I found myself returning to two staples: Google Contacts and Apple Contacts. Both store their data in the cloud, and both are easy to restore on an iPhone or Android phone. They’re free, and they both have tools for pulling in information from other sources and de-duping your list. Unfortunately, the de-duping feature is a huge disappointment with both apps.</p>\n<p class=\"pullQuote\"><b>I found myself returning to two staples: Google Contacts and Apple Contacts.</b></p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0125-0120/147346-1-eng-US/f0125-012.jpg\" width=\"748\" height=\"696\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0125-01\" title=\"f0125-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>Google Contacts was recently updated to have a different look and some new features, but it was a little light on the number of services it could connect with to import contacts automatically. And to import contacts manually, you have to switch back to the old version of the app, as the new one can’t do it yet.</p>\n<p>Apple Contacts, in the end, has become my top choice. It connects to many more services than I had realized, including AOL, Facebook, Google, LinkedIn, Microsoft Exchange, Yahoo, and any service that can generate a CardDAV or LDAP file.</p>\n<p>I’m sure this solution is a disappointment to Android users, and that’s not lost on me. I have an Android device and am still trying to decide on the best method for making my iCloud contacts accessible there. Another problem is that, as mentioned, the de-duping feature is terrible and missed dozens of entries that should have been merged in my testing. I ended up spending an hour scrolling through my contacts list to clean it up.</p>\n<p class=\"pullQuote\"><b>Ideally, I want one list of contacts built by merging contacts apps and databases that I already keep.</b></p>\n<h3><b>WHAT’S THE BEST CONTACTS APP?</b></h3><p>In an ideal world, I want one list of contacts built by merging other contacts apps and databases that I already keep (Gmail, Facebook, Apple Contacts, Outlook, and so on). And I absolutely want the ability to access that list from any device, which means the data must be saved in the cloud.</p>\n<p>I also want the ability to tell the app to disregard or hide contact cards, en masse, that are missing key information that I choose: For example, if I have an email address saved as a contact but no name or other information attached to it, get rid of it!</p>\n<p>It would also be helpful if people could and would update their information on file from time to time. While some companies have tried to build this feature into their apps, it never pans out, for a number of reasons. So for now, the best method of keeping an address book up to date is to merge several sources into one and save it to the cloud.</p>\n","layout":{},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":0,"link_source":"","competition":[],"flatplan_title":"","notes":"","gutter_credit":"","other":"","image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1493839985.3075","name":"f0122-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0122-0120/147367-1-eng-US/f0122-012.jpg?t=default_ipad_portrait&ext/f0122-012_default_ipad_portrait.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"768","height":"465","legacy_id":"12326","is_default":true},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1493839985.3075","name":"f0122-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0122-0120/147367-1-eng-US/f0122-012.jpg?t=default_ipad_landscape&ext/f0122-012_default_ipad_landscape.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"1024","height":"620","legacy_id":"12326","is_default":false}],"related_objects":{"image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_3_1493839982.2377","name":"f0125-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0125-0120/147346-1-eng-US/f0125-012.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"748","height":"696","legacy_id":"12323"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_3_1493839982.2377","name":"f0125-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0125-0120/147346-1-eng-US/f0125-012.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"748","height":"696","legacy_id":"12323"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_2_1493839983.2699","name":"f0124-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0124-0119/147353-1-eng-US/f0124-012.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"553","height":"553","legacy_id":"12324"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_2_1493839983.2699","name":"f0124-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0124-0119/147353-1-eng-US/f0124-012.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"553","height":"553","legacy_id":"12324"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_1_1493839984.1622","name":"f0123-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0123-0120/147360-1-eng-US/f0123-012.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"1310","height":"729","legacy_id":"12325"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_1_1493839984.1622","name":"f0123-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0123-0120/147360-1-eng-US/f0123-012.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"1310","height":"729","legacy_id":"12325"}]},"url_alias":"http://pcmagazine-us.audiencemedia.com","type":"story","order":"22","folio_number":"122","folio_numbers":"122,123,124,125,126","pdf_page_index":"122","thumbnail":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0122-0120/147367-1-eng-US/f0122-012.jpg?t=tablet_story_thumbnail&ext/f0122-012_tablet_story_thumbnail.jpg","color":"FFFFFF","real_id":"12322","main_section_id":"856","ads":[]},{"id":"zinio_253_100340926_1493839986.8687","title":"Run a Security Checkup on Your Google Account","sub_title":"","author":[{"id":"0","name":"LANCE WHITNEY","email":"noreply@audiencemedia.com","is_default":false}],"tag":"","strap_line":"TIPS & HOW TOS / HOW TO","intro":"","body":"<p class=\"byline\"><b>BY LANCE WHITNEY</b></p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0127-0120/147424-1-eng-US/f0127-012.jpg\" width=\"1600\" height=\"977\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0127-01\" title=\"f0127-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p><b>I</b>f you’re like a lot of people, your online life is heavily tied to Google, from search and Gmail to Google Calendar and YouTube.

in your gadgets: The smudges and crumbs you can see and the creepy-crawly bacteria that you can’t. Studies show that infection-causing E coli and Staphylococcus aureus, fecal matter (yep), and just plain dirt are hanging out on your tech.</p>\n<p>This information might make you want to dunk everything into a vat of bleach, but that wouldn’t be the best thing for you or your devices. Instead, grab some microfiber cloths, Q-tips, distilled water, isopropyl alcohol, and dish soap, and read our guide to getting your gadgets to gleam.</p>\n<p>Note: Before you clean anything, unplug it or turn it off.</p>\n<h3><b>SMARTPHONE AND TABLET</b></h3><p>Protest if you will, but you’ve probably used your smartphone or tablet in less-than-sanitary places (we are talking about the bathroom). You wash your hands, but then you pick up your phone or tablet—and all the germs that have now attached themselves to it. It’s a gross fact that phones tend to have 10 times the bacteria that toilet seats do.</p>\n<p>To scrub a phone or tablet that does not have a screen protector, you have to take extra care, since it might have an oleophobic (fingerprint-resistant) coating that could come off. The gentlest way to clean it is to take distilled water and a microfiber cloth to wipe down the phone. Use Q-tips to clean around crevices.</p>\n<p>If your device has a screen protector—tempered glass or just thin plastic—get some isopropyl alcohol, distilled water, a spray bottle, and a microfiber cloth. Pour one part alcohol and one part water into the spray bottle, and then spritz a lint-free cloth with the solution, and wipe down the phone.</p>\n<p>To keep your phone or tablet clean on a regular basis, keep some wipes (such as Wireless Wipes) handy, and swab it down daily. If you want to be fancy, then carry Well-Kept Screen-Cleansing Towelettes with you and use those. They come in small patterned packages that fit neatly into pants pockets or purses.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0136-0116/147566-1-eng-US/f0136-012.jpg\" width=\"1285\" height=\"730\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0136-01\" title=\"f0136-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>GERM FACTORY</b></p>\n<p><b>Most people won’t admit it, but lots of them take their mobile devices into less-than-sanitary places. Keep the bacteria count down frequent, careul cleaning.</b></p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>LAPTOP</b></h3><p>Because your laptop travels, it has plenty of opportunity to pick up unsavory hitchhikers. Turn it upside down and (gently) shake out the keyboard to rid your laptop of the biggest and most obvious invaders: dirt and crumbs. Then grab a can of compressed air duster and blast it.</p>\n<p>Next, make sure your laptop is not only unplugged but that the battery is removed. Lightly dampen a microfiber cleaning cloth and go over all the plastic or metal surfaces.</p>\n<p>To clean an LCD screen, use a product made for the job, such as EcoMoist Natural Screen Cleaner, along with a lint-free cloth to prevent those streaks that other cleaners can leave. For touch screens, use water or eyeglass cleaner.</p>\n<h3><b>DESKTOP</b></h3><p>Your computer monitor might be your window to the world, but it’s not an actual window—so no Windex. Instead, use a soft cloth dampened with distilled water or the same display cleaner you’d use on a laptop for an LCD screen. Clean a touch screen with a lint-free cloth; if there are smudges, use only water or eyeglass cleaner to remove them.</p>\n<p>As for the plastic parts that surround the screen, go ahead and spritz some window cleaner on them, or just use water. The same goes for your tower: Go over all the surfaces with a cloth and either water, general-purpose cleaner, or a mix that’s half isopropyl alcohol and half water.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0137-0118/147559-1-eng-US/f0137-012.jpg\" width=\"1285\" height=\"730\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0137-01\" title=\"f0137-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>CLEAN SCREEN</b></p>\n<p><b>To clean a laptop LCD, be sure to use a product made for the job, along with a lint-free cloth.</b></p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>Chances are you’ve picked up the nasty habit of eating over your keyboard, and in turn, your keyboard has picked up some crumbs. Shake your keyboard out over a trash can and then grab a can of compressed air and get rid of the ones that lurk under the keys. Then get a damp cloth and go over the keys. Use a Q-tip to get inside the crevices. If your keyboard is particularly dirty, mix up a solution of one part isopropyl alcohol to one part water and use it with the cloth and Q-tips.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0138-0114/147552-1-eng-US/f0138-012.jpg\" width=\"1310\" height=\"663\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0138-01\" title=\"f0138-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>CRUMBY SNACKS</b></p>\n<p><b>Do you eat while you work or surf?

Use the same half-alcohol, half-water solution on a Q-tip, and run it over the feet of the mouse and through any cracks and crevices. Then take a cloth dipped in the solution and go over the body of the mouse. Don’t skip the cord.</p>\n<h3><b>FITNESS TRACKERS AND SMARTWATCHES</b></h3><p>Your fitness tracker—and maybe your smartwatch—is there to make you sweat, but that means it gets sweaty along with you. The good news is that both can stand up to light moisture. Clean the face with a bit of water and a lint-free cloth.</p>\n<p>Before you clean any band, remove it from your tracker or watch. For bands made of rubber (silicone, elastomer, and the like), rinse them with water or wipe them down with a small amount of rubbing alcohol. When you’re wearing moisturizing or sunscreen lotion with your band, then use a gentle skin cleanser like Cetaphil on it. If marks remain, try removing them with a rubber eraser.</p>\n<p class=\"pullQuote\"><b>Your computer monitor might be your window to the world, but it’s not an actual window—so no Windex.</b></p>\n<p>Should that fail, mix one part baking soda to one part water to make a paste, and then rub that into the band and wipe off with a wet cloth. And if the band is still stained, you can try a Mr. Clean Magic Eraser. But be warned: The “magic” in the Magic Eraser is that it removes layers of the substance you’re cleaning, so essentially, you’re sandpapering the band.</p>\n<p>Metal bands should be wiped with a lint-free cloth, and if necessary, you can involve a small bit of water. If you have a stainless-steel band that’s become discolored, use a tiny bit of a stainless-steel polish, but make sure to thoroughly rinse it off so you don’t transfer the chemicals to your skin when you put the band back on. For discolored silver-plated bands, use a silver-cleaning cloth sparingly (plating flakes off easily).</p>\n<p>Leather bands can be wiped down with water and a lint-free cloth. The same goes for nylon bands, but those can smell, because they are especially prone to picking up sweat. If this happens or if the band is stained, mix a tiny amount of dish detergent and water to wipe it down, then follow with plain water.</p>\n<p>Fitbit recommends cleaning the charging contacts on its line of trackers with a toothpick or a toothbrush dipped in rubbing alcohol.
