    </div><p>For me, when AI [artificial intelligence] is sufficient and able to think for itself, then yes, it will deserve rights. We have human beings walking around with artificial or transplanted organs and that number will only grow as our medical knowledge grows. Will these people be considered less than human?</p>

<p>A sufficiently advanced AI should have just as many rights as a human. The brain is essentially just an advanced biological computer. There is nothing magical that separates us from a theoretical conscious machine; we’re not more special just because we’re made of flesh. The brain is just as much a machine as any. The fear and ignorance in this comment section is exactly what holds back humanity. I’d rather talk to an artificial intelligence than the majority of humans, the idiots that they are.</p>

<p>My dog is more intelligent than most of the people I deal with on a daily basis, and I’m a college professor. So maybe we should be asking the inverse question.</p>

<h3><b>Q: HOW DO I GET RID OF THE “PICK UP WHERE YOU LEFT OFF?” PROMPT IN MICROSOFT WORD?</b></h3><p>A: When you reopen a document in modern versions of Microsoft Word, it displays an offer to “Pick up where you left off,” as if Word were an e-reader of some kind. I tend to open a document and then immediately hit some keys—perhaps Alt+W, E to view in draft mode, or Ctrl+F to find something. These commands are ignored because of the “Pick up...” offer. It’s seriously annoying. And I finally figured out how to kill it!</p>
<p>Launch REGEDIT and navigate to the key HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Office\16.0\Word\Reading Locations. Delete every single subkey; each of them is the where-you-left-off information for a different document.</p>
<p>Now right-click the Reading Locations key and choose Permissions. Click the button labeled Advanced. Near the bottom of the resulting window you’ll find a button labeled Disable inheritance. Click that, and click OK repeatedly. You’ve ensured that Word can’t create any more of those remembered pick-up points.</p>
<p>If at some point you want to re-enable that feature, just follow the same instructions, but click the Enable inheritance button.</p>
