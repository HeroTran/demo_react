    </div><p><b>E</b>lon Musk has had another bright idea. Nobody can accuse Mr. Musk of a lack of intellectual diversity in his pursuits, which have ranged from glitzy solar roof tiles to cartoonishly fast cars, colonizing other planets, and domestic energy infrastructure. He’s someone who thinks in the future tense. And he clearly believes that AI is the future.</p>
<p>As AI advances, humans will have to find a comfortable coexistence with machines that learn or risk winding up as “house cats” to intelligence beyond ours. Toward that goal, and with a happy side effect of therapeutic benefits for certain brain disorders, Elon Musk has been funding a company called Neuralink that wants to implant an AI interface in your brain.</p>
<p>The company is currently working with syringe-injectable, flexible, sub-micron-thickness substrates (note the regular grid in the ribbon pictured below) that can function as a component of implantable electronics. The mesh is so gossamer-soft that it doesn’t irritate the brain’s impossibly delicate cellular matrix, and its electrical properties mean that only the target part of the brain receives the electrical stimulus. With recent developments in flexible electronics and bio-inert materials, implantable brain-computer interfaces are coming closer and closer to reality every day.</p>
<p>It has to be stressed here that brain implants are not a casual undertaking. The people who resort to implanted electrodes and the like are people who have no other options. They suffer from degenerative brain diseases, have intractable problems that they can’t solve by any means other than creating a hole in their braincase that incidentally gives the outside microbiome direct access to the brain. Just what you wanted: a hole in your head that only the most intrepid bacteria can get through. Those brain-eating amoeba are going to think these implants are so cool.</p>

    </div><p>Neuralink has been registered in California as a medical research company as of last July, although to date it’s had no public presence whatsoever. The injectable implants are its platform, and it’s working on therapeutic applications for people with brain diseases. But the implants aren’t just limited to treating problems. At last year’s Vox Media Code Conference, Musk talked about his ideas for the company’s future in AI-enabled brain-computer interfaces. It’s critically important to him that machine intelligence remains under our control and aligned with our goals, and to assure that outcome, Musk wants to implant an AI “layer” in people’s brains. “If we can create a high-bandwidth neural interface with your digital self, then you’re no longer a house cat,” he said.</p>
<p>Neuralink isn’t starting from scratch in this endeavor — it’ll start with established brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). We have already advanced technology to the point that we can remotely control the motion of rats, allow locked-in ALS patients a “voice” (in early trials), pilot brain-controlled prostheses, and wire up prosthetic lower limbs that can be controlled directly by the brain as well. All of these technologies are, at best, in the early stages of commercialization and research, but Neuralink hopes to move beyond them in a matter of years. Musk told Vanity Fair that we “are already cyborgs” and that he believes a meaningful brain interface is just 4 to 5 years away.</p>
<p>Am I the only one who has a distinct vision of a solar-shingled Wisteria Lane lookalike cyborg housing development on Mars? There would be battery-electric Tesla cars you can drive around on the Martian surface using only your mind, and remotes to control your upgraded spouse à la The Stepford Wives. You’d upgrade your cognitive AI interface firmware on Patch Tuesday only to find that there’s a bug in the code that bricks your kids. These modern times.</p>
