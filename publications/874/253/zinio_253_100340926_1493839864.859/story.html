    </div><p><b>M</b>icrosoft’s Minecraft game is getting a new marketplace and its own currency. With the launch of the Minecraft Marketplace, businesses will—for the first time—be able to sell their original content to players within the game. Arriving this spring, the Marketplace will be packed with “amazing adventure maps, texture packs, minigames,” and other goodies available for purchase, all accessible across devices via Xbox Live.</p>
<p>“Unlock new avatar skins, change your world or explore incredible new maps from a community with unlimited imagination,” Microsoft said in a statement. The software giant is already working with several businesses to populate Marketplace but said anyone with a registered business can apply.</p>
<p>“The idea is to give Minecraft creators another way to make a living from the game, allowing them to support themselves in the creation of ever-greater projects, while giving Pocket and Windows 10 players access to a growing catalogue of fun stuff — curated and supplied by us, safely and simply,” Microsoft wrote. “And, of course, you can still manually download free community creations you’ve found out there on the internet, too.”</p>
<p>The new in-game currency is called Minecraft Coins. You purchase it inside the game store with real money and use it to buy content in the Marketplace. “You won’t see any creator content in the beta, but we’ll add that when we launch later in Spring,” the company wrote.</p>
