    </div><p><b>F</b>or years, I’ve wanted a portable device as powerful as my PC that I could attach to a monitor or TV while on the go, for easy access to productivity tools. Companies such as Motorola and Asus have developed products that use a smartphone as the core CPU tethered to a laptop shell, but none really took off. And if a recent patent is any indication, Apple also has at least a passing interest in the concept.</p>
<p>But a new product introduced by Samsung is one of the best solutions I have seen to date. The DeX is a dock that allows the new Galaxy S8 or S8+ smartphones serve as a PC CPU. The DeX has multiple ports for linking to a TV, monitor, printer, or other USB-supported device, and Bluetooth support.</p>
<p>In this scenario, you just pop your S8 or S8+ into the DeX cradle for the full PC experience. The OS is Android with a UI modified for the big screen.</p>
<p>What makes this more feasible than something like Motorola’s Atrix concept from 2011 is the growing power of today’s mobile processors. Of course, a PC processor can still deliver a better computing experience, but smartphone and tablet processors can now handle a number of everyday productivity tasks. The DeX simply takes that power and puts it on a bigger screen.</p>
<h3><b>@Bajarin</b></h3><p>I believe the DeX has some interesting potential. In fact, I think it might strike a nerve with many mobile workers whose smartphone is at the center of their business and personal lives today.</p>
<p>I know this concept is a bit radical, and may not have enough power to deliver the desktop-like experience many people need. But when it comes to extending the role of a smartphone in the lives of mobile business users, DeX is an intriguing alternative to lugging around heavy gadgets.</p>
