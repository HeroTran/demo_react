    </div><p><b>L</b>eading up to its announcement, GoPro did a fantastic job creating buzz and anticipation for its first drone, the Karma ($799.99 on its own, $1,099.99 with a Hero5 Black action camera). When it was unveiled last year, no other drone on the market had such a svelte form factor. But the wind was quickly taken out of the Karma’s sails by the comparatively tiny and more capable DJI Mavic Pro, and its rollout was marred by a recall due to a faulty battery latch design. After months of delays, the Karma is finally finished and on sale. But time has not been kind, and there are better drones out there.</p>
<h3><b>DESIGN</b></h3><p>The Karma features a folding design, with arms and landing gear that tuck into the body for storage and transport, and a nose-mounted gimbal. It measures 4.6 by 16.2 by 12.0 inches (HWD) when ready to fly and 3.5 by 8.8 by 14.4 inches when folded for transport. It weighs 2.2 pounds, so you will have to register with the FAA before flying. It’s smaller than a DJI Phantom drone, but not anywhere near as svelte as DJI’s compact Mavic Pro. The tiny foldable Mavic measures 3.3 by 3.3 by 7.8 inches when folded and weighs about 1.6 pounds.</p>
<p>The Karma’s propellers must be screwed on before each flight and removed to fit in its case. This takes only a minute or so, so it’s not a big deal, but it’s not as convenient as the Mavic Pro, which has always-on, folding propellers, or the DJI Phantom 4, which boasts more modern twist-and-lock props.</p>
<p>A backpack is included to transport the drone. It holds the Karma and all of its accessories with ease, and can be strapped to your back or carried like a briefcase. This includes the grip for handheld gimbal use, the remote control, the six included propellers, and the battery charger. GoPro claims the pack is comfortable to wear while biking or other outdoor activities, but it’s a little bulky for that, and it doesn’t hang as comfortably on my body as the ThinkTank Urban Approach backpack I like to wear when hiking with photo gear.</p>

<p><b>CASE IN POINT The included case holds the Karma and all of its accessories, but I didn’t find it to be very comfortable to wear.</b></p>

    </div><p><b>GoPro Karma</b></p>
<p><b>PROS Works with Hero4 and Hero5 cameras. Includes handheld grip for gimbal. Solid tutorial for beginning pilots. Remote has integrated display. Some automated flight features. Easy offline map downloads. Includes backpack.</b></p>
<p><b>CONS Short 15-minute flight time. Very limited suburban operating range. GoPro camera not ideal for aerial work. Remote screen is prone to glare. Omits obstacle avoidance and follow mode.</b></p>
<p>The stabilizing gimbal is mounted at the nose. It’s removable, so you can opt to use it handheld with the included Karma Grip. The Grip, which costs $299.99 when bought separately, is a handheld pistol-style grip for your GoPro. It has its own internal battery and keeps your camera straight and level, even when walking. Think of it like a handheld Steadicam.</p>
<p class="pullQuote"><b>The Karma features a folding design, with arms and landing gear that tuck into the body for storage and transport.</b></p>
<p>The remote control features a clamshell design. When opened, it shows a glossy 5-inch LCD with 720p resolution and a 900cd/m2 brightness rating. On paper, that’s pretty bright, but the high-gloss finish is very prone to glare. In practice, I had a much easier time viewing an iPhone 6 Plus display at full brightness when compared with the Karma remote at its maximum setting under identical conditions. GoPro would have been better off using a matte finish to improve screen visibility.</p>
<p>The face of the remote features two control sticks, and Power, Return-to-Home, and Start/Stop buttons. There’s also a speaker, as the remote gives audio cues in addition to visual information on its screen. The top left side hosts a wheel that tilts the gimbal up and down, and the right includes Mode and Record buttons. I found it very comfortable to hold.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the LED that backs the power button is almost too bright. It’s not a big deal when you’re flying, but if you’re sitting at home setting up the remote, it’s likely to bother your eyes.</p>
<h3><b>FLIGHT EXPERIENCE</b></h3><p>There are a few things you’ll need to do before flying the Karma for the first time. The first is create a free GoPro account. You can do this using the remote control, simply by connecting it to your home network and walking through a few steps.</p>
<p>Once that’s done, the remote prompts you to fly some practice routes in a virtual environment. The flight simulator guides you through the Karma’s basic operation and is a big plus for first-time drone pilots. The tutorial lets you know how the controls work—the left stick adjusts altitude and yaws the Karma left and right, while the right moves it forward, left, right, and back in space.</p>
<p>Here’s something else you’ll want to do from your armchair—download some maps. The Karma remote doesn’t have its own LTE connection, so it can’t access Google Maps data. When you know you’re going to fly in a specific area, you can download a map complete with road names and satellite imagery. You can search for maps by name or ZIP code, and each map requires about two minutes to download.</p>
<h3><b>PERFORMANCE</b></h3><p>The Karma is a perfectly capable aircraft. It locks onto a GPS signal quickly and is very stable in the air. The drone’s top speed is limited—GoPro rates it at 35mph, but I found that cruising speed was closer to 20mph in my test flights. There’s an adjustable geofence to prevent the Karma from straying too far from its launch point.</p>
<p>Operating range is an issue, though. In a standard suburban setting, the video feed started to degrade at just a 700-foot distance. At 900 feet, the control signal was lost, and the drone entered its return-to-home mode. It turns around, putting its nose toward the launch point, and makes a beeline to home base. If something terrible happens and the signal isn’t reacquired, it will land, but chances are the drone and remote will start talking to each other well before that happens.</p>

<p><b>DRONE ON</b></p>
<p><b>The Karma features a four-rotor design and includes some automated features, but doesn’t have a Follow Me mode.</b></p>
</figcaption>
    
    
    
    </div><p>In a rural setting free from home Wi-Fi networks clogging the airwaves, operating range is much better. I had no issues taking the Karma out to 3,000 feet, just within the limits of its default geofence.</p>
<p>Battery life is poor compared with competing models. The Karma gives you a 17-minute estimate of battery life when you take off, but that’s with minimal maneuvering and altitude changes. In real life, I netted about 15 minutes of flying time on average—eight minutes less than the DJI Mavic Pro. Even if you try to stretch that, the drone automatically returns to home when its battery gets low, and it lands in place when it gets down to about a minute of life. An additional battery is $99.99.</p>
<p>The Karma has a few automated flight modes. To access them, you need to turn off the default Easy operation mode, which you should do only when you’re comfortable behind the controls. You can set up perfectly circular, automated orbits, move from point to point in Cable Cam mode, or start with the camera honed in on your person and pull up and away to reveal the landscape around you in what GoPro calls a Dronie.</p>
<p>The automated flight mode that’s conspicuously absent is Follow. It’s a mode you’d think the GoPro crowd would demand—the ability for your drone to track your movements while it’s performing some insane stunt. The lack of obstacle detection and avoidance probably went into the decision-making process to omit this popular feature from the Karma. The DJI Mavic Pro, on the other hand, can actually identify and track a subject automatically, and has an obstacle avoidance system to help prevent it from crashing when tracking.</p>

    </div><h3><b>VIDEO QUALITY</b></h3><p>We reviewed the Karma with GoPro’s latest flagship camera, the Hero5 Black. It shoots in 4K at frame rates up to 30fps and with an ultra-wide field of view only. If you opt for less resolution, you have options for a tighter field of view and faster frame rates.</p>
<p class="pullQuote"><b>I had no issues taking the Karma out to 3,000 feet, just within the limits of its default geofence.</b></p>
<p>I don’t see a GoPro action camera as an ideal tool for aerials. Its size is right, but the ultra-wide lens with a modest fish-eye effect is simply too wide for a lot of aerial applications. This is why most drones with integrated cameras have moved to narrower lenses—the DJI Phantom 4 series uses a 20mm-equivalent prime, and the Mavic Pro is a little bit narrower at 25mm. When you’re performing tricks or flips on a big bike ramp, having a tighter lens, which puts more distance between you and the aircraft, can be a blessing, and the 25mm scope is a fine choice for aerial landscape photography and videography.</p>
<p>That said, if you prefer ultra-wide, the GoPro delivers solid results. Its ProTune mode delivers crisp video with your option of a Flat or GoPro color profile—the former is a plus for those who want to color-grade their footage. What you don’t get is the ability to adjust exposure on the fly. Most drones let you brighten or darken a video using EV compensation when working in automatic exposure and set a manual exposure using a specified shutter speed and ISO. That’s not the case with the Karma—the exposure the camera thinks is right is the one you get. That’s a major downside for its use as a tool for aerial videography.</p>
<p>The Hero5 Black does shoot images in Raw, and its GPR file format is supported by the current version of Lightroom CC and Adobe Camera Raw.</p>

<p><b>VERY GRIPPING</b></p>
<p><b>The included Karma Grip lets you use your GoPro in a handheld manner, with as much stabilization as you get in the air. It has its own internal battery and keeps your camera straight and level, even when walking. Think of it like a handheld Steadicam.</b></p>

    </div><h3><b>CONCLUSIONS</b></h3><p>The GoPro Karma took a while to get off the ground, but you can go out and buy one today. And while brand devotees who already own a compatible GoPro action cam may see some upsides—including the bundled Karma Grip and relatively attractive price point—I don’t think it should be your first choice. The lack of obstacle avoidance and the ultra-wide GoPro field of view are downsides, as is the omission of an automated follow mode.</p>
<p>The Karma also isn’t as portable as GoPro would like you to think. Though it folds and has a shorter minimum height than an entry-level DJI Phantom 3 Standard, it still must be carried in its own case. The Mavic Pro is still the only truly small drone on the market that doesn’t leave any features on the table. Its remote control is the size of a video game controller, and it folds to about the size of a water bottle—small enough to simply toss in your messenger bag.</p>
<p>Our Editors’ Choice in this price range is the DJI Phantom 4. It’s larger than the Karma but can be carried in a small case or backpack. It sells for less than the Karma and features obstacle avoidance, subject tracking, and 4K capture.</p>
