    </div><p>Digital art creation, engineering, architecture, and graphic design are complicated and often require multiple computers and peripherals. Microsoft set out to change that—and to bring more creatives to the Windows platform—with the Surface Studio (starting at $2,999; $4,199 as tested), a touch-screen all-in-one (AIO) PC that can stand upright like a traditional desktop display or recline to serve as a digital canvas, letting designers draw, sketch, and edit as they would on a dedicated drawing tablet or physical medium. It’s all wrapped up in a thin, thoughtfully designed package, making it equal parts attractive, innovative, and useful. It’s expensive and lacks cutting-edge components, but the Surface Studio still manages to easily earn our Editors’ Choice endorsement for high-end AIO PCs.</p>
<h3><b>DIGITAL DRAFTING BOARD</b></h3><p>First, a quick rundown for the uninitiated: The Surface Studio all-in-one PC is the first desktop in Microsoft’s hit Surface line, which has set the benchmark for convertible laptops. In keeping with that spirit but tying it squarely to your desk, the Studio’s super-thin 28-inch touch screen can tilt from an upright setup (what Microsoft calls Desktop Mode) to a reclined, canvas-like state (Studio Mode). The screen is just 0.44-inch thick, while the components and ports are all housed in a base that measures 1.26 by 8.66 by 9.84 inches (HWD).</p>
<p>The Studio’s design and build are gorgeous. The look is undeniably iMac-inspired, but the convertibility and glinting metal legs attaching the screen to the base give the Studio a distinctive look. The “gravity hinge” can stop at any point between fully upright and reclined. It slides effortlessly between modes, and you can push the screen down or up with a single finger.</p>
<p>The display bears a PixelSense resolution of 4,500 by 3,000, which includes 63 percent more pixels than a 4K television (192ppi). The Apple iMac With 5K Retina Display, by comparison, has a 27-inch screen with 5,210-by-2,880 resolution, though it’s tough to compare directly, because the Studio’s aspect ratio is also different than standard wide-screen. Its 3:2 ratio was chosen with designers in mind, as one inch on the screen represents one inch in reality, better mirroring physical work in a digital space.</p>

<p><b>WE’RE CONVERTED</b></p>
<p><b>The Surface Studio all-in-one desktop, is the first non-mobile device in Microsoft’s hit Surface line, which has set the benchmark for convertible laptops.</b></p>
</figcaption>
    
    
    
    </div><p><b>Microsoft Surface Studio</b></p>
<p><b>PROS Stunning design. Elegant all-in-one digital creation solution. Fast performance. Super-thin display with fantastic image quality. Responsive, accurate touch screen for art and design work.</b></p>
<p><b>CONS Doesn’t use the latest components. Lacks expandability options.</b></p>
<p>The screen is incredibly crisp and vibrant, suiting the work many creative types will use it for. The colors are bold and bright—the display uses 10-bit color depth and supports the P3 and SRGB color gamuts, which you can swap between on the fly. It’s brilliantly bright on the default Vivid color profile (so much so that the maximum setting hurt my eyes up close at times, driving me to lower it down a notch). You won’t have to worry about images appearing too dim. Fingerprints do smudge up the screen, but you can really see them only when it’s powered off.</p>
<p>Of course, exceptional screen quality alone is not what will have designers flocking to the Surface Studio: Its convertibility is what makes this high-end all-in-one desktop a real artist’s workstation. With the display folded down, draw directly on it becomes infinitely easier compared with a traditional upright monitor, and that’s what gives the Surface Studio its unique value.</p>
<p>Microsoft is aggressively targeting the creative demographic, which has been Apple’s bread and butter with the iMac and MacBooks for years. This is obvious with additions in the Windows 10 Creators Update such as Paint 3D and upgrades to Windows Ink.</p>

<p><b>QUITE RESOLVED</b></p>
<p><b>The display has a PixelSense resolution of 4,500 by 3,000, which includes 63 percent more pixels than a 4K television.</b></p>

    </div><p>By embracing touch capability on the hardware and software fronts (while Apple continues to relegate touch to iOS only), the Surface Studio could feasibly become the go-to for designers and artists. More important, it continues the transformation of Windows and PCs as stodgy and business-centric to stylish, versatile platforms for a new generation of professionals, creatives, and students.</p>
<p>That brings us to the topic of price, which will likely have many potential buyers balking. The Surface Studio is clearly an expensive product, with the starting configuration alone at $2,999, but it’s priced relatively competitively when you look at what you’re getting. Comparably sized drawing displays don’t double as powerful computers or feature the Studio’s engineering, but they still cost upward of $2,000. For example, the 27-inch Wacom QHD Cintiq is $2,799, and though you can hook it up to a PC or Mac for digital creation, you’ll still need to buy that computer. When you account for graphics, processing, storage, and a super-high-resolution display, the Studio’s price actually starts to look reasonable.</p>
<h3><b>PORTS AND PERIPHERALS</b></h3><p>All ports are located on the back of the base. They’re a bit difficult to access, particularly when the screen is reclined, since you have to reach around it or turn the whole machine around. But this placement keeps the flush, sleek look intact. There are four USB 3.0 ports (one is a high-power port), an SD card reader, a mini DisplayPort connection, and a headset jack. USB-C connectivity is notably absent.</p>

<p><b>CONNECTIONS</b></p>
<p><b>The Studio has four USB 3.0 ports (one is a high power port), an SD card reader, a mini DisplayPort connection, and a headset jack, all located on the rear.</b></p>
</figcaption>
    
    
    
    </div><p>The Studio comes with a wireless keyboard and wireless mouse, both of which connect via Bluetooth 4.0. These are also very iMac-like in look and feel, and they get the job done. I don’t find the low-profile mouse particularly comfortable, but Apple faithfuls likely won’t mind it. The keyboard is satisfying to type on.</p>
<p>The Surface Pen stylus is also included. It works well with the Studio, with little to no latency between strokes and response on the screen. The “eraser” button is customizable, as is a skinny strip along the side you can set as right click, paste, or something else, depending on your workflow. By default it brings up the Windows Ink Workspace software for quickly launching into note-taking and drawing. Magnetic strips on either side of the display, like the Surface Pro, attach the Pen when it’s not in use.</p>
<p>We also tested the Surface Dial ($99), though it isn’t included. The Dial is not an instrument for drawing but is an aid for tool and menu selection. You can press and spin the Dial to scroll through various on-screen options. Placing it directly on the display and pressing down brings up a digital radial menu around the physical Dial, with options including Volume, Brightness, and Undo, all of which looks and feels very futuristic. It doesn’t take long to learn how to use the Dial; I was flipping between settings and changing tools with ease within a few minutes. Whether it will speed up your process depends on your workflow, but it helped me save time.</p>
<p>The bottom of the Dial is rubber to help grip the screen, but I found that it slowly slides down when the Studio is at any angle other than fully reclined. This shouldn’t be a problem most of the time—the Dial will most likely be used alongside the Pen in Studio Mode. Keeping the bottom clean helps grip, and the Dial also works when it’s simply sitting on your desk.</p>
<p>Beyond the peripherals, the Studio integrates 802.11ac Wi-Fi and wireless support for Xbox controllers (connecting them to a PC typically requires you to purchase Microsoft’s Wireless Adapter). You also get two front-facing cameras. One is a 5-megapixel cam for Windows Hello sign-in. When you set up Hello, it scans your face once and recognizes you in the future, allowing you to log in by standing in front of the screen instead of typing in a password. The other 1080p camera is for video chats.</p>
<p class="pullQuote"><b>The Studio’s design and functionality are praise-worthy, but I have a few reservations about its components.</b></p>

    </div><p>Speakers are also built into the Studio and have a loud maximum volume with good sound quality. They’re of better quality than most built-in speakers on standalone displays, though certainly not on a par with those on the room-shaking Dell XPS 27 AIO.</p>
<h3><b>UNDER THE HOOD</b></h3><p>The Studio’s design and functionality are praiseworthy, but I have a few reservations about its components. It’s a fast system by any measure, but considering the high-stress workloads of creative users, some inclusions could be cause for concern.</p>
<p>Though generally speedy, thanks in part to 32GB of memory, the Core i7 Skylake processor and GTX 980M graphics card are a generation behind. This could be because the Studio has been in development through the launch of newer components (using a Kaby Lake CPU or Pascal graphics would have presumably delayed its release). Cost concerns or engineering obstacles could also be the culprits. Either way, the Surface Studio’s internal hardware isn’t quite cutting edge, which is disappointing for the price, and a (likely inevitable) refreshed version with newer components would really knock it out of the park.</p>

<div class="">		

    
        
    
                                                                                                                                            <img src="/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0071-0126/146827-1-eng-US/f0071-012.jpg" width="1219" height="692"  style="border: 0px  ;" alt="f0071-01" title="f0071-01" />

    </div><p>Storage comes in the form of a hybrid drive similar to Apple’s fusion format. Our test unit includes a 2TB drive, while the base and midrange models each include 1TB. Rather than provide solid-state storage (not an option on any of the Studio’s configurations), Microsoft includes a hybrid hard drive that utilizes an SSD cache, but data is stored on the 5,400rpm hard drive. In spite of this, and a bit to my surprise, load times were still comparable with those of solid-state storage. The computer boots very quickly, and programs launch with little or no delay.</p>
<p>This leads to the issue of expandability, which is something you’ll have to live without if you buy the Studio. Like most all-in-ones, the machine is ready-to-go as ordered and will stay exactly that way, since you can’t open it up to add more RAM or storage. That might be enough to deter some potential buyers, since it’s an expensive product you won’t be able to upgrade down the road, but it’s nothing new for the category or for anyone who’s worked on an iMac. External and cloud storage will be your friends (as they likely already are for artists), even with the roomy drive.</p>
<h3><b>PERFORMANCE</b></h3><p>Just how fast is the Surface Studio? It’s plenty zippy, especially since the gap between the Skylake and Kaby Lake processors is not nearly as pronounced as some generations past. The 2.7GHz Intel Core i7-6820HQ CPU and 32GB of memory powered it to a strong score on the PCMark 8 Work Conventional productivity test, even at its demanding native resolution.</p>
<p>Multimedia test scores were also solid. It completed the Handbrake test in 1 minute and 3 seconds, Photoshop in 3:03, and scored 702 points on CineBench. These results were all faster than the 2015 5K iMac (1:15, 3:19, and 510 points), but not by the margin you’d hope for a newer, pricey desktop.</p>
<p class="pullQuote"><b>This leads to the issue of expandability, which is something you’ll have to live without if you buy the Studio.</b></p>
<p>That extends to the last-gen graphics hardware as well, though it matters a bit less since this isn’t a gaming system. A 980M was among the best graphics hardware for laptops last generation, so it’s a capable 3D card and a lot better than integrated graphics. Gaming isn’t the Studio’s purpose, but 3D performance for model rendering and manipulation (say, for CAD, architectural, and medical use) is aided by the GPU, so high-powered discrete graphics fits the bill.</p>
<p>It is still a mobile card, though, so it can’t go toe-to-toe with gaming desktops like the Corsair One Pro or even the Digital Storm Aura, which is also an all-in-one. That said, the Studio is a capable performer at 1080p, averaging 55 frames per second (fps) on the Heaven and Valley gaming tests on Ultra-quality settings in HD. Don’t expect it to run much in native resolution (though few computers could do so smoothly), but you can definitely manage some high-setting HD gaming on the side. It’s not VR-ready, however, since the Pascal GTX 1060 graphics card is the recommended entry point for virtual reality gaming, and the 980M does not reach that mark.</p>
<h3><b>CONCLUSION</b></h3><p>The Surface Studio delivers on Microsoft’s vision of creating a digital drafting board and an efficient desktop in a single package. On top of that unique proposition, it’s a beautiful and cleverly designed piece of hardware with a stunning display.</p>

<p>I have some misgivings about the component decisions, but that doesn’t mean the system is slow or not up to the task. Growing pains are to be expected as a new product type is introduced, yet the core concept is well executed. It’s a successful proof of concept in Microsoft’s bid for reinventing both the digital artist’s workspace and the perception and function of Windows as a creator’s platform.</p>
<p>You might want to wait for Version 2.0 with newer parts if you’re concerned about performance. But I can assure you that in its current form, the Microsoft Surface Studio is a joy to use and work on. It’s a beautiful, innovative marriage of form and function, and an easy Editors’ Choice.</p>
