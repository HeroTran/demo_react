    </div><p><b>S</b>o the 15-inch display on your laptop is starting to feel cramped, and you work mainly in one location. You could attach an additional screen to your notebook or opt for a desktop tower with a separate monitor, but you have another option: an all-in-one (AIO) desktop. For about the same amount of money you’d spend on a midrange-to-high-end laptop with a 17-inch screen (or more likely, less), you can get an AIO desktop PC with a 23-inch-or-larger screen. Here’s what to consider when shopping for an all-in-one PC. (Also, take a look at our review of the Microsoft Surface Studio AIO in this issue.).</p>
<h3><b>DISPLAY</b></h3><p>The first thing to look for in an all-in-one is the screen. Lower-priced AIO PCs come with 20-inch screens, but those are better suited to cramped spaces such as classroom labs or dorm rooms. What you really want is a display at least 23 inches on the diagonal—and larger is better, if you can manage it. (The biggest all-in-ones we’ve seen to date have had curved 34-inch screens.) You’re almost guaranteed a 1,920-by-1,080-resolution (full HD) screen at this size, and larger screens will go even higher—up to 4K in many cases, or 3,440 by 1,440 on an ultra-wide display.</p>
<p>That gives you the ability to view multiple windows side by side or view a three- to four-page-wide spreadsheet. And if you’re a multitasker, the more screen room, the better. Though it’s not a concern for those with 20/10 or better vision, a larger screen and higher resolution let you increase the font size on your Word documents and Excel spreadsheets, while still keeping a lot of information on the screen.</p>
<p>Desktop screens are brighter than laptop displays in general, as well. Look for In-Plane Switching (IPS) technology for the best screen quality. IPS screens are inherently better at off-axis viewing, which means you won’t have to be sitting perfectly centered to see accurate colors and all the detail in your images.</p>
<h3><b>TOUCH-SCREEN AIOS</b></h3><p>The tiled Start interface in Windows 10 was designed with touch screens in mind and makes interacting with your various applications as easy as it’s ever been. But although these can be fun and functional for families, a touch screen isn’t 100 percent necessary (yet). That’s especially true for those who plan to use the all-in-one like a traditional computer, in which case a keyboard and mouse work better.</p>
<p>Some touch gestures in macOS as well could take advantage of a touch screen, but for Macs, it’s also not a necessity. Scrolling with a mouse or a touchpad is still as quick or quicker than scrolling on a touch screen. Selecting text for copy and paste is easier with a mouse. If you fill out forms online and switch between text-entry boxes, pull-down menus, and checkboxes, then it’s likely that you’ll be able to enter data more quickly with a keyboard and mouse or touchpad.</p>
<p>If you’re planning on using the touch screen at least 50 percent of the time, look for systems with screens that can recline down to horizontal (90 degrees) or almost horizontal. This lets you use the system like a large tablet, so you don’t have to hold your arm out constantly to use the touch screen. It’s simple ergonomics.</p>
<p>Some AIO stands let you pivot the screen into a portrait orientation. Portrait mode lets you view content such as webpages and some pictures without wasted space to the sides of the screen. It’s a boon for Web developers and layout artists working on print publications. If Portrait mode is something you want, make sure the system features auto-rotate; without it, you’ll need to switch display settings every time you pivot the display.</p>

    </div><h3><b>COMPONENTS AND PERIPHERALS</b></h3><p>You can get a dual-core processor in a base configuration, but we recommend you look for a true quad-core processor on a large-screen AIO PC. It helps with editing photos and videos or playing music in the background while you work on several tasks in the foreground. The minimum system memory you should accept is about 6GB to 8GB. Although 4GB is fine for basic users, you’ll feel the limits of such a system. That said, 8GB or 16GB lets you keep dozens of tabs open on your browser and still have room left over for Photoshop.</p>
<p>As for storage, if you’re going to store any video on your PC, bear in mind that videos tend to clog up hard drives faster than just about any other type of file. Look for a hard drive of at least 1TB capacity; heavy download fans should grab a 2TB drive. The only issue is that a traditional spinning hard drive is relatively slow booting and loading apps.</p>
<p>For a system that’s more a speed demon than a file storage unit, look for an AIO that uses a solid-state drive (SSD) as the boot drive. If you keep all your files on a central network-attached storage (NAS) device or stored on in the cloud, just about any SSD or hard drive larger than 128GB will be sufficient. That’s enough for the operating system and a handful of frequently used programs.</p>
<p>You can have the best of both worlds with an all-in-one PC that boots from a SSD but has an additional spinning hard drive for storage. Power users should look for a 128GB boot drive and at least 1TB of hard drive storage. You’ll need more storage (2TB to 4TB) to keep your entire video, music, and photo collection on your AIO.</p>
<p>Adding an extra 1TB or so is also easy with an external drive. SSDs cost more per gigabyte than regular spinning hard drives, but SSDs boot up and wake from sleep much faster than regular drives. Adding a 32GB cache SSD can speed up some tasks—loading apps, for example. But for true speed, get a “real” SSD as your primary (C:) drive. Unfortunately, some of the new AIO PCs are hard to upgrade after checkout, so make sure you get what you need at the start.</p>
<p>An all-in-one should have all the ports you need during your day-to-day activities, particularly USB (in easy-to-access places, if possible). You may also want an Ethernet port, though most all-in-ones today come with Wi-Fi support built in, so you can easily hook it up to the wireless network you already have in your home. Also handy is an HDMI input port, which gives you the flexibility to use the all-in-one as a display for a separate PC or other device.</p>
<p>You’ll want a system with a wireless keyboard and mouse or touchpad. Although you could use the on-screen equivalents on a touch screen, using a touch screen for everything can get tiring, especially when you’re typing for more than a minute or two. It’s also easier to use a mouse or touchpad than a touch screen when selecting large blocks of text for cut/paste operations.</p>
<p>Two new subcategories of AIOs have appeared recently. The first is the battery-equipped, portable all-in-one desktop. It uses mobile components including ultraportable-class processors, low-power storage devices such as SSDs, and touch screens to give you a tablet-like experience. These PCs run full versions of Windows and Windows-compatible software, so they’re more capable than most mobile devices. A built-in battery pack gives you a few hours of unplugged computing, but their 18- to 27-inch screens are way too large to use on an airline tray table. Better to think of them as portable PCs that you can move from room to room easily.</p>
<p class="pullQuote"><b>You might even be able to upgrade this type of all-in-one yourself, which would help future-proof it.</b></p>
<p>The other newcomer are much larger machines that use desktop-caliber parts (such as processors and graphics cards) to offer you just as much power as you’d get in a full-size tower PC. You might even be able to upgrade this type of all-in-one yourself, which would help future-proof it against improvements in technology over the years you own it.</p>
<h3><b>THE PROS OF AIOS</b></h3><p>Even if you can afford a 20-inch-or-larger laptop, you wouldn’t be able to carry it around without looking ridiculous. You’d also need strong arms to move a 17-inch-or-larger laptop, and you’d need to resemble a WWE wrestler to have a lap that could accommodate one. Since AIO desktops are plugged in, you can leave your system in sleep mode for months. Some AIO systems with SSDs can update while sleeping, like newer ultraportable laptops. Because they use more powerful processors, all-in-one PCs take care of your tasks quicker. Some 3D games are also smoother, thanks to discrete graphics cards in some AIO PCs.</p>
<p>You can share the PC with family members and use it to store centrally accessible photos, music, and videos. A large widescreen AIO PC makes for a fine video conferencing system. Rather than having the family crowd around your 7-inch tablet or 11-inch laptop, seat them in front of a 27- or 34-inch AIO desktop, so you’re not squeezing together to “fit on the screen.” Also, a large screen is good for watching a movie from 10 feet away, so a few people can use it as a HDTV in your den equipped with a small sofa or loveseat. If you place the system in a central location, such as your kitchen counter, you can monitor your children when they’re online.</p>
<h3><b>THE CONS</b></h3><p>Since they have large screens, AIO PCs are physically larger than laptops. Of course, with most AIOs, you give up the ability to move them easily from room to room, though they’re still more portable than tower PCs. All-in-one PCs don’t have the expandability that you’re going to find in most towers, but towers lack the sleekness factor. That said, towers are still better than all-in-one PCs when you need to do intensive work such as CAD/CAM or scientific exploration, and most of them are expandable in ways well beyond even the most generous AIO on the market.</p>

The Envy Curved 34-A051 is more comfortable for multitasking than a traditional desktop with a dual-monitor setup, and it has the power to blaze through tasks, quickly.
