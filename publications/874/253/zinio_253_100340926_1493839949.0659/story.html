    </div><p><b>M</b>icrosoft Photos, the free photo viewer and editor that comes with Windows 10, has been updated with with the Creators Update of the operating system (see our recap of the update in What’s New Now). It now combines decent image editing capabilities with additional filters and an even simpler, more touch-friendly interface. It also lets you mark up images with drawing, powers search with AI automatic object tagging, and even lets you trim video clips. Microsoft Photos is a delightful way to work with digital images, and could even replace higher-end photo software, though it lacks a few tricks, including face recognition and a map view.</p>
<h3><b>STARTING UP</b></h3><p>The app is included with Windows 10, and it replaces the Windows Photo Gallery app of yore. You can no longer download the older app, which added panorama stitching, collage, and sharpening tools. If you’ve got Windows 10, you don’t need to do anything to get the newer app—like the OS X’s Photos app, it’s just there. If Photos isn’t among your Windows 10 PC’s apps, you can always get it from the Windows (app) Store. Note that Windows still comes with Paint, which is more about one-at-a-time image resizing, drawing, and saving to different image formats. Starting with Windows 10 Creators Update, you also get Paint 3D, which offers easy 3D modeling, decoration, and sharing.</p>
<h3><b>CLEAR INTERFACE</b></h3><p>Photos’ interface has three main modes: Collection, Albums, and Folders. Collection is everything organized by date, and Albums are both automatically created ones and ones you create yourself. Folders shows images by file location. From any mode, you can click into an individual photo for viewing and editing. A handy back-arrow is always present at top left.</p>

<p><b>COLLECTION MODE Photos’ Collection presents all the photos on your PC, whether they’re locally saved image files, screenshots, or OneDrive photo files, in date groups.</b></p>

    </div><p><b>Microsoft Photos</b></p>
<p><b>(for Windows 10)</b></p>
<p><b>PROS Simple, touch-friendly interface. Fast. Good photo browsing features. Solid selection of image-correction tools. Automatically creates albums.</b></p>
<p><b>CONS No star ratings. Lacks before-and-after view. Cannot tag faces. Does not support panorama stitching or selective focus.</b></p>
<p>Microsoft Photos is geared toward simplicity and touchability. By contrast, Apple’s Photos app on the Mac supports only the limited though well implemented touch capabilities of the latest MacBooks’ Touch Bar. Zooming and unzooming are simple matters of a tap on the image or a spin of the mouse wheel. But I wish Microsoft Photos had a before-and-after viewing feature to take you back to the original during editing.</p>
<p>A big change in Microsoft Photos’ interface is the use of horizontal sliders, which replace the circular dial controls used to adjust brightness and other options. The circular controls were innovative, but they did take some getting used to, while the sliders are completely familiar. Microsoft Photos has no trouble with high-DPI displays like that of my 4K-resolution Asus Zen AiO Pro Z240IC all-in-one PC test machine.</p>
<h3><b>VIEWING AND ORGANIZING PHOTOS</b></h3><p>Any images in your Microsoft Photos user folder and its subfolders (including Screenshots) show up in the app. Videos in those folders also appear. You can add any other folders on your system to view their contents in the Folders section, as well as enabling viewing of OneDrive cloud folders. Including OneDrive means that any photos shot on smartphones set up with auto-upload appear in the Collection view. The Photos app also includes an Import option that works with any storage device you plug into the computer. It supports raw camera files, though those from newly released or uncommon models weren’t yet supported when I tested.</p>
<p>One organization highlight is that Microsoft Photos creates albums for you based on date groupings, just as Apple Photos does with Memories. The difference is that in the Windows app, you can edit the albums to taste. Apple assumes it knows better than you, and it alone chooses which photos go in your Memories. Both let you share online galleries via a link.</p>
<p>You can also create your own custom albums, and adding shots is a snap either from within the album or from photo view. When you’re viewing an individual photo, options include zoom, enhance, edit, and share. You can also play a slideshow or draw on the photo. The drawing tool works with mouse, stylus, or finger, and the selection of tips and colors is decent. The eraser, however, is a bit blunt, erasing only an entire stroke rather than letting you touch up your drawing.</p>

                                                                                                                                            <img src="/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0089-0121/147061-1-eng-US/f0089-012.jpg" width="1215" height="663"  style="border: 0px  ;" alt="f0089-01" title="f0089-01" />
        		<figcaption style="display:none">
<p><b>ALBUMS YOUR WAY</b></p>
<p><b>You can create Albums yourself or have the app create them for you automatically; it bases them on date groupings, and you can edit them afterward (which you can’t do with the albums created by Apple Photos).</b></p>
</figcaption>
    
    
    
    </div><p>There are a few views missing that I’d like to see. For example, there’s no map view of all your geotagged photos, which includes nearly all mobile photos. You do, however, see a map location on individual photos’ File Info panels, available from a right-click. That also shows EXIF data and file dimensions.</p>
<p>Nor is there a way to rate photos with stars or apply keyword tags, though you can do both of those things in File Explorer. But in a nice nod to moving picture support, you can trim the start and end of video clips in the Photos app and even draw on them as you can on photos. Those abilities hardly make up for Windows’ no longer including a real video-editing option, though.</p>
<h3><b>EDITING PHOTOS</b></h3><p>The app’s Enhance tool is accessible right on the photo-viewer page, without making you go into the editing view. I found that it usually bumps up contrast and saturation, and often does make for a better-looking image, if one somewhat lacking in the drabness of reality. It’s pretty good with skies, knocking back highlights for a better look at the clouds. You can set Enhance to be applied to all photos by default, and turn it off later if you’re not pleased with the result. It did a really nice job correcting white balance on an overly warm indoor shot.</p>
<p>When you enter Edit mode, a slider lets you adjust the automatic Enhance. There are also 15 more effects to play with (up from 5 in the last version), and the strength of each is adjustable, too. Four B&amp;W options are among them, with different levels of contrast and sharpness. It’s effective to apply one of these and scale back the slider for just a smidge of color. I was happy to see that the app lets you not only adjust exposure and contrast, but also highlights and shadows. Color editing is an option, too, as is the Clarity slider (similar to the one in Adobe Lightroom), which bumps up (and down) sharpness and black point.</p>
<p>Microsoft Photos no longer offers a selective-focus (aka tilt-shift) tool as it did in its previous incarnation, but it does have simple and effective red-eye and blemish-removal tools, and a vignette slider is available in the Adjust tools.</p>
<p>Once you’ve perfected your edits, you can either save a copy or overwrite the original. When just viewing rather than editing an image, however, there’s no option to save the picture as a different file type or to a different location.</p>

    </div><h3><b>SHARING AND OUTPUT</b></h3><p>As mentioned above, you can build albums and share them as online galleries on OneDrive. The recipient doesn’t need a OneDrive account. For more ad-hoc sharing, simply hit the up-arrow icon to send the current image to any photo-accepting UWP app installed on your PC—Facebook, Messenger, WhatsApp, Twitter, and so on. The share panel has a new position in Windows 10 Creators Update, right in the center of the screen instead of off to the side as in earlier builds. Microsoft Photos has no built-in photo printing service, and the Windows apps for Snapfish, PhotoAffections, and Walgreens didn’t offer share targets at the time of testing. Big services Shutterfly, Winkflash, York, and RitzPix don’t even offer apps. The situation contrasts markedly with Apple Photos on macOS, which offers photo, book, and poster printing right from within the app. Of course, a simple website visit can get your Windows photos printed with the services mentioned above.</p>
<p class="pullQuote"><b>The app’s Enhance tool is accessible right on the photo-viewer page, without making you go into the editing view.</b></p>
<p>A final sharing option is to send an album to Sway. This is an online Office component that lets you build a storytelling website. You can add titles and captions with lots of design choices. It also lets you add tweets and file downloads from Facebook and OneDrive, along with custom embed code.</p>
<h3><b>CONCLUSION</b></h3><p>For viewing, tuning up, and sharing your digital photos, the free Microsoft Photos stands at the ready. After using photo programs loaded down with menus and panels and features, it can be a joy to use one that’s simple and clear and has what you need for basic viewing and fixes. For really powerful photo organization, optimization, and effects, you need a full-featured application such as CyberLink PhotoDirector or one of our Editors’ Choices—Photoshop Elements, Lightroom, or Photoshop CC. But for most users, most of the time, Microsoft Photos is a solid choice for managing, editing, and sharing photos.</p>
