    </div><p><b>B</b>rowsing the web, playing games, editing video, and other activities slowly wear down your PC, as your operating system and hard drive fill up with abandoned registry items, forgotten files, and general computing detritus. As a result, your once-snappy machine may take longer to boot, crash with greater frequency, lock up more often, or experience an increased number of errors. tuneup utility Glary Utilities Pro leverages a collection of more than 20 tools to kick these problems to the curb. The app is easy to use and improves your system’s performance, but its license limitations and lack of software descriptions relegate it to the middle-of-the-pack status.</p>
<h3><b>COST AND COMPATIBILITY</b></h3><p>Glary Utilities Pro is a lightweight application for Windows 10 8, 7, Vista, and XP computers that downloads and installs quickly. The software offers disk cleanup, registry repair, and junk-file removal tools, which is standard fare for tuneup utilities. It also has a handful of useful features not found in the free version of Glary Utilities, including automatic software updates and the ability to schedule tuneup times.</p>
<p>On the down side, a Glary Utilities Pro subscription grants you just three licenses. That number is a decent amount, but if you live in a household with many computers, the license limitation may prove troublesome—and possibly costly. Iolo, on the other hand, lets you install its System Mechanic tuneup suite onto as many PCs as you’d like.</p>
<h3><b>FEATURES</b></h3><p>You begin by initiating a system scan to identify problems on your PC. You can tackle all of the issues at once using Gary Utilities Pro’s 1-Click Maintenance feature, or you can choose to fix individual sections one at a time. Regardless of your approach, clicking the Repair Problems icon after the scans are complete begins the cleanup process. The tuneup time varies from a few minutes to a few hours, depending on your PC’s state of disarray. My worn test PC, with its out-of-date drivers, splintered registry, and hard drive full of junk, took close to an hour to clean.</p>

<p><b>EXTRAS</b></p>
<p><b>The Pro version of Glary Utilities includes automatic software updates and the ability to schedule tune-up times.</b></p>

    </div><p><b>Glary Utilities Pro</b></p>
<p><b>PROS Good system-performance improvement. Simple, easy-to-use interface. Lets you manage which programs launch when a PC boots. Built-in secure-deletion tool. Privacy-protecting features. Integrated driver updater.</b></p>
<p><b>CONS License limitations. Lacks in-depth software descriptions.</b></p>
<p>Glary Utilities Pro prompts you to remove unwanted software and junk files, but unlike SlimWare Utilities SlimCleaner Plus, it doesn’t provide detailed descriptions, which is a missed opportunity for educating subscribers. Many—if not most—people will simply delete items without much thought, which can be risky. Fortunately, Glary Utilities Pro has backup and restore functionality that may prove a technological godsend for those moments when you carelessly bork your PC and need to turn back the clock.</p>
<p>The program also lacks community-based ratings that can help you determine which apps you should keep. I prefer SlimWare Utilities’ much more informative approach, which helps you decide what should be removed and teaches you about programs’ functions, too.</p>
<p>On the upside, Glary Utilities Pro contains an incredibly helpful driver updater that seeks out fresh drivers when the ones that are installed on your PC go out of date. Glary Utilities Pro identified half a dozen dust-covered, outdated drivers on my test system and downloaded the newest versions so that my hardware and software could return to peak operating efficiency.</p>
<p>You can schedule tuneup times so that Glary Utilities Pro handles the cleaning and repair tasks at specified hours. This isn’t an unusual feature—Anvisoft Cloud System Booster, CCleaner Professional Plus, and other quality tuneup utilities have this feature—but it’s always welcome.</p>

    </div><p>Other useful features include the Startup Manager and File Shredder tools. The former lets you limit the software that launches as your PC boots, thus reducing boot time. The latter securely overwrites deleted files so that they’re very difficult to recover. It’s a feature that proves useful when it comes time to get rid of sensitive data, such as tax-preparation information.</p>
<p>Glary Utilities Pro’s many features are easy to access and activate. The tuneup package has an easy-to-understand interface that makes navigation a breeze. Its blue-and-white color scheme is easy on the eyes, too, which is one of the more overlooked aspects of utility software. Just because you’re working in your PC’s trenches doesn’t mean the software you’re using can’t also look good!</p>

    </div><h3><b>TESTING GROUNDS</b></h3><p>I tested Glary Utilities Pro’s PC-improvement chops by performing two tests— running the Geekbench system performance tool and measuring boot times— before and after running the tuneup utility suite. I ran each test three times and averaged the results. Before Glary applied its magic to my laptop (a 2GHz Intel Core i7 X990 Style-Note notebook with Windows 7, 4GB of RAM, and an 80GB Intel SSD drive), the system achieved a 5,914 Geekbench score and booted in 50.3 seconds.</p>
<p>My testbed’s performance improved after I ran Glary Utilities Pro. The GeekBench score rose to 6,111 (a bit behind SlimCleaner Plus’ 6,218 mark) and the boot time decreased to 45.2 seconds (a bit behind Iolo System Mechanic’s 44.2 seconds).</p>
<p>Those numbers represent solid improvements, but they wouldn’t mean a thing if they didn’t have any swing—and fortunately, they do. After running Glary Utilities Pro, my testbed opened windows and apps with an extra pep that wasn’t present when the machine was packed with crap. Even Steam and the notoriously bloated iTunes felt snappier. Still, Iolo System Mechanic and SlimCleaner Plus offer superior all-around performance enhancements that are reflected in both their better performance numbers and the superior responsiveness of the PCs they tune up.</p>
<p class="pullQuote"><b>Its blue-and-white color scheme is easy on the eyes, too, which is one of the more overlooked aspects of utility software.</b></p>
<h3><b>CONCLUSION</b></h3><p>Glary Utilities Pro is a capable tuneup utility that invigorates junked-up PCs with its defragmentation, deletion, and boot-up management tools. The software should do more to stand out from the competition, though. Should Glarysoft update a future version of Utilities Pro so that it offers software descriptions and unlimited licenses, it could join Iolo System Mechanic and SlimWare Utilities SlimCleaner Plus as our Editors’ Choice picks. For now, Glary Utilities Pro is a solid choice, but it’s not the best you can get.</p>
