    </div><p><b>A</b>n organized, up-to-date, and fully backed-up address book would be my dream come true. Anyone who has had to replace a phone unexpectedly because it was lost, stolen, or damaged knows how important it is to have a backup of their contacts list. And we all have that friend who’s posted on social media, “I lost my phone. Text me on this number and tell me who you are.”</p>
<p>Like most people, my contacts are all over the place. I work to keep family and friends’ information up to date in Apple Contacts. The email addresses of most my work associates are in my business email account. My personal Gmail and other personal email accounts have a smattering of useful information in their associated contacts lists, but they’re also littered with auto-saved information, including every organization to which I’ve ever emailed a support@ message.</p>
<p>Many companies have tried to solve the problem of having scattered contacts saved across different databases. I’ve tried plenty of solutions, and the sad truth is I haven’t found one with every feature I want in a centralized address book.</p>
<h3><b>BUILD YOUR OWN</b></h3><p>A few years back, I experimented with ad-hoc methods of generating custom contacts lists, mostly by using IFTTT. This project wasn’t a complete failure, but it ended up generating spreadsheets, which aren’t all that user friendly or fun to search from a mobile device.</p>
<p>For those who like to have a lot of control, however, building your own contacts list may be the way to go. Just be sure to back it up and save it someplace that’s accessible to you from a mobile device so you can make phone calls and pull up people’s addresses when you’re at the post office mailing gifts (my two most important use cases, aside from email).</p>

    </div><h3><b>THIRD-PARTY CONTACT OPTIONS</b></h3><p>A number of mobile apps do a decent job of merging and syncing contact information from many sources. FullContact (Android, iOS, web) is pretty good. You connect it to email accounts and other online services that have contacts lists associated with them, and it merges multiple databases into one. But then it does something different: FullContact scours the web for up-to-date information on those same contacts.</p>
<p>When I started writing this article, I hadn’t used FullContact in a while, so I ran my contacts through its magical process. At first, I was shocked to learn that a fairly high-level editor I knew was now apparently also president of an organization that dabbled in advertising! What a sellout, I thought. But they I went digging online for more information and it turns out it was someone else with the same name. Unfortunately, FullContact hadn’t given me enough context to realize I was dealing with the wrong guy, which is a problem you also might run into with this app.</p>
<p class="pullQuote"><b>Cloze connects with social media accounts, giving you more insight into what your contacts are doing.</b></p>
<p>Cloze (Android, iOS, web) is another app I’ve turned to now and then, although it’s become more of a customer-relationship app than a contacts management app. Like FullContact, Cloze starts by asking you to connect various accounts, and then it pulls together everything you have.</p>

                                                                                                                                            <img src="/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0124-0119/147353-1-eng-US/f0124-012.jpg" width="553" height="553"  style="border: 0px  ;" alt="f0124-01" title="f0124-01" />

    </div><p>Its signature feature, however, is that Cloze connects with social media accounts too, giving you more insight into what your contacts are doing, not just how to get in touch with them. In analyzing not just your contacts but the interaction you have with them and frequency of those interactions, Cloze identifies people who should be most important to you, at least from a getting-ahead perspective.</p>
<p>A big problem with both Cloze and FullContact is that you get only so much out of them before you have to pay a hefty subscription fee—$159 and $99 per year, respectively.</p>
<h3><b>TWO FREE STAPLES</b></h3><p>As I continued my search for a way to merge, organize, and back up my contacts list, I found myself returning to two staples: Google Contacts and Apple Contacts. Both store their data in the cloud, and both are easy to restore on an iPhone or Android phone. They’re free, and they both have tools for pulling in information from other sources and de-duping your list. Unfortunately, the de-duping feature is a huge disappointment with both apps.</p>

    </div><p>Google Contacts was recently updated to have a different look and some new features, but it was a little light on the number of services it could connect with to import contacts automatically. And to import contacts manually, you have to switch back to the old version of the app, as the new one can’t do it yet.</p>
<p>Apple Contacts, in the end, has become my top choice. It connects to many more services than I had realized, including AOL, Facebook, Google, LinkedIn, Microsoft Exchange, Yahoo, and any service that can generate a CardDAV or LDAP file.</p>
<p>I’m sure this solution is a disappointment to Android users, and that’s not lost on me. I have an Android device and am still trying to decide on the best method for making my iCloud contacts accessible there. Another problem is that, as mentioned, the de-duping feature is terrible and missed dozens of entries that should have been merged in my testing. I ended up spending an hour scrolling through my contacts list to clean it up.</p>
<p class="pullQuote"><b>Ideally, I want one list of contacts built by merging contacts apps and databases that I already keep.</b></p>
<h3><b>WHAT’S THE BEST CONTACTS APP?</b></h3><p>In an ideal world, I want one list of contacts built by merging other contacts apps and databases that I already keep (Gmail, Facebook, Apple Contacts, Outlook, and so on). And I absolutely want the ability to access that list from any device, which means the data must be saved in the cloud.</p>
<p>I also want the ability to tell the app to disregard or hide contact cards, en masse, that are missing key information that I choose: For example, if I have an email address saved as a contact but no name or other information attached to it, get rid of it!</p>
<p>It would also be helpful if people could and would update their information on file from time to time. While some companies have tried to build this feature into their apps, it never pans out, for a number of reasons. So for now, the best method of keeping an address book up to date is to merge several sources into one and save it to the cloud.</p>
