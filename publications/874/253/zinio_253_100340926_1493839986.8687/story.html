    </div><p><b>I</b>f you’re like a lot of people, your online life is heavily tied to Google, from search and Gmail to Google Calendar and YouTube. Your PC, phone, and tablet likely connect to your Google account; maybe you even have a Pixel device.</p>
<p>How can you keep all of this information in check so no one else can access it? Google aims to help with its Security Checkup, a site that reviews your settings so you’re the only one who can view your Google account. Here’s how it works.</p>
<p>First, navigate to <a href="http://https://myaccount.google.com/secureaccount" target="_self">https://myaccount.google.com/secureaccount</a>, which should bring you to the Google Security Checkup page. You’ll see four different sections to check, each one devoted to a specific area.</p>

    </div><p><b>Next, review the section to “Check your recovery information.” Here you’ll find a recovery phone number and email, in case you forget your Google password or suspect suspicious activity with your Google account. You may also see a security question.</b></p>
<p>Make sure the phone number and email address are both enabled and correct. (You can remove your security question, if you still have one, since Google no longer supports this method of recovering your account.) When you’re finished with this section, click on the Done button.</p>

<p>You can click on the down arrow next to each device to retrieve further details.</p>
<p>If you suspect someone else may have accessed your Google account using a specific device, click on the “Something looks wrong” button. Google prompts you to change your password so no one else can tap into your account. Once all the information looks valid, click on the “Looks good” button.</p>

    </div><p><b>At the third section, “Disable access for less secure apps,” you can review the access that apps have to your Google Apps account.</b></p>
<p>The concern here is that some of these apps may use less secure methods to gain such access. Here you have three options: You can turn off access for less secure apps; you can turn on access for less secure apps and take your chances; or you can turn off access for less secure apps and try to find more secure apps as replacements.</p>
<p>You’ll want to be careful and do some testing here, though. Turning off access for less secure apps will prevent you from using your Gmail account with certain email clients.</p>

<p>Review each item to make sure you’re comfortable with each one having access to your account. You can click on the down arrow next to each item to view more detailed information. If you spot an item you’d like to cut off, just click on the Remove button. When finished, click on the Done button to complete this section and your Google Privacy Checkup.</p>
