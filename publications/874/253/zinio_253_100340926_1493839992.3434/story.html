    </div><p><b>W</b>indows has long offered a screen and text-to-speech reader called Narrator, which lets you hear every action you take in Windows spoken aloud. Narrator can also read aloud to you any text in a document or other file. It’s designed for the visually impaired, but of course, it can be used by anyone. Let’s see how it works in Windows 10.</p>

<p><b>Start Narrator automatically:</b> Narrator comes to life as soon as you launch Windows.</p>
<p><b>Choose a voice:</b> This allows you to select a voice to narrate (Microsoft offers several options) and alter the speed and pitch of that voice.</p>
<p><b>Intonation pauses:</b> Enabling this causes the voice to rise and fall when appropriate, making it sound more realistic.</p>
<p><b>Sounds you hear:</b> The options in this section determine whether you’ll hear hints for controls and buttons and hear characters and words you type. You can also set the volume of other apps to become lower when Narrator is on and play extra sounds when you perform certain actions on the screen.</p>
<p><b>Cursor and keys:</b> In this section, you can choose to highlight the cursor, have the insertion point follow Narrator, and activate keys on the touch keyboard when you lift your finger.</p>
