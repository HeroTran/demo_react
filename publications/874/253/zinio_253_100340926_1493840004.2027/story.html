    </div><p><b>S</b>pring is in the air, but gunk is in your gadgets: The smudges and crumbs you can see and the creepy-crawly bacteria that you can’t. Studies show that infection-causing E coli and Staphylococcus aureus, fecal matter (yep), and just plain dirt are hanging out on your tech.</p>
<p>This information might make you want to dunk everything into a vat of bleach, but that wouldn’t be the best thing for you or your devices. Instead, grab some microfiber cloths, Q-tips, distilled water, isopropyl alcohol, and dish soap, and read our guide to getting your gadgets to gleam.</p>
<p>Note: Before you clean anything, unplug it or turn it off.</p>
<h3><b>SMARTPHONE AND TABLET</b></h3><p>Protest if you will, but you’ve probably used your smartphone or tablet in less-than-sanitary places (we are talking about the bathroom). You wash your hands, but then you pick up your phone or tablet—and all the germs that have now attached themselves to it. It’s a gross fact that phones tend to have 10 times the bacteria that toilet seats do.</p>
<p>To scrub a phone or tablet that does not have a screen protector, you have to take extra care, since it might have an oleophobic (fingerprint-resistant) coating that could come off. The gentlest way to clean it is to take distilled water and a microfiber cloth to wipe down the phone. Use Q-tips to clean around crevices.</p>
<p>If your device has a screen protector—tempered glass or just thin plastic—get some isopropyl alcohol, distilled water, a spray bottle, and a microfiber cloth. Pour one part alcohol and one part water into the spray bottle, and then spritz a lint-free cloth with the solution, and wipe down the phone.</p>
<p>To keep your phone or tablet clean on a regular basis, keep some wipes (such as Wireless Wipes) handy, and swab it down daily. If you want to be fancy, then carry Well-Kept Screen-Cleansing Towelettes with you and use those. They come in small patterned packages that fit neatly into pants pockets or purses.</p>

    </div><h3><b>LAPTOP</b></h3><p>Because your laptop travels, it has plenty of opportunity to pick up unsavory hitchhikers. Turn it upside down and (gently) shake out the keyboard to rid your laptop of the biggest and most obvious invaders: dirt and crumbs. Then grab a can of compressed air duster and blast it.</p>
<p>Next, make sure your laptop is not only unplugged but that the battery is removed. Lightly dampen a microfiber cleaning cloth and go over all the plastic or metal surfaces.</p>
<p>To clean an LCD screen, use a product made for the job, such as EcoMoist Natural Screen Cleaner, along with a lint-free cloth to prevent those streaks that other cleaners can leave. For touch screens, use water or eyeglass cleaner.</p>
<h3><b>DESKTOP</b></h3><p>Your computer monitor might be your window to the world, but it’s not an actual window—so no Windex. Instead, use a soft cloth dampened with distilled water or the same display cleaner you’d use on a laptop for an LCD screen. Clean a touch screen with a lint-free cloth; if there are smudges, use only water or eyeglass cleaner to remove them.</p>
<p>As for the plastic parts that surround the screen, go ahead and spritz some window cleaner on them, or just use water. The same goes for your tower: Go over all the surfaces with a cloth and either water, general-purpose cleaner, or a mix that’s half isopropyl alcohol and half water.</p>

    </div><p>Chances are you’ve picked up the nasty habit of eating over your keyboard, and in turn, your keyboard has picked up some crumbs. Shake your keyboard out over a trash can and then grab a can of compressed air and get rid of the ones that lurk under the keys. Then get a damp cloth and go over the keys. Use a Q-tip to get inside the crevices. If your keyboard is particularly dirty, mix up a solution of one part isopropyl alcohol to one part water and use it with the cloth and Q-tips.</p>

    </div><p>Your mouse spends the day skittering across your desk, and it can track plenty of dirt. Use the same half-alcohol, half-water solution on a Q-tip, and run it over the feet of the mouse and through any cracks and crevices. Then take a cloth dipped in the solution and go over the body of the mouse. Don’t skip the cord.</p>
<h3><b>FITNESS TRACKERS AND SMARTWATCHES</b></h3><p>Your fitness tracker—and maybe your smartwatch—is there to make you sweat, but that means it gets sweaty along with you. The good news is that both can stand up to light moisture. Clean the face with a bit of water and a lint-free cloth.</p>
<p>Before you clean any band, remove it from your tracker or watch. For bands made of rubber (silicone, elastomer, and the like), rinse them with water or wipe them down with a small amount of rubbing alcohol. When you’re wearing moisturizing or sunscreen lotion with your band, then use a gentle skin cleanser like Cetaphil on it. If marks remain, try removing them with a rubber eraser.</p>
<p class="pullQuote"><b>Your computer monitor might be your window to the world, but it’s not an actual window—so no Windex.</b></p>
<p>Should that fail, mix one part baking soda to one part water to make a paste, and then rub that into the band and wipe off with a wet cloth. And if the band is still stained, you can try a Mr. Clean Magic Eraser. But be warned: The “magic” in the Magic Eraser is that it removes layers of the substance you’re cleaning, so essentially, you’re sandpapering the band.</p>
<p>Metal bands should be wiped with a lint-free cloth, and if necessary, you can involve a small bit of water. If you have a stainless-steel band that’s become discolored, use a tiny bit of a stainless-steel polish, but make sure to thoroughly rinse it off so you don’t transfer the chemicals to your skin when you put the band back on. For discolored silver-plated bands, use a silver-cleaning cloth sparingly (plating flakes off easily).</p>
<p>Leather bands can be wiped down with water and a lint-free cloth. The same goes for nylon bands, but those can smell, because they are especially prone to picking up sweat. If this happens or if the band is stained, mix a tiny amount of dish detergent and water to wipe it down, then follow with plain water.</p>
<p>Fitbit recommends cleaning the charging contacts on its line of trackers with a toothpick or a toothbrush dipped in rubbing alcohol. Dry the contacts with a lint-free cloth after.</p>
