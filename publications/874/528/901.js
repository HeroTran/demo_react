This is an interesting formulation. I spend a lot of time telling people what we stand for and rallying the staff around our cause. I also use every opportunity to present our incredibly useful, positive, and proactive mission statement. In fact, let’s review it quickly:</p>\n<p><i><a href=\"http://PCMag.com\" target=\"_self\">PCMag.com</a> is a leading authority on technology, delivering Labs-based, independent reviews of the latest products and services. Our expert industry analysis and practical solutions help you make better buying decisions and get more from technology</i>.</p>\n<p>But I don’t often think about what we are against. That’s a mistake: Some enemies are worth having, and some battles reveal who you really are. I am not talking about the current political landscape, where we’ve refined the art of talking past one another. We should be able to debate public policy with respect, comity, and common purpose. I’m drawing lines as editor, a publisher, and a business. I’m talking about PCMag picking the right fights. So let’s get ready to rumble!</p>\n<h3><b>BRAND SPIN</b></h3><p>I get the purpose of advertising—and our business depends on it—but I’m amazed at how different the products you see in advertisements are from those same products in the real world. Setting aside the feel-good, straight-up brand building, a lot of products just don’t work they way they do in commercials. Screens are Photoshopped in, animations replace interfaces, and features are invented. Vendors also push out an amazing amount of content every day across an array of channels. With some exceptions, most of it is useless at best and at worst, deceptive.</p>\n<h3><b>PAYOLA</b></h3><p>The FTC is doing its best to crack down on bloggers who accept gifts, payments, and other incentives to write about products, but most payola goes unnoticed. Mediakix recently found that 93 percent of the top celebrity Instagrammers did not even disclose their sponsored links. Interestingly, there are actually fewer restrictions on professional journalists. But PCMag writers don’t get paid by vendors, they don’t keep products they test, and they can’t even own individual tech stocks (mutual funds are OK).</p>\n<h3><b>FANBOYS</b></h3><p>Passion is a good thing, and we welcome technology enthusiasts. That said, slamming the iPhone because you’re an Android fanboy makes no sense. The same goes for every platform out there. There is good traffic to be had stoking these flame wars and spreading random incendiary stories, but it ultimately doesn’t help users make buying decisions and get more from technology. Let’s argue about tech, but let’s use facts.</p>\n<h3><b>HACK JOURNALISM</b></h3><p>Journalists don’t get a pass here, either. Plenty of professional writers publish before checking their facts or even pretending to offer facts. There’s a place for opinions in tech publishing, but too many writers pass their biases off as news. There’s nothing wrong with a hot take, but the vast majority of PCMag’s resources go into testing products in our Lab, collecting data, and helping users get more from their technology.</p>\n<p>I don’t know if these are all fights we can win, but I’m stepping into the ring. My first punch will be this month’s cover story, “Fastest Mobile Networks 2017.” I think it is a haymaker (but not a comeback—this is our eighth year doing the story.) Organized by Lead Mobile Analyst Sascha Segan, PCMag editors drove through and between more than 30 cities over three weeks, testing all four major carriers’ performance. They used identically configured Samsung Galaxy S8 phones and custom benchmarking software to measure download speeds, upload speeds, and overall reliability.</p>\n<p>“Fastest Mobile Networks 2017” is as good a snapshot as you can get of the wireless networks in the U.S. right now. If you’ve wanted to find out which is the fastest carrier in your home town, now you can. And our results are a lot more trustworthy than the ads you see on TV or the endorsements you see in your Facebook feed.</p>\n<p>If you agree, share the article with a friend. Even better, buy them a subscription to our ad-free Digital Edition. That way you can join the fight, too.</p>\n<p>Is there a fight you think we should be taking up?

I work with Apple and Surface due to my job, but I use my Surface more and more. I wanted to upgrade my Air to something higher-performing with USB-C and USB 3.x, but Apple just seems to be out of touch with what their customers want in a lightweight, high-performance laptop. I get not using the latest Intel chips (last year) due to production delays, but will they recover this year? I can’t see replacing hundreds of dollars of perfectly valid USB 3.x devices because of a “fashion statement,” either.

He got his start in computing when he wrote a BASIC program for a Radio Shack TRS-80.</b></p>\n<p><b>A</b>pple is slowly coming around to the realization that touch screens work on laptops. With iOS 11, its touch-screen laptop wannabe—the iPad Pro—will get not only file folders, complete with drag and drop, but also a macOS-style Dock, Apple’s less-functional response to the Windows Taskbar.</p>\n<p>But these positive moves don’t go far enough. The most common way to use an iPad Pro—in fact, the only way I’ve seen them used—is with the Smart Keyboard, which adds another $159 to $169 to the tablet’s already-laptop-level price of $649 to $1,229. If you’re using a keyboard, a mouse might seem like second nature, but the iPad Pro doesn’t support them.</p>\n<p>The other big lacuna for those using iPad Pros as laptops concerns windowing. Apple has nudged the iPad Pro’s windowing forward, but it’s still limited to a grand total of two. And let’s not even get started with the abundant multiple virtual desktops Mac users (and more recently, Windows 10 user) adore. Touch-screen laptops like the Surface Book even offer touch gestures that let you switch among running apps and between virtual desktops.</p>\n<p>Dragging files onto an email to create an attachment is cool, but you’ve been able to do that on the Surface or any PC with a touch screen for a while. In fact, none of the iOS 11 improvements for iPad Pro users represent things you can’t already do on a Windows tablet. And with those, you can use a mouse and have lots of windows and virtual desktops. Then there’s the issue of an OS that uses mobile device app icons on a nearly 13-inch screen, which would be fine if you could use a mouse to open them.</p>\n<p>Don’t get me wrong. I’m a believer that all screens should be touch screens. I love being able to poke the occasional OK button and swipe through photos and adjustment sliders, even on my 23-inch all-in-one PC screen. I disagree strongly with Apple spokespeople who contend that touch on a laptop is absurd and will cause your arm to fall off after a day’s use. That said, I like having the option to switch to a mouse. (Note that I’m not talking about pen or pencil input here, which I applaud on both the iPad Pro and the Surface Pro. It’s just not something in my wheelhouse when it comes to productivity computing.)</p>\n<p>The iPad is an awesome device. It’s light, fast, reliable, and offers every kind of useful and fun app you can think of. I use one nearly every day—as a tablet. For any kind of productive activity, I need a real computer. And with no mouse, no more than two Windows open, and an interface that’s first and foremost tailored to smartphone and tablet usage, iOS 11 doesn’t fill that bill.</p>\n<p><b><a href=\"mailto:michael_muchmore@pcmag.com\" target=\"_self\">michael_muchmore@pcmag.com</a></b></p>\n<p><b>@mikemuch</b></p>\n","layout":{},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":0,"link_source":"","competition":[],"flatplan_title":"","notes":"","gutter_credit":"","other":"","image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1498510434.6154","name":"f0021-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0021-0124/156395-1-eng-US/f0021-012.jpg?t=default_ipad_portrait&ext/f0021-012_default_ipad_portrait.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"768","height":"733","legacy_id":"13221","is_default":true},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1498510434.6154","name":"f0021-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0021-0124/156395-1-eng-US/f0021-012.jpg?t=default_ipad_landscape&ext/f0021-012_default_ipad_landscape.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"804","height":"768","legacy_id":"13221","is_default":false}],"url_alias":"http://pcmagazine-us.audiencemedia.com","type":"story","order":"6","folio_number":"21","folio_numbers":"21,22","pdf_page_index":"21","thumbnail":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0021-0124/156395-1-eng-US/f0021-012.jpg?t=tablet_story_thumbnail&ext/f0021-012_tablet_story_thumbnail.jpg","color":"FFFFFF","real_id":"13220","main_section_id":"901","ads":[]},{"id":"zinio_528_100340926_1498510435.9102","title":"Who Do You Trust More With Your Safety: Google or Ford?","sub_title":"","author":[{"id":"0","name":"","email":"noreply@audiencemedia.com","is_default":false}],"tag":"","strap_line":"Doug NewcombCOMMENTARY","intro":"","body":"\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0023-0124/156424-1-eng-US/f0023-012.jpg\" width=\"347\" height=\"338\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0023-01\" title=\"f0023-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p><b>Car tech expert Doug Newcomb has written for Popular Mechanics, Road &amp; Track, and other publications, and is the author of Car Audio for Dummies.</b></p>\n<p><b>A</b> decade ago, it would have been unimaginable that a tech company like Google could successfully challenge automakers, that Tesla would be worth more than Ford, or that ridesharing firms would be major players in personal transportation.</p>\n<p>Fully autonomous vehicles (AVs) are expected to massively disrupt the car industry, but who will win the hearts and minds of consumers and the inevitable self-driving car war: automakers, tech giants, or ridesharing companies? It’s “a new battleground,” according to Bob Pishue, a senior economist at Inrix.</p>\n<p>In a recent survey, Inrix polled about 5,000 people from five countries who had purchased a new vehicle in the last four years. Respondents were asked which kind of company they would trust most to build an AV: traditional automakers (such as BMW and General Motors), established tech giants (such as Apple and Google), newer carmakers (such as Tesla and Fisker Motors), ridesharing companies (such as Uber and Lyft), trust all equally, or none of the above.</p>\n<p>The level of trust varied by region. For example, respondents in the U.S. were slightly more trusting in tech powerhouses such as Google and Apple than automakers to build AVs (27 percent versus 23 percent, respectively).</p>\n<p>This outlook shifts significantly in Germany, where nearly three times as many respondents trust traditional car makers most to build AVs. But in all the countries surveyed (France, Italy, and the U.K. were also included), fewer than 4 percent of respondents had confidence that ridesharing companies will get robo-rides right.</p>\n<p>Despite Americans’ marginally higher faith in tech providers over automakers, the survey found that car companies have a distinct advantage in several respects. “With unknown and potentially unproven technology such as autonomous driving, consumers may default strongly to trusted brands such as the traditional car manufacturers,” Inrix stated. “It will be important for car manufacturers to demonstrate that they can develop successful high-tech products.”</p>\n<p>My cynical side says, good luck with that, since automakers have had a difficult time successfully integrating smartphone interfaces into cars, allowing Apple CarPlay and Google Android Auto to gain traction.</p>\n<p>But building a smartphone interface—or a smartphone—is nowhere near as complex as manufacturing a car, and this is where tech companies could falter and consumer confidence waver. “A problem that new entrants like Google, Apple, and Uber may face in convincing consumers to use AVs they manufacture is that they have no experience or familiarity of these brands in this space,” Inrix stated.</p>\n<p>As car owners become more familiar with semi-autonomous driving technologies such as Volvo’s Pilot Assist, this could help automakers keep consumers in the fold in a future of autonomous driving. The survey also says that “familiarity with these emerging technologies and their benefits will be central to winning customers, especially early adopters of AVs.”</p>\n<p class=\"pullQuote\"><b>History hasn’t been kind to incumbents in the tech space and is littered with once- prominent pioneering brands.</b></p>\n<p>While it’s inconceivable that some automakers could be sidelined within a decade, history hasn’t been kind to incumbents in the tech space and is littered with once-prominent pioneering brands such as Kodak, Atari, and Palm. Car companies at least have a potential head start in the AV race.</p>\n<p><b><a href=\"mailto:doug_newcomb@pcmag.com\" target=\"_self\">doug_newcomb@pcmag.com</a></b></p>\n<p><b>@dougnewcomb</b></p>\n","layout":{},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":0,"link_source":"","competition":[],"flatplan_title":"","notes":"","gutter_credit":"","other":"","image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1498510436.0276","name":"f0023-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0023-0124/156424-1-eng-US/f0023-012.jpg?t=default_ipad_portrait&ext/f0023-012_default_ipad_portrait.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"768","height":"748","legacy_id":"13224","is_default":true},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1498510436.0276","name":"f0023-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0023-0124/156424-1-eng-US/f0023-012.jpg?t=default_ipad_landscape&ext/f0023-012_default_ipad_landscape.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"788","height":"768","legacy_id":"13224","is_default":false}],"url_alias":"http://pcmagazine-us.audiencemedia.com","type":"story","order":"7","folio_number":"23","folio_numbers":"23,24,25","pdf_page_index":"23","thumbnail":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0023-0124/156424-1-eng-US/f0023-012.jpg?t=tablet_story_thumbnail&ext/f0023-012_tablet_story_thumbnail.jpg","color":"FFFFFF","real_id":"13223","main_section_id":"901","ads":[]},{"id":"zinio_528_100340926_1498510437.8657","title":"With HomePod, Apple Just Wants to Shake Things Up (for Now)","sub_title":"","author":[{"id":"0","name":"","email":"noreply@audiencemedia.com","is_default":false}],"tag":"","strap_line":"Sascha SeganCOMMENTARY","intro":"","body":"\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0026-0120/156453-1-eng-US/f0026-012.jpg\" width=\"355\" height=\"347\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0026-01\" title=\"f0026-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p><b>Sascha Segan is the lead mobile analyst for PC Magazine. His commentary has also appeared on Fox News, CNBC, CNN, and various radio stations and newspapers</b></p>\n<p>Apple’s HomePod speaker is a depth charge dropped into the ocean where Google Home and Amazon Echo sail. At $349, it’s not going to dominate the voice assistant world. But for Apple to achieve its goals, the HomePod just has to keep the waters rough enough to make its competitors seasick.</p>\n<p>There are a bunch of weird things about Apple’s HomePod announcement. First, Apple doesn’t like to announce products six months in advance. And while the iPhone and iPad are expensive, they’re not double the prices of rivals. The HomePod is also being sold as a music device above all else rather than virtual assistant.</p>\n<p>One interpretation is that Apple isn’t going after competing voice assistants but the midrange, wireless multi-room speaker market—the domain of companies including Sonos, Bose, and Logitech. Yes, those companies have $200 options, but the Sonos Play:3 costs $299, and the Bose SoundTouch 20 costs $350. Those companies have been slow to adopt the kinds of flexible voice capabilities we’ve seen on Echo and Google Home, and they tend to appeal to a higher-end consumer who thinks the Amazon and Google products look and sound cheap.</p>\n<p>But I think Apple’s strategy is a little trickier than that. The midrange speaker market is in fact ripe for disruption, and I think Apple’s correct to assume that people who have expensive speakers probably also have an iPhone. But by announcing the HomePod six months in advance, Apple’s also trying to draw developer attention away from Alexa and Google Home, making sure that it’s in second, not third place, in the eventual war of the voice assistants.</p>\n<p>Second place is a very comfortable place for Apple, because it’s focused on profit share rather than market share. In a battle between Apple and Amazon, it’s easy enough to see a repeat of the iOS/Android war, where Echo speakers eat up the bottom end of the market while Apple reaps profits at the top. Amazon actually wouldn’t mind this, as (like Google with Android, but not like Android phone makers) its business isn’t dependent on making a profit from hardware.</p>\n<h3><b>DEVELOPERS CAN HANDLE ONLY TWO PLATFORMS</b></h3><p>Platforms need developers, and we’ve seen over and over that the tech world is capable of supporting two platforms in most areas.</p>\n<p>On the desktop, it’s Mac and Windows, not Linux.</p>\n<p>On phones, it’s Apple and Android, not BlackBerry 10 or Windows Phone. On high-end tablets, increasingly, it’s Windows and iOS, with Android shunted down to the low end. Sure, the third platform often manages to hang on as a niche, but the two major ones dominate the market. Developers just don’t seem to have the resources to split their attention more broadly.</p>\n<p>Right now there are three players in voice assistants: Apple, Google, and Amazon. Apple is coming late to the game, but it understands the value of not being third. And as it implied by focusing on music in its presentation, SiriKit is way behind the competition in attracting developers right now.</p>\n<p>Apple needs to get SiriKit into the conversation and to make sure Google and Amazon don’t lock down voice-assistant developers, which could definitely happen in the next six months. By announcing the HomePod now, Apple throws a bit of confusion into that community; should developers keep their powder dry?</p>\n<p>Google is likely to suffer more than Amazon from this, because Amazon has a lot of third-party partners and an already vibrant developer community. Look at the list of Alexa skills versus Google Home voice actions: Google is just getting started here. Google’s speaker also sounds better—and costs more—than Amazon’s hot-selling Echo Dot, putting it in a little more danger from Apple’s higher-end product.</p>\n<p>This doesn’t mean that Apple’s HomePod is going to be a best-seller. Sure, it could be the next Apple Hi-Fi, an expensive audio accessory that ends up being overlooked for better third-party products. But it keeps the waters roiled and keeps the Google-Amazon duopoly from fixing in place. When developers can only focus on two platforms, that means at least Apple has a chance.</p>\n<p><b><a href=\"mailto:sascha_segan@pcmag.com\" target=\"_self\">sascha_segan@pcmag.com</a></b></p>\n<p><b>@saschasegan</b></p>\n","layout":{},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":0,"link_source":"","competition":[],"flatplan_title":"","notes":"","gutter_credit":"","other":"","image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1498510437.9871","name":"f0026-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0026-0120/156453-1-eng-US/f0026-012.jpg?t=default_ipad_portrait&ext/f0026-012_default_ipad_portrait.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"768","height":"751","legacy_id":"13227","is_default":true},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1498510437.9871","name":"f0026-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0026-0120/156453-1-eng-US/f0026-012.jpg?t=default_ipad_landscape&ext/f0026-012_default_ipad_landscape.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"786","height":"768","legacy_id":"13227","is_default":false}],"url_alias":"http://pcmagazine-us.audiencemedia.com","type":"story","order":"8","folio_number":"26","folio_numbers":"26,27,28","pdf_page_index":"26","thumbnail":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0026-0120/156453-1-eng-US/f0026-012.jpg?t=tablet_story_thumbnail&ext/f0026-012_tablet_story_thumbnail.jpg","color":"FFFFFF","real_id":"13226","main_section_id":"901","ads":[]},{"id":"zinio_528_100340926_1498510603.8286","title":"Forget Man vs. Machine: It’s Time for Computer vs. Computer","sub_title":"","author":[{"id":"0","name":"JOHN C.

IBM’s Deep Blue beat Garry Kasparov, and Watson prevailed on <i>Jeopardy!</i> It’s time we stopped pitting computers against people; there’s no point.</p>\n<p>It’s great that one computer can house the entire Library of Congress. But until an artificial intelligence system can synthesize an actual new idea from the knowledge contained in those books, these machines are still nothing more than grandiose, soulless adding machines.</p>\n<p>Now that doesn’t mean the game-playing machines can’t provide interesting entertainment, especially if you rethink playing the games and add some new twists. We already have computer programs that can play bridge, for example. Step it up by having them face off against bridge superfans Bill Gates and Warren Buffett. This twosome would love to take on this challenge and might even finance the whole thing. Bridge-playing computers win a lot of championships and would probably beat Gates and Buffett. Let’s find out.</p>\n<p>Computer versus man chess matches go back to the 1950s. It has improved the programs over time, but how about someone laying down a cool $1 million and having computers play against computers? Anyone who likes chess would love to see how new strategies might evolve.</p>\n<p>Man versus machine is fun but futile and proves nothing. There have been computer versus computer showdowns, but not with big stakes; not enough to encourage new developments. How about machine versus machine in other arenas? If Watson is so smart, could it play the game of go against the Google machine? I’d love to see how that showdown goes. How about Watson versus Deep Blue?</p>\n<p>The games would be played at breakneck speed; thousands might be played in a few minutes and end up in all stalemates. Final matches between two fabulous chess-playing machines might run for months before a victor appeared. Then what would happen if you had to win two out of three? I think a lot of people would find this a lot more interesting than computers versus humans, over and over.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0139-0114/157550-1-eng-US/f0139-012.jpg\" width=\"582\" height=\"278\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0139-01\" title=\"f0139-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p><b><a href=\"mailto:john_dvorak@pcmag.com\" target=\"_self\">john_dvorak@pcmag.com</a></b></p>\n<p><b>@ THErealDVORAK</b></p>\n","layout":{},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":0,"link_source":"","competition":[],"flatplan_title":"","notes":"","gutter_credit":"","other":"","image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1498510604.9246","name":"f0138-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0138-0115/157557-1-eng-US/f0138-012.jpg?t=default_ipad_portrait&ext/f0138-012_default_ipad_portrait.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"768","height":"747","legacy_id":"13371","is_default":true},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1498510604.9246","name":"f0138-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0138-0115/157557-1-eng-US/f0138-012.jpg?t=default_ipad_landscape&ext/f0138-012_default_ipad_landscape.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"790","height":"768","legacy_id":"13371","is_default":false}],"related_objects":{"image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_1_1498510603.9449","name":"f0139-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0139-0114/157550-1-eng-US/f0139-012.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"582","height":"278","legacy_id":"13370"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_1_1498510603.9449","name":"f0139-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0139-0114/157550-1-eng-US/f0139-012.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"582","height":"278","legacy_id":"13370"}]},"url_alias":"http://pcmagazine-us.audiencemedia.com","type":"story","order":"20","folio_number":"138","folio_numbers":"138,139","pdf_page_index":"138","thumbnail":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0138-0115/157557-1-eng-US/f0138-012.jpg?t=tablet_story_thumbnail&ext/f0138-012_tablet_story_thumbnail.jpg","color":"FFFFFF","real_id":"13369","main_section_id":"901","ads":[]}],"type":null,"ads":[]}}
