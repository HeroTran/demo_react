The company has been showing off flexible AMOLED panels for years, but now it’s demoing something new: stretchable OLEDs. In addition to bending and flexing, you can also change the shape and size of these panels without distorting the image.</p>\n<p>Samsung unveiled the prototype display at Display Week 2017 in Los Angeles. The OLED panel is 9.1 inches, which is in the size range for a tablet. The larger size also helps show off the impressive stretching capabilities. What sets this apart from other flexible displays shown in the past is that it can be deformed in two directions: It can bend but also become convex or concave.</p>\n<p>This panel is elastic enough to recover from repeated stretching, but it’s important to remember that this is a demo. A flexible screen you sell to people needs to remain elastic for years, but this prototype needs to last only through a week-long conference. In fact, most of the “flexible” display technology we have now has only gone toward forming curved screens that don’t bend after manufacturing.</p>\n<p>Samsung currently sells a number of phones with curved displays, including the Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus. The curved variants of past phones sold better than the flat ones, so Samsung isn’t even making a flat version of the GS8. Maybe in the future you’ll be able to get a Galaxy smartphone that can stretch, too.</p>\n<p>Samsung’s prototype has one interesting bonus that current curved and flexible panels don’t have — it can adjust the image to eliminate distortion. This only works for up to 12mm (about half an inch) of stretching, after which the image will no longer look “flat.” Samsung would not comment on how far the display was capable of stretching, but presumably it’s more than 12mm.</p>\n<p>The hope is that stretchable OLEDs could become useful in devices where screens need to be compact or unusual shapes—for example, in wearables and IoT products. You could also alter interfaces when a display stretches — like 3D Touch that’s actually 3D. There are also plentiful gaming applications. Just bear in mind that it took several years for curved displays to move from trade show demo to real product, and this technology will probably take even longer.</p>\n","layout":{"landscape":{"id":"am-rs-landscape-1","link":"article_whatsnew-l.twig"},"portrait":{"id":"am-rs-portrait-1","link":"article_whatsnew.twig"}},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":0,"link_source":"","competition":[],"flatplan_title":"","notes":"","gutter_credit":"","other":"","image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1498510406.9604","name":"f0009-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0009-0120/156209-1-eng-US/f0009-012.jpg?t=story_img_size_768x0&ext/f0009-012_story_img_size_768x0.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"1600","height":"884","legacy_id":"13199","is_default":true},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1498510406.9604","name":"f0009-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0009-0120/156209-1-eng-US/f0009-012.jpg?t=story_img_size_768x0&ext/f0009-012_story_img_size_768x0.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"1600","height":"884","legacy_id":"13199","is_default":false}],"url_alias":"http://pcmagazine-us.audiencemedia.com","type":"story","order":"2","folio_number":"9","folio_numbers":"9,10","pdf_page_index":"9","thumbnail":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0009-0120/156209-1-eng-US/f0009-012.jpg?t=tablet_story_thumbnail&ext/f0009-012_tablet_story_thumbnail.jpg","color":"FFFFFF","real_id":"13198","main_section_id":"902","ads":[]},{"id":"zinio_528_100340926_1498510409.9519","title":"The Coolest Features in iOS 11","sub_title":"","author":[{"id":"0","name":"CHLOE ALBANESIUS","email":"noreply@audiencemedia.com","is_default":false}],"tag":"","strap_line":"WHAT’S NEW NOWNEWS STORY","intro":"","body":"<p class=\"byline\"><b>BY CHLOE ALBANESIUS</b></p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0011-0125/156259-1-eng-US/f0011-012.jpg\" width=\"1600\" height=\"987\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0011-01\" title=\"f0011-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p><b>A</b>pple kicked off its annual Worldwide Developers Conference in June with six key announcements: One was its newest mobile operating system, iOS 11. Craig Federighi, Apple’s senior vice president of software engineering, promised “hundreds of new features and incredible updates” for existing iOS apps. The company released a beta version of iOS 11 to developers at the conference and promised a public beta in July for those who like to tinker with new software. Everyone else will get iOS 11 in the fall, which is likely when new iPhones will be released.</p>\n<p>With hundreds of new features, not everything can be a winner. A new look for the App Store? Meh. Revamped Control Center? Better than before, but it looks a bit cramped. But several things caught our eye and will likely improve the iOS experience come September. Here are the features we’re most looking forward to trying out.</p>\n<p class=\"pullQuote\"><b>The company released a beta version of iOS 11 to developers at the conference and promised a public beta in July.</b></p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0012-0123/156252-1-eng-US/f0012-012.jpg\" width=\"920\" height=\"526\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0012-01\" title=\"f0012-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>INSTANT AR GRATIFICATION</b></h3><p><b>ARKit, a new software tool from Apple, lets developers create AR apps that will work with current iPhones.</b></p>\n<h3><b>AUGMENTED REALITY</b></h3><p>Though some of its biggest rivals have embraced virtual and augmented reality, including Microsoft’s HoloLens and Samsung’s Gear VR, Apple has mostly observed from the sidelines. Last fall, Tim Cook said AR was “incredibly interesting,” but that’s all we’ve heard from Cupertino on the matter, even as millions of Pokémon fans ran around the country last summer catching AR creatures on their iPhones.</p>\n<p>Now it appears Apple is finally ready to embrace augmented reality with new tools for software developers that will allow them to bring augmented reality apps to iPhones and iPads. Using ARKit, developers will be able to create AR apps that work with people’s existing iPhones; you won’t need a special phone to see AR tricks like you do with Google Tango. Apple just needs developers to start creating.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0013-0127/156245-1-eng-US/f0013-012.jpg\" width=\"556\" height=\"855\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0013-01\" title=\"f0013-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>APPLE PAY PERSON TO PERSON</b></h3><p>Apple Pay is cool; I’ve used it to buy shampoo at Duane Reade and perfume at Sephora. What a world. It hasn’t allowed for person-to-person money transfers a la Venmo, though. But with iOS 11, you’ll be able to send money via iMessages to friends who also have iOS devices. They can then add the payment to their Apple account, send it to someone else, or transfer it to their bank accounts. No more hunting down friends for that $20 they owe or having to (gasp!) write a check.</p>\n<h3><b>SIRI TRANSLATION</b></h3><p>Siri has a lot going for her, but she’s still a work in progress. At WWDC, Apple touted Siri’s increasing smarts, including her multilingual capabilities. In iOS 11, Siri will give Google Translate a run for its money by translating things you tell her in English into Chinese, Spanish, French, German, or Italian. Apple’s iOS 11 website notes that this feature is in beta, so be prepared for some iffy answers. If something gets lost in translation, you can always try the universal language: music. A Personal DJ feature will let you ask Siri to play something you’d like, which she’ll do based on previous music choices.</p>\n<h3><b>MULTITASKING</b></h3><p>Microsoft is going after Apple pretty aggressively with its Surface Laptop and Surface Pro devices, arguing in part that Windows is easier to use for business types. The company has a point; iOS is beautiful, and the iPad Pro is sleek, but there are some productivity hiccups.</p>\n<p>Apple wants to change that with the multitasking updates in iOS 11 for iPad.</p>\n<p>The Files app, for example, lets you “browse, search, and organize all your files in one place,” Apple says. The Dock from the Mac, meanwhile, is also coming to iPad for easy access to apps. If you opt for Slide Over or Split View, both apps will remain active. And the most noteworthy addition? Drag and drop.</p>\n<h3><b>MULTI-ROOM AUDIO</b></h3><p>Music fans who want to keep the party going from room to room will appreciate AirPlay 2, which brings HomeKit support to speakers for multi-room audio. So you can play a song on the Bang &amp; Olufsen speaker in the living room and the Bose in the kitchen. Or have a playlist play on every connected speaker you have in the home—including, presumably, Apple’s upcoming HomePod.</p>\n<h3><b>APPLE MAPS DO NOT DISTURB</b></h3><p>Apple Maps has improved since its disastrous debut, though it’s not quite as robust as Google Maps. That could change in iOS 11, which adds features including lane assist, speed limit, and a “do not disturb” mode. With “do not disturb” enabled, you won’t get any notifications or messages while the car is in motion. If someone texts you, they’ll get an auto-reply that says you’re driving and will get back to them at your destination. In an emergency, though, it has the option to break the “do not disturb.” And passengers can select “I’m not driving” so they can still peruse Instagram on the commute. Apple also promised detailed maps of hundreds of airports and shopping centers, for when you really need to track down that Shake Shack before your flight.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0014-0123/156238-1-eng-US/f0014-012.jpg\" width=\"1310\" height=\"649\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0014-01\" title=\"f0014-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>LIVE PHOTOS</b></h3><p>Apple’s Live Photos, which arrived with the iPhone 6s lineup, attaches 3-second videos to your still photos.

The last two fields are tied closely, of course, to core changes in the PC-component ecosystem. That’s why we go to Computex every year, and boy, 2017’s show delivered on that front.</p>\n<p>Computex is always a showcase for the best new PC tech coming out of Taiwan’s major PC players, as well as major core-tech anchors such as Intel and Nvidia. And Asus, Acer, MSI, and others showed off impressive new products, from budget 2-in-1s to lots of powerhouse gaming laptops. Asus in particular announced a massive collection of new devices, most of them slimmer and lighter than ever.</p>\n<p>Chip giant Intel took the wraps off what look like its most powerful consumer-accessible PC processors ever, in the Intel Core X lineup. The nine new CPUs top out with the Core i9-7980XE, an 18-core, 36-thread monster. This was an obvious answer to AMD’s impressive Ryzen CPU launch earlier in 2017, and the imminent Threadripper/X399 platform, which AMD says will include a 16-core, 32-thread CPU to arrive sometime this summer.</p>\n<p>Nvidia started off the show not by announcing new GPUs but instead revealing a more efficient “Max-Q” technology to leverage its existing “Pascal” chips for laptops. The most impressive of the new Max-Q laptops we saw at the show was the Asus ROG Zephyrus, a GTX 1080/Core i7 system that’s well under an inch thick and weighs less than 5 pounds. And while there were no new graphics chips launched at the show, we were impressed by the Zotac GeForce GTX 1080 Ti Mini, a powerhouse card that’s just over 8 inches long—and overclocked!</p>\n<p>But that’s just the crest of the Computex product wave. Here are some of the best products we saw at the show this year.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0016-0126/156316-1-eng-US/f0016-012.jpg\" width=\"817\" height=\"674\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0016-01\" title=\"f0016-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>BEST NEW GAMING LAPTOP:</b><b>Asus ROG Zephyrus</b></h3><p>There’s no denying Asus’ ROG Zephyrus has some design quirks, like its keyboard and touch-pad placement. But the company worked with Nvidia and its new Max-Q initiative to squeeze GeForce GTX 1080 graphics, a 7th Generation “Kaby Lake” processor, and a high-refresh-rate screen into a device that’s just 0.74 inch thick and 4.85 pounds. That’s impressive from an engineering standpoint alone, but we also like the way the laptop looks, with its straight lines and copper edge accents. The hinge, notably, is tied into the ventilation system, with the vents at the back opening wider when you lift the lid. This may be the most interesting new laptop we saw, period. It’s going to be expensive with a GTX 1080 at $2,699.

It’s not special because of the design, though it is quite sleek; it’s special because it’s built wholly around AMD core CPU/GPU components—and it’s not a bare-budget play but a power machine. The Inspiron 27 7000 will be available in a number of configurations around full desktop AMD Ryzen processors and Radeon RX 500 graphics, topping out at the RX 580. With an RX 580 inside, this AIO will be well capable of powering virtual-reality headsets.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0017-025/156302-1-eng-US/f0017-022.jpg\" width=\"663\" height=\"701\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0017-02\" title=\"f0017-02\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>BEST NEW GAMING DESKTOP:</b><b>Zotac Mek</b></h3><p>Look out, Tiki; look out, Predator; you’re up against a mech now. Along the same size lines as the Predator G1 or Falcon Northwest Tiki, the Zotac Mek goes for a Tron-like minimalist-cool design and leverages the company’s strong position in small video cards. Zotac has pushed out Mini versions of most of the GeForce GTX 1000-series “Pascal” cards, and the company says the Mek should debut with a GTX 1080 plus a Core i7-7700 desktop chip, quite the power pair. A 450-watt power supply and a PCI Express NVMe SSD boot drive complete the config, and it will come in black or white with LED strips down the front. Unlike many of the company’s Zbox PCs, which tend to ship bare-bones with some parts left to you to supply, these will be fully configured PCs. No pricing or availability yet, but this Mek looks ready to do some hurtin’.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0018-0128/156295-1-eng-US/f0018-012.jpg\" width=\"770\" height=\"667\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0018-01\" title=\"f0018-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>BEST NEW MAINSTREAM/BUDGET LAPTOP OR 2-IN-1:</b><b>Acer Spin 1</b></h3><p>The Spin 1 is a 2-in-1 rotating convertible that is all about the numbers: 1080p, 11.6-inch, 0.55-inch, $329. Well, it’s also about build quality. For a laptop this inexpensive, it impressed us with a nifty metal body. At a 0.55-inch thickness, this is a lean machine for such a low price, and it weighs just shy of 2.8 pounds. The 11.6-inch IPS (in-plane switching) panel provides fine viewing at any angle. The unit’s base specs are modest but in keeping with the price. Pentium or Celeron chips will be the order of the day, along with 4GB of RAM and eMMC storage (at 32GB, 64GB, or 128GB). We’d estimate the $329 config would be a 4GB/Celeron/32GB model, but we’ll have to wait and see. You also get two USB 3.0 ports, plus an HDMI out.

And the ZenBook Flip S features—surprise, surprise!—support for up to a Core i7 U-series processor. Why that matters: The chassis, Asus claims, is the thinnest of any Core-based 2-in-1. The rotating hinge on most convertible laptops of this kind make these machines thick by nature. Here, though, the laptop is just 10.9mm thick (well under half an inch!) and weighs just 2.4 pounds.
