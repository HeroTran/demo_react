The unlocked Moto Z2 Play, on the other hand, builds on a concept Motorola established last year: It has a unique design that works with Motos Mods, useful modular back panels that bring new functionality. It also has snappy performance and great battery life, and it’s compatible with all major U.S. carriers. And unlike the Z Droid, it even has a headphone jack. That makes the Z2 Play a great phone for anyone who’s sold on the modular build. Otherwise, the ZTE Axon 7 gets you a bit more power for less money.</p>\n<h3><b>Motorola Moto Z2 Play</b></h3><p>$499.00</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0029-0210/156531-1-eng-US/f0029-022.jpg\" width=\"209\" height=\"29\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0029-02\" title=\"f0029-02\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div>\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0030-0119/156524-1-eng-US/f0030-012.jpg\" width=\"1455\" height=\"809\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0030-01\" title=\"f0030-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>A SLIM, SMOOTH, FAMILIAR DESIGN</b></h3><p>Available in black, blue, gold, and gray, the Moto Z2 Play is largely the same phone as the Moto Z Droid and Play Droid in terms of design. The svelte device is ringed by a band of metal along the sides, with a set of clicky volume buttons and a ridged power button on the right. The back panel is made of matte metal and features a protruding camera bump and a row of magnetic attachment pins for Moto Mods (more on those later).</p>\n<p>Measuring 6.1 by 3.0 by 0.2 inches (HWD) and 5.1 ounces, the Z2 Play is identical to the slim Z Droid in dimensions, but it manages to include a headphone jack on the bottom. That said, it’s quite a bit bigger than the Samsung Galaxy S8 (5.9 by 2.7 by 0.3 inches, 5.5 ounces) and the LG G6 (5.9 by 2.8 by 0.3 inches, 5.8 ounces), which feature new aspect ratios to accommodate taller, thinner displays. There’s a sizable bezel above and below the display, making the Z2 Play hard to reach across with your thumb and difficult to operate with just one hand, especially when you’re using a thick Moto Mod.</p>\n<p>There’s a USB-C charging port on the bottom with the aforementioned headphone jack next to it. The top has a combined SIM/microSD card slot that worked fine with a 256GB card. The phone has a water-repellent coating to help resist splashes, but it’s not IP-rated in any way, so keep it dry when possible. If you want a waterproof handset, the Galaxy S8 is rated IP68 for water protection (and is also significantly more expensive).</p>\n<p>The phone’s 5.5-inch, 1,920-by-1,080 AMOLED display is easy on the eyes, with 401 pixels per inch. While it’s not as sharp as the Quad HD S8 (580ppi), G6 (564ppi), or Axon 7 (538ppi), it’s crisp enough that you won’t notice any pixelation. Colors are deep and saturated, and blacks are perfectly inky, only lighting up pixels as needed. Screen brightness is almost blinding at maximum, and viewing angles are excellent, so you’ll have no trouble using the phone outdoors. The phone also has a Night Display mode that automatically adjusts color temperature to warmer tones to help you sleep better at night.</p>\n<h3><b>Motorola Moto Z2 Play</b></h3><p><b>PROS Useful modular design. Current software and virtually no bloatware. Compatible with all major U.S. carriers. Long battery life.</b></p>\n<p><b>CONS Difficult to use with one hand. Tinny speaker. Slightly pricey for the specs.</b></p>\n<h3><b>EASY ON THE EYES</b></h3><p><b>The Moto Z2 Play features a 5.5-inch, 1080p AMOLED display.

These include gestures such as twisting the phone to launch the camera app, chopping it twice to trigger the flashlight, and swiping down to shrink the screen for one-handed use. The most useful feature is Split Screen mode: Holding down the Recent Apps button allows you to divide the screen and run two apps side by side.</p>\n<p>Moto Display works similar to the always-on display on the Galaxy S8 to show you notifications without you needing to press a button or unlock your phone. Instead of being continuously on, however, the screen lights up only when you reach for the phone. Simply extending a hand toward the Z2 Play will bring up the time, date, battery percentage, music controls (if music is playing), and notifications. You can set the display to fade in and out, so even when you trigger it accidentally, it won’t drain too much juice.</p>\n<p>Moto Voice lets you control the phone with voice commands. You can have the phone speak calls and texts out loud and ask questions using the trigger words “show me.” For instance, “show me the weather” will bring up the forecast, and “show me the calendar” will pull up your schedule and upcoming events. But ultimately, this doesn’t provide much functionality beyond what Google Assistant already offers, and I prefer using the latter for its deeper Google integration and AI-assisted capabilities.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0032-0113/156510-1-eng-US/f0032-012.jpg\" width=\"1442\" height=\"809\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0032-01\" title=\"f0032-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>ONLY THE APPS YOU WANT</b></h3><p><b>The phone comes running a nearly stock version of Android 7.1.1 Nougat with no bloatware.</b></p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0033-0121/156503-1-eng-US/f0033-012.jpg\" width=\"588\" height=\"681\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0033-01\" title=\"f0033-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p class=\"pullQuote\"><b>Enabling One Button Navigation lets you use the fingerprint sensor to perform various on-screen functions.</b></p>\n<p>Like the Moto G5 Plus, the Z2 Play supports One Button Navigation. Enabling it lets you use the fingerprint sensor to perform various on-screen functions. Swiping to the left takes you back, swiping right brings up recent apps, touching the sensor once unlocks the phone, touching it again lets it function as a home button, and holding it down brings up Google Assistant. This is a simple and intuitive way to interact with your phone: It also spares your thumbs from reaching around so much and frees up some screen space.</p>\n<h3><b>A TRULY MODULAR EXPERIENCE</b></h3><p>Along with its predecessors, the Z2 Play is among the few truly modular smartphones. Unlike LG, which abandoned its Friends accessories, Motorola has not only stuck with Moto Mods but has also opened the door to third parties. The sky’s the limit, which is part of what makes Moto Mods so fun and flexible. You can add such components as a wireless charging and backup battery, a projector, or just a simple, stylish back cover. The best part is that they’re perfectly streamlined: Snap on the magnetic back, and your phone instantly recognizes which Mod you’ve attached, shows you how much battery power it has, and turns the Mod on automatically.</p>\n<p>Several new Mods launched with the Z2 Play. We tested the JBL SoundBoost 2 ($79.99), a compact but powerful speaker with a kickstand, a splash-proof coating, and 10-hour battery life. There’s also the Moto TurboPower Pack ($79.99), a snap-on battery pack with a 3,490mAh cell that can add an extra day of battery life and fast charge your phone at 15W speeds. The Moto Style Shells ($39.99) offer attractive designs and add support for both Qi and PMA wireless charging standards at 10W speeds with minimal bulk, but you’ll need to buy a wireless charging pad separately.</p>\n<p>Don’t worry if you already own earlier Mods—the Z2 Play is fully compatible with them. The Moto Insta-Share Projector ($299.99) and Hasselblad True Zoom Camera ($299.99) both worked seamlessly with the phone.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0034-0110/156496-1-eng-US/f0034-012.jpg\" width=\"1310\" height=\"741\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0034-01\" title=\"f0034-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>NETWORK PERFORMANCE AND CONNECTIVITY</b></h3><p>The Z2 Play supports CDMA (850, 1900MHz), GSM (850, 900, 1800, 1900MHz), UMTS (850, 900, 1700, 1900, 2100MHz), and LTE bands (1/2/3/4/5/7/8/12/13/17/20/25/26/28/29/30/38/41/66). It’s the same set you’ll find on the G5 Plus, allowing the phone to work on all major U.S. carriers, including AT&amp;T, Sprint, T-Mobile, and Verizon. We tested it on T-Mobile in midtown Manhattan, where we recorded solid network performance with top speeds of 14.3Mbps down and an unusually high 17.6Mbps up.</p>\n<p>Other connectivity protocols include dual-band Wi-Fi (2.4GHz and 5GHz), Bluetooth 4.2, and NFC, allowing you to use Android Pay.</p>\n<p>Phone calls are decent but nothing to write home about. Transmission clarity is fine, but voices have a rasping, robotic edge. Noise cancellation is good at blotting out background sounds, and we didn’t have any trouble carrying on a conversation in a noisy environment. The earpiece is loud, which is good because it also serves as a speaker. That makes it great for phone calls, but subpar for music. Then again, you can always use the Soundboost 2 Mod.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0035-0116/156489-1-eng-US/f0035-012.jpg\" width=\"1132\" height=\"548\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0035-01\" title=\"f0035-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>FAST, LONG-LASTING POWER</b></h3><p><b>The Z2 Play comes with a Turbo Power adapter, which supports fast charging. And battery life is excellent; the phone lasted 8 hours 18 minutes in our rundown test.</b></p>\n<h3><b>PLENTY OF POWER</b></h3><p>The phone is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 626 processor clocked at 2.2GHz. It’s a solid chipset, scoring 68,040 on the AnTuTu benchmark, slightly edging out the 625-powered G5 Plus (63,845). It can’t match the powerful Snapdragon 820 processor in the Axon 7 (141,989) or the top-of-the-line Snapdragon 835 in the Galaxy S8 (158,266), but testing ran without a hitch.</p>\n<p>The combination of a lightweight Android skin and 4GB of RAM under the hood is more than enough to handle all of your multitasking needs. We were able to play demanding games like GTA: San Andreas and Injustice 2 without a single stutter.</p>\n<p>Battery life is excellent. The phone clocked 8 hours 18 minutes in our battery rundown test, in which we stream full-screen video over LTE at maximum brightness. That’s nearly an hour longer than the G5 Plus (7 hours, 35 minutes) and significantly better than the S8 (5 hours, 45 minutes). With average use, it’s more than enough juice to get you through the day. If you want even more power, the aforementioned TurboPower Pack Mod will give you a nice boost. The included Turbo Power adapter supports fast charging.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0036-0121/156482-1-eng-US/f0036-012.jpg\" width=\"1310\" height=\"713\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0036-01\" title=\"f0036-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>SOLID SHOOTING</b></h3><p>The Z2 Play has a 12-megapixel rear camera that takes crisp pictures in well-lit settings. It can’t quite match higher-end phones, but we were impressed by the accurate color reproduction and the fast-focusing laser autofocus. Shots of detailed objects such as plants and buildings showed little to no noise, and clarity was good. That said, the Z2 Play does lean heavily on post-processing, and shots taken on a cloudy day looked over-processed and a little artificial.</p>\n<p>The phone’s camera performed reasonably well in low lighting. Some pictures taken indoors were noisy, and autofocus didn’t lock on as fast, but that’s the case with most phones. We were still able to get some solid low-light shots by using manual controls to adjust exposure and shutter speed. You can also tweak white balance, ISO, and focus to improve picture quality. The Z2 Play can record 4K video at 30fps. Recordings are crisp and fairly stable. Generally, we found the phone to be a better shooter than the G5 Plus but unable to compete with the S8.</p>\n<p>The 5-megapixel front camera is also solid. Pictures are sharp and detailed, and objects in the background come across clearly. Low-light shots can be a little grainy, but there’s a dual-LED flash on the front and support for HDR, so we were usually able to take clear photos.</p>\n<h3><b>PURE ANDROID (ALMOST)</b></h3><p>The Z2 Play comes with Android 7.1.1 Nougat, the same up-to-date build you’ll find on the Google Pixel XL and essentially stock, aside from some special Motorola flavoring (the aforementioned Moto Actions, Moto Display, and Moto Voice). Motorola has a respectable track record with updates, so there’s a good chance you’ll see Android O on the Z2 Play in the near future.</p>\n<p>The phone is free from bloatware aside from two preinstalled apps from Motorola. One is the Moto app that allows you to configure gestures and voice controls. The Moto Mods app doesn’t do much aside from take you to the Motorola website; all the functionality that recognizes when a new Mod has been attached and gives you configuration options is built right into the Settings menu, so this app seems superfluous.</p>\n<p>Out of the 64GB of internal storage, the phone has 48.68GB free for use. That’s a decent amount of space, but if you need more for apps, games, or 4K video, you can always use a microSD card and format it as internal storage.</p>\n<h3><b>CONCLUSION</b></h3><p>The Moto Z2 Play is yet another solid modular phone from Motorola. On its own, it offers respectable performance, long battery life, and compatibility with all major U.S. carriers. It pulls ahead of some of the competition when you start snapping on Moto Mods, offering a unique level of flexibility you don’t get with the G6, the S8, or any other non-Motorola phone, for that matter.</p>\n<p>That said, the Z2 Play doesn’t have the fastest processor or the highest-resolution screen you’ll find in this price range. The ZTE Axon 7 may be nearly a year old, but it gets you a higher-resolution display, a more powerful processor, and consistent software updates for $100 less than the Z2 Play. If you’re willing to spend more, the Galaxy S8 is the best Android phone we’ve tested, with a sharper display and the fastest processor you can get. And if you’re looking to save money and Moto Mods aren’t of interest to you, the Moto G5 Plus remains a perfectly solid option.</p>\n<p class=\"byline\"><b>AJAY

hear it again in the U11 for Sprint, a shimmery slab of audio excellence. There’s a lot more going on with the U11, however. It’s also the first U.S. phone with always-on Alexa support, and it’s potentially Sprint’s fastest LTE phone yet. But if you’re going to pick one reason to buy it right now, it’s the sound. Otherwise, the Galaxy S8 remains a slightly more well-rounded device and our Editors’ Choice.</p>\n<h3><b>HTC U11</b></h3><p>$696.00</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0038-022/156595-1-eng-US/f0038-022.jpg\" width=\"209\" height=\"30\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0038-02\" title=\"f0038-02\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>MODELS AND DESIGN</b></h3><p>HTC offers two U11 models: one for Sprint and an unlocked model (available for $649 from <a href=\"http://HTC.com\" target=\"_self\">HTC.com</a>) that will work on the three other major U.S. carriers. We reviewed the Sprint unit. Many of the other reviews you see out there will be for the unlocked unit, which has slightly different firmware.</p>\n<p>The first thing you notice about the phone is the design. The U11 is gorgeous. It comes in black or silver, but the color you really want is the deep, automotive-paint blue. There’s a big price to pay for the baked-in, unscratchable color, though: The phone is a fingerprint magnet, and it’ll be perpetually greasy unless you go for a (clear, please) case.</p>\n<p>I’ve been very spoiled by narrow phones such as the Samsung Galaxy S8, the LG G6, and the BlackBerry KeyOne recently. At 6.07 by 2.99 by 0.31 inches and 5.96 ounces, the U11 is a standard size for a 16:9, 5.5-inch phone, but it still feels too wide in my hand. The sleek back turns slippery quickly, and especially when you’re trying to squeeze the edges of the phone, it feels like you can drop it.</p>\n<p>The 2,560-by-1,440 Super LCD 5 is visible outdoors and in and looks razor sharp. Below it is a fingerprint sensor/home button flanked by two fixed, capacitive keys. On the sides of the phone, invisible, is the innovative “squeeze” section, a pressure sensor that can launch the camera, flashlight, or any other app.</p>\n<p>The phone is IP67 water-resistant, which means it can be dunked in up to three feet of water for 30 minutes. HTC’s previous generations of phones weren’t water-resistant, but competing flagships from other manufacturers tend to be now.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0039-0115/156588-1-eng-US/f0039-012.jpg\" width=\"1600\" height=\"771\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0039-01\" title=\"f0039-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>HTC U11</b></h3><p><b>PROS Excellent audio quality. Useful squeeze sensor. Gigabit LTE. Fast processor. Alexa compatible.</b></p>\n<p><b>CONS Camera doesn’t measure up to its marketing. No headphone jack. Back panel attracts fingerprints.</b></p>\n<h3><b>SHIMMERY AND GORGEOUS</b></h3><p><b>The U11 comes in black or silver, but the color you really want is the deep, automotive-paint blue.</b></p>\n<p class=\"pullQuote\"><b>You’ll find a dramatic improvement in Sprint coverage in weak signal situations when you compare the U11 with older phones.</b></p>\n<h3><b>NETWORKING AND BATTERY</b></h3><p>The U11 is billed as Sprint’s first gigabit LTE phone. It’s the first phone with 4x4 MIMO on Sprint’s Band 41, completing the trio of technologies that should allow it to get the fastest possible speeds on Sprint’s network. We tested it against a Samsung Galaxy S8 using our field test software, though, and didn’t see the difference, at least not yet. Comparing three locations with good Sprint signal in Manhattan, we got an average of 29.2Mbps down on the S8 as compared with 23.6Mbps on the U11.</p>\n<p>That said, you’ll find a dramatic improvement in Sprint coverage in weak signal situations when you compare the U11 with older phones. The U11, like the Galaxy S8 and LG G6, has HPUE (high performance user equipment), which we’ve seen improve Sprint signal in several different tests.</p>\n<p>Performance on other U.S. carriers with the unlocked model should be very good but will probably fall short of the Galaxy S7 and S8, as the U11 lacks the 4x4 MIMO antennas for other carriers’ bands. It has all of the bands T-Mobile and Verizon use, but it lacks AT&amp;T’s supplementary bands 29 and 30, which help in high-traffic areas.</p>\n<p>Battery life on the 3,000mAh cell was good, at seven hours and one minute of LTE video streaming with the screen on full brightness. The phone supports Qualcomm’s Quick Charge technology but not wireless charging.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0041-0122/156581-1-eng-US/f0041-012.jpg\" width=\"840\" height=\"971\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0041-01\" title=\"f0041-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>ANDROID AND PERFORMANCE</b></h3><p>The U11 runs Android 7.1 with HTC’s relatively aggressive skin. The skin doesn’t hold back performance: With the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor platform on board, we got absolutely terrific benchmark scores and all-around smooth performance. The phone has 64GB of storage, 11.54GB of which is taken up by system files, plus room for a microSD card in the nano SIM card slot.</p>\n<p>The most exciting new feature, of course, is the squeeze sensor, which HTC calls Edge Sense. A sensor area about two-thirds of the way down the sides of the phone can be calibrated to your liking when you set the phone up. Then when you squeeze it, it’ll launch the camera or the flashlight. The sensor is completely customizable—you can actually use it to launch any app, and HTC says it will release an app that lets the Edge Sense hook into other apps on your phone, as a click action within the apps.</p>\n<p>Yes, it’s a gimmick. It’s not going to change your life. But it’s a useful gimmick, much like Motorola’s twist-to-camera feature. I ended up using it less than I thought I would, though, because I found the U11 to be a little uncomfortably wide to securely grip and squeeze in my hand. Folks with larger hands will likely get more use out of it.</p>\n<p>HTC’s most imposing change is to put NewsRepublic news headlines on your lock screen. Turn it off, and you’ll still get aggressive NewsRepublic alerts in your notifications. Fortunately, you can disable NewsRepublic entirely. You’ll still see news headlines in Blinkfeed, the Flipboard-like page found to the left of the main home screen.</p>\n<p>There’s also the mystery that is HTC’s Sense Companion. It’s supposed to suggest local attractions to you, and things like when to recharge your phone, but I didn’t get any suggestions from it during my test period. It may simply need more time to work.</p>\n<p>Other bloatware on the phone: UA Record, a fitness app that’s part of HTC’s deal with UnderArmour; Viveport, HTC and Valve’s VR app store; Boost, a memory optimization app; and HTC’s Zoe video editor. In general, though, HTC managed to hold off from adding too many redundant apps. The browser is Chrome, the photo app is Google Photos, and the music app is Google Play Music.</p>\n<p class=\"pullQuote\"><b>The most exciting new feature, of course, is the squeeze sensor, which HTC calls Edge Sense.</b></p>\n<h3><b>HEY, ALEXA!</b></h3><p>One of the U11’s most interesting features cannot be tested right now: It’s the first “dual wake word” phone. That means you can say “OK Google” to get the Google Assistant or “Alexa” to wake up Amazon’s voice assistant. You can even switch back and forth, query by query, depending on which one tends to give the best responses.</p>\n<p>This isn’t a mandatory feature. Alexa will be a downloadable add-on you’ll be able to get later this summer. And HTC has some potential kinks to work out: You’ll probably have to set all of your Amazon Echo devices to a different wake word, or the phone and your Echos will fight over your query.</p>\n<p>But with the growing popularity of Alexa, it’s worth keeping an eye out for this feature. No other carrier-sold phone in the U.S. lets you holler “Alexa!” to wake up Amazon’s assistant. And for what it’s worth, “OK Google” works fine, just as it does on other leading Android phones.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0043-0119/156574-1-eng-US/f0043-012.jpg\" width=\"1200\" height=\"358\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0043-01\" title=\"f0043-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>A SOUND CHOICE</b></h3><p><b>The HTC U11 for Sprint is the best music phone around, and its unusual squeeze sensor is a fun new way to interact with a mobile device. It features Gigabit LTE and a fast processor, and it’s Alexa-compatible.</b></p>\n<h3><b>A MARVELOUS MUSIC PHONE</b></h3><p>The U11 is the best music phone we’ve tested. Start with the speakers. In speakerphone or music playback mode, HTC uses a speaker on top as a “tweeter,” while the main speaker, on the bottom, is a more powerful “woofer.” The top speaker basically offers a little bit of high-end enhancement, but the overall effect is more than the sum of its parts—a noticeably richer sound than on most other phones.</p>\n<p>The included earbuds are a treat. HTC includes special Usonic USB-C earphones that work only with this phone. They use a sonar-like technology to map your hearing and equalize the phone’s sound to compensate. It’s an especially effective technology for older ears like mine: With Usonic, I got to hear a lot more high-end than I usually do, because that part of my hearing is shot. The earbuds also do a little bit of active noise cancellation when they’re playing music, but it isn’t active when music isn’t playing.</p>\n<p>The U11 has no headphone jack, but HTC supplies a special dongle with a DAC (digital to analog converter) inside. Paired with super-high-end headphones, I could hear the difference when compared with the otherwise excellent Galaxy S8: The U11 has more detailed highs, better texture and shape to sound, and longer decay. This is the first convincing argument I’ve heard for using a dongle.</p>\n<p>One exception to the U11’s audio excellence is that if you rely on wireless headphones, the phone doesn’t stand apart. It’s even a step behind the Galaxy S8. With Bluetooth 4.2 rather than Bluetooth 5.0, it can’t do the new trick of playing to two sets of headphones at once, and the sound quality of Bluetooth audio is dependent on the encoding scheme, not the phone’s own amp.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0044-0121/156567-1-eng-US/f0044-012.jpg\" width=\"1600\" height=\"622\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0044-01\" title=\"f0044-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>PHOTO PROOF</b></h3><p><b>People may be a little skeptical considering HTC’s heavy photo focus in its marketing, but the proof is in the images above. The left one was taken with the U11, the right one with the S8.</b></p>\n<h3><b>PHOTOS AND VIDEOS</b></h3><p>The U11 has a 16-megapixel front-facing camera and a 12-megapixel rear camera. The phone records “3D audio” surround stereo using its four microphones.</p>\n<p>Still-camera quality wasn’t quite up to the fearsome standards of the Galaxy S8 in testing. This is an area in which my results differ from other early reviews, and the difference may be that my phone is using Sprint firmware while other reviewers are using international units. HTC told me that the international models have a newer version of the camera software than the Sprint units do.</p>\n<p>That said, the U11 took slightly washed-out photos in which the blacks weren’t as deep and true as on the S8. In low light, the U11 managed to eke images out of even very dark surroundings, but at the cost of some blur and precision.</p>\n<p>The front-facing camera gave me a lot of pixels, but in dimly lit scenarios, the images were aggressively filtered and sharpened. HTC says camera upgrades will come.</p>\n<p>Video recording tested better than still photos. Videos in both 1080p and 4K were smooth and clear, and stabilization is available on the 1080p clips.</p>\n<p class=\"pullQuote\"><b>We’ll take another look in the months ahead to see whether this promising phone evolves into a winner.</b></p>\n<h3><b>CONCLUSIONS</b></h3><p>HTC has spun out a confusing and unconvincing set of phones so far this year. Seeing the U11, which is clearly HTC’s flagship, I wonder why the HTC U Ultra and HTC U Play came out at all—although they didn’t fully come out in the U.S., as neither phone got official carrier support.</p>\n<p>Also, the HTC U11 has a lot of unrealized promise—features we couldn’t quite test. Alexa integration, for instance, sounds great but isn’t here yet. Sense Companion doesn’t seem to do much. Gigabit LTE could pull the U11 ahead on network speeds later this year. And HTC is promising camera software upgrades to fix the image issues we saw during testing.</p>\n<p>The U11 is the best competition for the Galaxy S8 on Sprint. We’re going to keep our Editors’ Choice with the S8 for its superior camera and network performance in our tests; even though the U11’s spec sheet says differently, we have to go by our results. But while the U11 doesn’t outpace the S8, I’d suggest it to audiophiles for whom music and speakerphone are primary uses. We’ll take another look in the months ahead to see whether this promising phone evolves into a winner.</p>\n<p class=\"byline\"><b>SASCHA

You can now replace your standard incandescent bulb with a variety of connected solutions you can control with just a few taps on your smartphone or tablet. But with so many options flooding the smart-home market, which one is right for you? We’ve rounded up our highest-rated smart bulbs, along with some points to consider while shopping.</p>\n<h3><b>PRICE</b></h3><p>Smart bulbs use light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and a variety of technologies to work, so they are more expensive than traditional bulbs. That’s important to keep in mind, especially if you want to upgrade your entire house. But smart bulbs also use less energy and last a lot longer, meaning you can save money in the long run. And as you can see, most of the options on this list fall well below $100, so the price of entry isn’t as steep as it used to be even a year ago.</p>\n<p class=\"pullQuote\"><b>Since you’ll mostly be controlling these lights from your phone or tablet, you want to make sure that it’s easy to do.</b></p>\n<h3><b>COLOR AND LUMINANCE</b></h3><p>Some of the bulbs on this list are just white, while others have the ability to take on any color of the rainbow. Color is a fun way to add atmosphere to your home but often results in a pricier bulb.</p>\n<p>Most of the smart bulbs we review are marketed as equivalent to 60-watt incandescent models, which sounds self-explanatory—but some bulbs are brighter than others. To see just how bright a light is, you need to look at the lumens it puts out: the more lumens, the brighter the light. Even then, the light can disperse in a narrow beam or distribute brightness in a wide swath, so make sure to read the reviews to find out how each bulb works.</p>\n<p>Another factor to keep in mind is color temperature. Higher temperatures, like 8,500K, look like harsh office lighting, which is fine for staying awake or working. Lower temperatures, like 2,500K, translate to a cozy, warm glow that’s perfect for relaxing.</p>\n<h3><b>CONTROL</b></h3><p>Since you’ll mostly be controlling these lights from your phone or tablet, you want to make sure that it’s easy to do. If you have multiple bulbs, for instance, you’ll want a companion app that lets you easily arrange them in groups and adjust the brightness or color of an entire group at one time. Do you have an Amazon Echo at home? Look for a bulb that works with Alexa so you can control it with your voice.</p>\n<p>Of course, any bulb plugged into a socket can always be turned on or off by just flipping the switch. We pay close attention to how each app works and provide a detailed overview in each review.</p>\n<h3><b>FEATURES</b></h3><p>Smart bulbs offer a degree of control and interactivity you just can’t get with traditional bulbs, including scheduled timers and remote control options. They’re also more convenient; it’s easier to tap on a smartphone screen than to get up and trudge over to a wall switch.</p>\n<p>Most of the bulbs we’ve reviewed can be scheduled or controlled remotely, which is great if you want to save on energy costs or you often forget to turn off the lights before leaving the house. Some bulbs use geofencing, which means they work with the GPS in your smartphone to pinpoint your exact location and can automatically turn the lights on or off when you reach a certain point. Color-changing bulbs are great for mood lighting, and some can even sync up with certain movies and TV shows.</p>\n<p>As we mentioned, some bulbs hook up with Amazon’s Alexa, Apple HomeKit, or Google Assistant, so you can control your home lighting with your voice. You can also integrate some of the bulbs on this list with security cameras, thermostats, and other smart home devices. If This Then That (IFTTT) compatibility lets you create recipes that automatically cause your lights to react to certain triggers, like phone notifications or changes in weather.</p>\n<p>We don’t currently recommend bulbs that do double duty as speakers, as we haven’t found any particularly good ones in testing.</p>\n<h3><b>DO YOU NEED A HUB?</b></h3><p>One more important factor to keep in mind is that many smart bulbs need to connect to your smartphone through a home automation hub such as the Wink 2. Other bulbs cut out the middleman and connect to your phone or tablet directly via Wi-Fi, including the LIFX models. Others connect with Bluetooth, but in that case, you’re limited to control only within Bluetooth range, which means you can’t change the lights when you’re away from home. A hub also means spending more money and adding another step to the installation process. But based on the bulbs we’ve seen so far, the best ones use hubs.</p>\n<p>With all that in mind, we’ve gathered the best smart bulbs we’ve tested in this roundup. Depending on your needs, any of these options is a good place to get started in connecting your home lighting to more than just a wall switch.</p>\n<h3><b>Philips Hue White Review</b></h3><p>$14.95</p>\n<p><b>EDITORS’ CHOICE</b></p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0049-0126/156708-1-eng-US/f0049-012.jpg\" width=\"209\" height=\"30\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0049-01\" title=\"f0049-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>For anyone looking to get into smart lighting (not to mention existing Hue users), the Hue White is an excellent option.

It’s Samsung’s answer to the Microsoft Surface Pro 4, our current top pick. Because of their included hardware keyboards, 2-in-1 laptops are better bets for productivity than slate tablets. (Ever tried editing a long Word document on an iPad?) The Galaxy Book packs a brilliant Super AMOLED screen, LTE connectivity, and an impressive 14 hours of battery life, which help it stand out in a crowded field. The downside: You get only 4GB of RAM and a 128GB SSD, and at this price, you should get at least double that.</p>\n<h3><b>Samsung Galaxy Book</b></h3><p><b>(12-inch, LED)</b></p>\n<p>$1,127.99</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0051-0213/156786-1-eng-US/f0051-022.jpg\" width=\"209\" height=\"30\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0051-02\" title=\"f0051-02\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>THE SCREEN IS THE STAR</b></h3><p>The Galaxy Book’s 12-inch touch-enabled 2,160-by-1,440-resolution Super AMOLED display very well may be the main reason to buy this tablet. Images are crystal clear, and colors pop. The screen is accurate and a good match when you use programs such as Adobe Lightroom CC for organizing and proofing photos. The display on the Galaxy Book looks brighter, has better black levels, and shows more details than the In-Plane Switching (IPS) displays on the Huawei MateBook and Surface Pro 4.</p>\n<p>Bundled with the Galaxy Book is Samsung’s excellent S Pen stylus. The size and shape of a regular ink pen, it has 4,096 levels of pressure sensitivity, and it doesn’t need an AAAA battery like the Surface Pen or to be periodically charged like the Apple Pencil. The stylus supports Windows Ink and full-brush tilting in programs such as Adobe Photoshop, which makes it a useful tool for digital artists.</p>\n<p>The pen is responsive in use, but because it is passive, it functions a little differently than active styli, including the Surface Pen and the Active Pen for the Lenovo Miix 510. A button on the side of the S Pen controls erase functions, but it has no right-click or shortcut options, both of which would require powered Bluetooth. The side button also invokes Air Command, Samsung’s overlay that acts as an alternative to Windows Ink. Air Command lets you use the pen to mark up the screen and create sticky notes.</p>\n<p>The S Pen comes with a plastic loop that sticks to the keyboard cover for storage. It seems secure, though I’m not sure how long the adhesive will last before the pen loop falls off. I prefer the way the Surface Pen sticks to the side of the Surface Pro 4 or the Surface Book with magnets, or the combination of magnets and a tether line used by the Dell Latitude 5285 2-in-1.</p>\n<p>The tablet’s 5-megapixel webcam is fine for selfies and Skype calls, and the 13MP rear-facing camera is adequate for snapshots, although it could use a flash for low-light shots. Stereo speakers vent out of the left and right sides of the tablet and can fill a small- to medium-size room with sound. You’ll hear more treble than bass, but that’s not uncommon for tablets and ultraportable laptops.</p>\n<h3><b>Samsung Galaxy Book</b></h3><p><b>(12-inch, LED)</b></p>\n<p><b>PROS 14 hours of battery life.

Unlike the Apple iPad Pro and the Surface Pro, the Galaxy Book is bundled with a keyboard case. The keyboard is a must for working in a desktop operating system such as Windows 10.</p>\n<p>The keyboard has a magnetic stand that clips on to the back of the tablet and gives you four usable angles, from near flat to standing straight up. It works well but is ultimately less convenient than the continuously variable angle available from kickstands on the Dell Latitude 5285 2-in-1, the HP Spectre x2, the Lenovo Miix 510, or the Surface Pro. The omission keeps the tablet slim at 7.87 by 11.47 by 0.29 inches (HWD), and light (1.66 pounds; 2.57 pounds with the case). But this also means you’ll need to carry the case with you, since the tablet can’t stand up on its own.</p>\n<p>The backlit keyboard built into the case is comfortable to use, with a full keystroke, but it flexes when you press hard on the keys around its midsection. (That’s pretty common among keyboard covers, with the exception of the metal-bound keyboard case on the HP Spectre x2.) The one-piece touchpad is smooth and reacts quickly to inputs. It doesn’t have a two-stage latch, so you can’t tilt the keyboard as you can on the Surface Pro and most competitors.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0054-0127/156765-1-eng-US/f0054-012.jpg\" width=\"1442\" height=\"571\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0054-01\" title=\"f0054-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>QUITE ADAPTABLE</b></h3><p><b>Detachable-hybrid tablets like the Galaxy Book let you clip on a keyboard when you need to type more than 140 characters.</b></p>\n<h3><b>SPARSE (BUT SMART) CONNECTIVITY</b></h3><p>The Galaxy Book has two USB-C ports on its right side, double the number found on the Samsung Galaxy TabPro S and the Huawei MateBook. That’s important, because it means there’s a free port when you’re charging the tablet with the included USB-C cable and quick charger. The only other I/O port is a headset jack, also on the right side. Notably, the Galaxy Book doesn’t come with a USB-C-to-Type-A adapter, which is included with the HP Spectre x2.</p>\n<p>Even though you can buy one for less than $10 on Amazon, the omission is disappointing, considering that the system costs $1,300. You’ll need this adapter to connect older hard drives, flash drives, and other peripherals.</p>\n<p class=\"pullQuote\"><b>The keyboard has a magnetic stand that clips on to the tablet’s back side and gives you four usable angles.</b></p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0055-0125/156758-1-eng-US/f0055-012.jpg\" width=\"917\" height=\"575\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0055-01\" title=\"f0055-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>Wireless is handled by 802.11ac Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4.1, and there’s also a 4G LTE radio in this Verizon-exclusive model for always-available connectivity. You’ll need to sign up for an LTE data plan, but that’s easily done online or in person at a Verizon store. You can easily switch between Wi-Fi and 4G LTE networks when you’re in range of a hotspot. LTE is an option in tablets including the HP Spectre x2 and the upcoming 2017 version of the Microsoft Surface Pro but not in the Surface Pro 4.</p>\n<h3><b>SHORT ON STORAGE, MEMORY, SECURITY</b></h3><p>The $1,129.99 base model and the LTE-equipped version of the Galaxy Book come with 4GB of RAM and a 128GB SSD. While that’s usable, a Windows 10 tablet should really come with 8GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD, especially at this price. You can purchase a version of the tablet with those specs for $1,329.99, but you won’t get an LTE radio. The Surface Pro 4 comes with 8GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD for $1,299, though you’ll have to purchase its $129 Type Cover separately. The main concern is that you can’t upgrade the memory post-purchase, so you’re stuck with what you get when you open the box. On the bright side, the Galaxy Book, the HP Spectre x2, and the Surface Pro 4 all give you the option of adding up to 256GB of storage with a microSD card (in the case of the Galaxy Book, the card slot on the left side).</p>\n<p>Security features are lacking compared with similar models. Many high-end tablets come with Windows Hello (including the Dell Latitude 5285), which uses an IR Camera to log you in without a password, or a fingerprint reader (the Huawei MateBook), or both (the Microsoft Surface Pro 4). The Galaxy Book supports neither of these biometric-based security features. Instead, it comes with Samsung Flow, which lets you log into your tablet using the fingerprint reader on your Samsung Galaxy phone. The catch is it won’t work if you use another brand of Android phone or an Apple iPhone. Samsung covers the Galaxy Book with a one-year warranty.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0056-0123/156751-1-eng-US/f0056-012.jpg\" width=\"1312\" height=\"759\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0056-01\" title=\"f0056-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>JUST OK FOR WORK</b></h3><p><b>You’ll be able to get your work done, but it will feel slower, and storage will fill quicker than it would with some competitors.</b></p>\n<h3><b>DECENT PERFORMANCE, FORMIDABLE BATTERY LIFE</b></h3><p>Under the hood is an Intel Core i5-7200U processor with integrated Intel HD 620 graphics, which helped the Galaxy Book eke out a win over the Surface Pro 4 on the PCMark 8 Work Conventional (2,906 points), Handbrake (2:16), and CineBench (318 points) tests. The Dell Latitude 5285 was the overall winner on these three tests, thanks to its faster Core i7 processor. The Surface Pro 4 aced Photoshop test with the Galaxy Book coming in a distant third (4:07). The Galaxy Book, the Latitude 5285, and the Surface Pro 4 were faster across the multimedia tests than the HP Spectre x2 and Huawei MateBook, both of which use low-powered Core m processors. None of these tablets produced playable scores on our 3D gaming tests, though the Latitude 5285 came the closest.</p>\n<p>At 14 hours, 6 minutes, the Galaxy Book excelled on our battery rundown test, outlasting the Latitude 5285 (11:09), the Surface Pro 4 (10:19), the Spectre x2 (9:38), and the Huawei Matebook (6:19). With a fully charged battery, you can watch locally stored movies on the Galaxy Book for an entire trans-Pacific flight from San Francisco to the Philippines. Using the Wi-Fi or the 4G LTE connections will sap the battery faster, but it’s fair to say that the Galaxy Book will make a good travel companion if you’re going to be away from a power plug for an extended period of time.</p>\n<p class=\"pullQuote\"><b>With a fully charged battery, you can watch locally stored movies on the Galaxy Book for an entire trans-Pacific flight.</b></p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0057-0125/156744-1-eng-US/f0057-012.jpg\" width=\"1290\" height=\"657\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0057-01\" title=\"f0057-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>STELLAR SCREEN, BUT WITH SHORTCOMINGS</b></h3><p>The Samsung Galaxy Book has a top-notch screen and category-leading battery life, but several shortcomings hold it back.

These components help the Neuron blow past competitors in our gaming tests; it’s also speedy with productivity pursuits and comes with a huge amount of storage to boot. This configuration is expensive, but for what you get and relative to the Editors’ Choice Digital Storm Velox, the pricing is fair.

But there’s a lot to like inside, once you start poking around. Its black aluminum frame stands 17.8 by 9 by 15.7 inches (HWD) with tempered glass panels on both flanks. The left side is nearly a full window, while the right is backed with aluminum and has a small cutout window for the SSDs. The case isn’t a small-form-factor design, but it’s on the smaller side for traditional towers. For size comparison, the Velox stands 22.2 inches tall, 9.25 inches wide, and 19.5 inches deep, taking up much more space.</p>\n<p>The panels on either side are actually doors on rear hinges, held closed magnetically toward the front. They both swing open easily, making for one of the most accessible cases I’ve seen in a while. This lets you in to either side of the tower, which is good for swapping out components and cable and storage management beneath the motherboard. Having such easy access to the space with no screws or removable doors makes it a breeze to pop open and work in the case despite the size, and everything is organized neatly within. This includes neatly cut and routed cables, which are clipped together and funneled behind the motherboard.</p>\n<p>The CPU cooler stands vertically along the front panel and vents out the front, with a rear case fan in the back and slits along the top panel for more ventilation. The top panel lifts away if you remove one rear hand screw, though there’s not much reason to take it off. The bottom of the case is raised about 2 inches by front and back feet, so most of the bottom is above surface level. This allows the bottom vent more room to breathe, and a removable filter over it keeps out dust and debris. The front panel pops off, revealing case fans behind another removable dust filter.</p>\n<p class=\"pullQuote\"><b>Given its superior performance and overall execution, the Origin Neuron is our new top pick for high-end gaming</b></p>\n<p>Since the case on our review unit is all black, the only color comes from an array of LED lights. The customization is handled through the included Asus Aura software, for which there’s a slight learning curve. It’s not immediately clear where each setting is (and the arrow to switch between each lighting element is particularly small), but once you spend some time poking around, you should get the gist of it. The color and effects of an interior LED light strip, the RAM, the LED ring around the power button, and a slim strip on the front panel can all be changed.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0060-0123/156836-1-eng-US/f0060-012.jpg\" width=\"1455\" height=\"809\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0060-01\" title=\"f0060-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>OOH, SHINY!</b></h3><p><b>The left side of the Origin Neuron is nearly a full window, allowing you to look in at the components and show off the lighting.</b></p>\n<p>The RAM in our unit is G.Skill TridentZ RGB, which is illuminated in customizable segments. You can change the colors of five discrete sections of each stick, which can lead to some cool designs and color combinations or make lighting “flow” down each stick in conjunction with the case lighting, which is a really cool effect. All of the lighting can also fade in and out slowly, or you can have the LED strip and RAM alternately strobe on and off.</p>\n<p>The case is not only well designed for maintenance but is also packed with the high-end components you’d hope for at this configuration’s price. Everything is powered by an 850W EVGA SuperNOVA G3 power supply, which can run the demanding dual graphics card setup (two Nvidia GTX 1080 Tis in SLI), and the wattage leaves you some headroom. A lightning-fast Intel Core i7-7700K processor, overclocked to 5.0GHz out of the box, serves as the heart of the system. To supplement that are 32GB of the 3,000MHz G.Skill memory in our model, and since it’s set up as four 8GB sticks, the system has no free DIMM slots.</p>\n<p>Storage comes in the form of two 250GB Samsung 960 EVO NVMe M.2 SSDs in a RAID 0 array, along with two 2TB Seagate Firecuda hybrid drives—a one-two punch that delivers a massive amount of storage and a super-fast boot drive. It adds to the price for sure, but if you do a lot of media work, you’ll appreciate the added speed, and there’s more than enough room for many projects and games. As configured, two 2.5-inch and two 3.5-inch storage bays are still free.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0061-0125/156829-1-eng-US/f0061-012.jpg\" width=\"1436\" height=\"821\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0061-01\" title=\"f0061-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>CONNECT UP</b></h3><p><b>The rear panel has a USB-C port, a USB-A port, four USB 3.0 ports, two USB 2.0 ports, and the seven DisplayPort connections and 3 HDMI ports from the graphics cards.</b></p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0062-0127/156822-1-eng-US/f0062-012.jpg\" width=\"917\" height=\"480\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0062-01\" title=\"f0062-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p class=\"pullQuote\"><b>Gaming and 3D performance are where the Origin Neuron really separates itself from the pack.</b></p>\n<p>The Neuron won’t leave you wanting for connectivity options. At first glance, it doesn’t seem as though the case has any front-facing ports, but a small panel at the top retracts to reveal two USB 3.0 ports as well as a headphone jack and a mic jack. The top panel has no ports, just the LED-ringed power button. The rear panel holds the vast majority of connections: a USB-C port, a USB-A port, four more USB 3.0 ports, and two USB 2.0 ports. Via the graphics cards, you get a total of seven DisplayPort connections and three HDMI ports. The system also has built-in Bluetooth and dual-band 802.11ac wireless. Origin includes lifetime 24/7 support and free lifetime labor, alongside a one-year part-replacement warranty.</p>\n<h3><b>INSANE POWER FOR GAMING AND PRODUCTIVITY</b></h3><p>With such premium parts, it’s no surprise that the Neuron is a performance dynamo. When you’re paying for a dual 1080 Ti desktop, you should expect no less than top-end speed, which it delivers across all tests. In terms of general productivity, the Neuron was one of the fastest computers we’ve tested. Its PCMark 8 Work Conventional score beat all comers, including the Digital Storm Velox, the 2016 Falcon Northwest Talon, and the Maingear Rush X99 Super Stock. In the multimedia test results (timed Photoshop and Handbrake tests, plus the CineBench score), the Neuron didn’t lead the pack in such dominant fashion, but it was right up there with the best of the category.</p>\n<p>Gaming and 3D performance are where the Origin Neuron really separates itself from the pack. The competitors are all fast desktops, many of which are equipped with GTX 1080s in SLI, but the 1080 Ti upgrade pushes the Neuron to the front. It scored a category-best 21,481 points on 3D Mark’s Fire Strike Extreme test. Its Cloud Gate score is on the top end, as well. I should note that in real-world use, the Falcon Northwest Talon’s dual Pascal Titan X cards should provide more power, which doesn’t fully translate on the synthetic tests, but the Talon configuration we tested rings north of $9,500.</p>\n<p>The Heaven and Valley gaming tests tell the same story of the Neuron’s capabilities. Set to Ultra quality and 1080p resolution, the Neuron averaged 278 frames per second (fps) on Heaven and 175fps on Valley. When it’s cranked up to 4K, the desktop averaged 95fps and 113fps on these same tests, proving it’s more than capable of smooth 4K gaming. I further confirmed this by playing Doom in 4K at maximum settings; the in-game frame counter hovered around 100fps or higher for most of the time I was playing. I also played The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt in 4K with all the settings and effects on Ultra, and I had a similar smooth experience.</p>\n<h3><b>A CLEAR LEADER IN DESKTOP GAMING</b></h3><p>Sure, the Neuron is more expensive than single-GPU desktops such as the Gamer Master Ultra, but you get what you pay for. It’s still thousands of dollars less than other high-end systems, including the Falcon Northwest Talon and Maingear Rush X99 Super Stock (though those PCs do come with their own top-end advantages), and the stylish but functional case provides a great home for the premium hardware.</p>\n<p>If you can afford the high-end components, it’s tough to beat the power, design, and organization offered by the Origin Neuron. For its design, pricing, and impressive gaming capability, the Origin Neuron is our new Editors’ Choice for high-end gaming desktops.</p>\n<p class=\"byline\"><b>MATTHEW

snapshots of your baby niece. But you can’t really mount your phone on a wall or stash it in your wallet for anytime viewing of a favorite shot. Even though it seems like we’ve moved past printed matter, printing your most prized photos still has value, and there are plenty of services that can do it for you.</p>\n<p>Here’s what you should consider when you need to create physical mementos from your digital memories.</p>\n<h3><b>FIRST AND FOREMOST: PRICING</b></h3><p>It turns out that you can get hardcopy keepsakes of your visual memories without breaking the bank. Some services we tested, including Snapfish and York Photo Labs, produce 4-by-6-inch prints for just 9 cents apiece, and those two services have offers that get you the first 100 and 20 prints free, respectively, not including tax and shipping. Surprisingly, Walgreens Photo is the most expensive service when it comes to 4-by-6 prints, charging 29 cents each. But you pay for the convenience of local pickup, and after 50 prints, that price drops to 20 cents per 4-by-6. The next-priciest 4-by-6 photos among the services we tested were from Nations Photo Labs, at 27 cents each, but the company provided the best image quality and paper. In the middle is Shutterfly’s 15-cent 4-by-6 prints.</p>\n<p>Even when you want enlargements at popular sizes such as 5-by-7 and 8-by-10, you don’t have to spend a lot. Snapfish offers 5-by-7 prints for just 69 cents each, and Nations Photo Labs produces excellent-quality 8-by-10 photos for a mere $1.90 each. That’s the best price we found for 8-by-10 prints; most competitors charge a still-reasonable $2.99 to $3.99. For wall-art size prints, of course, you’ll pay more, but it’s still not exorbitant: All of the services sell 16-by-20 prints for under $20, and most charge closer to $15.</p>\n<h3><b>PLASTER YOUR PICTURES ANYWHERE</b></h3><p>Why stop at ordinary photo prints when you can have your pictures grace mugs, playing cards, and even pillows? The services reviewed here offer a remarkable assortment of objects that you can personalize. All offer greeting cards, calendars, and photo books. Most offer phone cases, blankets, and drinkware. Shutterfly offers the largest selection of photo gifts, including flower pots, blankets, phone cases, pillows, shower curtains, and even pet-food bowls. But York Photo Labs is the only service we found that can sell you a necktie featuring your picture.</p>\n<h3><b>EDITING, ORDERING, AND SHARING</b></h3><p>When you’re ordering photos online, it helps if the service has a friendly, navigable website. For example, most services, including Snapfish, let you simply check off all the sizes you want on a single-page grid. Others make you select a size for printing before choosing the images you want; you then must start over again if you want prints in other sizes.</p>\n<p>The services offer good photo-editing tools, letting you brighten or darken an underexposed or overexposed shot, for example. Many services automatically apply color correction. Nations Photo Labs offers high-level photo editing for a price premium, but we didn’t see a big difference in our test prints between premium color-corrections and standard prints.</p>\n<p>Online sharing is offered by some services, and Shutterfly is particularly strong in this capability, even letting you create online mini-websites for your photos. Snapfish and Walgreens Photo let you share online galleries that can be viewed as full-window slideshows. York Photos shared galleries are little more than batches of thumbnails, and Nations Photo Lab doesn’t get involved in online gallery sharing.</p>\n<h3><b>MOBILE APPS</b></h3><p>The most popular camera these days is one that’s always with you: your phone. And smartphones have come a long way in terms of image quality; some capture images with more than 20 megapixels of resolution. With most photos now being taken by phones, it only makes sense for a photo printing service to offer a mobile app to get the images straight from your phone to the print service. York offers a very basic app that lets you only upload and order prints. Shutterfly adds the ability to order photo gifts, and Snapfish and Walgreens Photo’s apps can import photos from social networks, perform some editing, and share photos with friends. Nations is the only service in this group with no mobile app.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0066-0128/156970-1-eng-US/f0066-012.jpg\" width=\"809\" height=\"773\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0066-01\" title=\"f0066-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>DELIVERY</b></h3><p>When you want your pictures pronto, Walgreens Photo is the way to go. (Look for upcoming reviews of Walmart Photo and CVS Photo, which also let you pick up prints locally.) In our testing, Walgreens Photo didn’t provide the best enlargements in terms of image quality, but its smaller prints were perfectly acceptable.</p>\n<p class=\"pullQuote\"><b>With most photos now being taken by phones, it only makes sense for a photo printing service to offer a mobile app.</b></p>\n<p>When you can wait a few days or you want special options not available with local pickup, such as matte finish, mail order is provided by all the services tested. None of them took an inordinate amount of time, and shipping costs for our order of 22 photos of various sizes ranged from $2.34 for York Photo Labs to $7 for Nations Photo Lab—but the reason for the difference was stark. York packaged the photos in a thin, standard large envelope, while the carefully protected Nations order arrived in multiple layers of cardboard and clear plastic envelopes.</p>\n<p>Need faster delivery? Most services offer second-day and overnight shipping, but keep in mind that the products still have to be produced, so that doesn’t mean your photos will arrive the day after you order them, necessarily, even if you pay the $15 for overnight shipping. But it may mean your pictures arrive four days earlier. In practice, none of our test orders, for which we used the lowest-cost shipping options, took more than five days to arrive.</p>\n<h3><b>PRINT QUALITY</b></h3><p>For us, this is the most important factor when ordering prints: how accurately the photos reproduce the images you shot. Most of the prints I received, especially at the smaller 4-by-6-inch size, revealed acceptable image quality. When you get to enlargements, however, the differences became far more apparent. In particular, we found that the Walgreens Photo prints exhibited discoloration and lost detail, while the Nations Photo Lab prints showed the best image quality. In one mountain photograph we had printed, the sky in the Walgreens Photo picture had a pinkish and purplish tinge that wasn’t in the original, and some cloud detail was lost to white.</p>\n<p>Images from Nations Photo Lab, on the other hand, looked natural and showed the truest black in a portrait with a black backdrop. Nations is also the only service that uses the truly professional-quality Kodak Endura paper.</p>\n<p>Here are our evaluations of five photo services. (Prices are for one 4-by-6 print.)</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0068-0126/156963-1-eng-US/f0068-012.jpg\" width=\"296\" height=\"173\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0068-01\" title=\"f0068-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>Snapfish</b></h3><p>$0.09</p>\n<p><b>EDITORS’ CHOICE</b></p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0068-0213/156956-1-eng-US/f0068-022.jpg\" width=\"209\" height=\"30\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0068-02\" title=\"f0068-02\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>You might think there’s no difference between the two big names in online photo-print ordering services, Snapfish and Shutterfly, but I was surprised and impressed at the striking difference. Snapfish not only uses a more modern and powerful web interface, it also delivers better-looking images at lower prices. In fact, its prices were the lowest among the services I tested, and you even get the first 100 4-by-6 prints free. For value and website design, Snapfish earns our Editors’ Choice, but the slightly more expensive Nations Photo Lab, also an Editor’s Choice, offers slightly better image quality and packaging.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0068-032/156949-1-eng-US/f0068-032.jpg\" width=\"352\" height=\"351\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0068-03\" title=\"f0068-03\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>Nations Photo Lab</b></h3><p>$0.27</p>\n<p><b>EDITORS’ CHOICE</b></p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0068-04/156942-1-eng-US/f0068-042.jpg\" width=\"208\" height=\"29\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0068-04\" title=\"f0068-04\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>Buying prints from Nations is a bit less streamlined than with the bigger consumer-targeted services like Shutterfly and Snapfish, but the results are worth it. Not only did my test prints reveal the best overall image quality, but they were shipped in the most protective packaging. And pricing is very reasonable. Nations Photo Labs is PCMag’s Editors’ Choice for photo printing services for its top image quality, joining Snapfish, which is our top pick for best value in the category.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0068-05/156935-1-eng-US/f0068-052.jpg\" width=\"199\" height=\"286\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0068-05\" title=\"f0068-05\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>Shutterfly</b></h3><p>$0.15</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0068-06/156928-1-eng-US/f0068-062.jpg\" width=\"209\" height=\"30\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0068-06\" title=\"f0068-06\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>Shutterfly has a few feathers in its cap, but overall, it’s a middle-of-the-road service.

your information safe and your privacy protected, even on an Android device, you need a virtual private network (VPN). The KeepSolid VPN Unlimited app secures your web activity from prying eyes and offers several advanced tools to keep you safe. The service stands out with an excellent mobile interface and a robust network of international servers, and it even blocks ads—and all that is offered at an exceedingly reasonable price. It joins Private Internet Access, with its unmatched network size, and the versatile, powerful NordVPN as an Editors’ Choice winner for Android VPN apps.</p>\n<h3><b>KeepSolid VPN Unlimited</b></h3><p><b>(for Android)</b></p>\n<p>$6.99 per month</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0070-025/157034-1-eng-US/f0070-022.jpg\" width=\"209\" height=\"30\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0070-02\" title=\"f0070-02\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>KeepSolid VPN Unlimited</b></h3><p><b>(for Android)</b></p>\n<p><b>PROS Fast and affordable protection.

Out in the wild, it’s a different story. It’s very difficult to tell if you’re actually connected to the Starbucks Wi-Fi or to a malicious network being run by a data-hungry scammer. With a VPN, you can be assured that no matter where you go and no matter what networks you connect to, your data is always secure. The VPN software creates an encrypted tunnel to a server the company controls, meaning that anyone snooping on your traffic will see only unreadable ciphertext.</p>\n<p>Once you’re online, advertisers can track your movements among websites with sophisticated cookies and trackers embedded in ads, associating your traffic with your known IP address. But with a VPN, you can rest assured that your privacy is respected. That’s because instead of seeing the actual IP address of your mobile device, the advertisers see only the IP address of the VPN server to which you’re connected.</p>\n<p>When you’re connected over a cellular network, the situation is a little different. The 3G and LTE bands are encrypted and considered fairly safe. But a dedicated hacker can use a Femtocell, basically a portable cell tower, to offer up an unsecure 2G network and then jam the higher bands, forcing you to fail over to the unsecure network. A VPN can help protect against this kind of sophisticated attack too, though it’s worth noting that the chance of coming up against such a sophisticated cell hacker is very small. They’re far less common than the garden-variety Wi-Fi snooper.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0072-0124/157020-1-eng-US/f0072-012.jpg\" width=\"591\" height=\"707\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0072-01\" title=\"f0072-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>PRICING AND FEATURES</b></h3><p>A month-long subscription with VPN Unlimited costs only $6.99, making it quite affordable as VPNs go. It’s just 4 cents more expensive than Editors’ Choice winner Private Internet Access. You can also choose to pay $39.99 for a year or a 100-year plan for $499 (on sale for $149 at the time we wrote this), if you plan on doing some serious web browsing over the next century.</p>\n<p>Those are the plans listed on the site, but you have a lot more flexibility once you create an account with KeepSolid. There is, for example, a three-month subscription for $14.99 and a one-week subscription for $2.99. I really like KeepSolid’s pricing, especially the super-short plans. It’s perfect for when you’re traveling abroad, where you’re likely to be subject to all kinds of attacks.</p>\n<p>You can pay even less for a VPN. TunnelBear, for example, offers an excellent free VPN option. With a free account, you get 500MB of data across all your TunnelBear devices, and can earn additional data by Tweeting about the company. Unfortunately, there aren’t many other free VPN services for Android.</p>\n<p>If you already use KeepSolid VPN Unlimited on your desktop, don’t worry; you don’t have to pay extra for mobile devices. They do, however, count toward your five simultaneous connections. That’s an average number of devices for a VPN subscription, and it’s surprising how fast these add up. If you need more devices on your plan, you can add one for 99 cents per month, five for $2.99 per month, or 10 devices for $5.99.</p>\n<p>You also get access to the service’s 1,200 servers across 80 global locations. That’s not as many as Editors’ Choice winner NordVPN, which boasts hundreds of servers, or the thousands of servers available with Private Internet Access, but it’s not bad. While companies often spin servers up and down as needed, these are important figures to keep in mind. The more servers a company offers, the less likely it is that you’ll have to share precious bandwidth with other users on the same server. The more server locations there are, the more likely it is you’ll find one nearby. A good rule of thumb is that the closer the server is to your actual location, the better speed and performance you’ll have. (And many server locations give you more options when spoofing your location.)</p>\n<p>If you’re traveling (or living) in a country with restrictive information policies, you can also use KeepSolid Wise, a feature that trades speed for a stealthier connection that disguises your VPN connection as normal HTTPS traffic. This feature is available on Android and is best used when connecting in countries that frown on the use of VPNs.</p>\n<p>As with the desktop version, the Android app uses the OpenVPN protocol. I appreciate it when services embrace this newer open-source protocol, which gets frequent updates as needed. Some companies offer one set of protocols with the desktop app and a different set with the mobile version, an approach I don’t favor.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0073-0128/157013-1-eng-US/f0073-012.jpg\" width=\"1455\" height=\"859\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0073-01\" title=\"f0073-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p class=\"pullQuote\"><b>The Censorship Test automatically detects when any of a set list of sites is blocked on your network.</b></p>\n<p>Recently, KeepSolid added a collection of new features. The Censorship Test automatically detects when any of a set list of sites is blocked on your network, and you have the option to send the results to KeepSolid in exchange for an extra day added to your subscription for free. The DNS Firewall is actually a collection of tools, including malware detection, tracker blocking, and ad blocking. I’m really glad to see these features included, but don’t mistake them for perfect protection. Instead of scanning for threats, these are blacklists maintained by KeepSolid. It’s a good start but hardly complete protection.</p>\n<h3><b>HANDS ON WITH KEEPSOLID VPN UNLIMITED</b></h3><p>KeepSolid sticks with its clean, minimalist desktop design for its Android app. At the center is a map showing your current location. Tap the green bar at the top, and you can select the server of your choice, although the app recommends what it thinks is best based on your location and the traffic already flowing through its other servers. I particularly like that the app shows you which servers are the most crowded and which allow torrenting. You can search for servers at the top and favorite servers for later use.</p>\n<p>KeepSolid’s app reminds me of NordVPN quite a bit, with its large map at the center. But I prefer a few things about NordVPN, such as specialized servers for connecting to Tor and double encryption. KeepSolid has added a specialized video streaming server, which I appreciate.</p>\n<p>A toggle switch at the bottom of the screen switches the VPN on and off. You can also do this from a panel in the notifications pull-down menu. When connected, the Android OS shows a little key next to the time at the top of the screen.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0075-0124/157006-1-eng-US/f0075-012.jpg\" width=\"902\" height=\"667\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0075-01\" title=\"f0075-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>THE INTERFACE</b></h3><p><b>KeepSolid VPN Unlimited secures your traffic and offers additional protection to boot. It offers good speeds and a strong server selection, making it an excellent choice.</b></p>\n<p>By default, the app always reconnects if it loses communication with the VPN server. But you can choose to have it reconnect only when you’re using Wi-Fi or to reconnect only when you’re using an unsecured network. That kind of granular control is great when you’re on a mobile device. It’s a feature I like, and I am disappointed that I have yet to see it become commonplace among other VPN apps.</p>\n<p>If lots of settings and features are what you need in a VPN, KeepSolid will get you most of the way there, but Private Internet Access has still more going on. With that service, you can select which apps must use the VPN and which don’t have to, giving you total control of how your data moves. TunnelBear VPN also offers this feature.</p>\n<p>When I reviewed the company’s VPN service for PCs, a company representative confirmed KeepSolid’s zero-logging policy. That means it retains little information about users, ensuring your privacy. The company is also located in New York, meaning that it’s not subject to specific data-retention laws. Also, KeepSolid does not inject ads into your web browsing experience, as some less-reputable VPNs have been known to do in the not-so-distant past.</p>\n<h3><b>SPEED TESTS</b></h3><p>No matter which VPN service you choose, it will have an impact on internet connection performance. Generally, it’s not a good one, although my work testing desktop VPN apps has revealed that the fastest VPNs can sometimes improve performance.</p>\n<p>When I test mobile VPN apps, I aim for a best-case scenario. First I deactivate mobile data, and then I connect to our super-fast FiOS Wi-Fi network. That’s because a Wi-Fi network offers more repeatable test results than a cellular network can, and because insecure or malicious Wi-Fi networks are a much more prevalent threat than complex cellular attacks.</p>\n<p>I then compare the average results with the VPN enabled to the average results without the VPN and work out the percent change. I measure the speeds using the Ookla <a href=\"http://Speedtest.net\" target=\"_self\">Speedtest.net</a> app. (Note that Ookla is owned by Ziff Davis, which also owns PCMag.)</p>\n<p>In my testing, I found that VPN Unlimited increased latency by 131.3 percent. That might seem like a lot, but we’re talking milliseconds here. TorGuard had the smallest impact on latency I’ve yet seen, increasing it by only 12.5 percent.</p>\n<p>In the download test, VPN Unlimited reduced speeds by 35.32 percent. That’s an improvement over the last time I tested KeepSolid’s Android app. It’s also the second-best score I’ve recorded so far. VPN Unlimited still trails Private Internet Access, however, which showed a remarkable 10.3 degradation in download speeds.</p>\n<p>In my testing, I found that with KeepSolid, upload speeds fell 18.8 percent. That’s one of the best scores for this test, but it’s still behind Spotflux VPN, which actually improved upload speeds in my testing.</p>\n<h3><b>A EXCELLENT CHOICE</b></h3><p>Along with its core VPN technology, KeepSolid VPN Unlimited comes with a few other tricks up its sleeve to keep you safe. It also performed well in my speed tests and offers a robust global infrastructure to secure your web traffic no matter where you are. Best of all, it has the most comprehensive and flexible pricing of any VPN I’ve yet reviewed, making it an excellent purchase. For all that, it takes an Editors’ Choice award for Android VPN, along with NordVPN and Private Internet Access.</p>\n<p class=\"byline\"><b>MAX
