Sometimes, though, you connect the AC adapter—usually because the battery is nearly drained—and you get nothing. No chirp, no lights, and no brightened display. And no battery charging. What went wrong, and what can you do about it?</p>\n<p>Between the wall outlet and your battery are several steps and parts that can all fail. Some are easy to fix yourself with a software tweak or a new battery, but other problems may require a visit to a repair shop or even a full-blown system replacement. Knowing which is which can save you hours of frustration and hundreds of dollars in repairs. By taking an inside-out approach, you can quickly narrow down where the problem originates and find the most economical solution.</p>\n<p class=\"pullQuote\"><b>No software tweak or hardware repair can make a disconnected laptop magically power on.</b></p>\n<h3><b>1. Are You Plugged In?</b></h3><p>It sounds silly, but you need to make sure the laptop is actually plugged in. No software tweak or hardware repair can make a disconnected laptop magically power on. So before you do anything else, ensure that the AC outlet and laptop plugs are firmly seated.</p>\n<p>Check the AC adapter brick and verify that any removable cords are fully inserted. Next, make sure that the battery is properly seated in its compartment, and that there is nothing wrong with either the battery or laptop contact points. Finally, find out whether the problem doesn’t lie with the laptop at all: Try plugging the power cord into a different outlet to see if you’ve got a short or a blown fuse.</p>\n<p>At this point, we’ve determined that it’s not just user error causing the problem. There is a real issue with powering the laptop; now it’s simply a matter of figuring out where the problem may be. That begins with eliminating where it isn’t. We’ll start with the most common and easy-to-address issues.</p>\n<h3><b>2. Lose the Battery</b></h3><p>A simple way to check the integrity of the battery is to remove it entirely and try plugging in the laptop. If the laptop powers on properly, the problem is likely a bum battery.</p>\n<h3><b>3. Make Sure You’re Using the Right USB-C Port</b></h3><p>USB-C is a popular cross-platform standard for charging, peripherals, and data transfer. The new standard allows for thinner devices but might also cause some confusion. Some manufacturers have opted to make USB-C ports data-only—so those ports can’t be used to charge your device.</p>\n<p>For example, the new Huawei MateBook X has two USB-C ports: one that can be used for charging or data transfer and one that is designated only for data transfer or connecting to a dock. If you run into a non-charging issue, make sure you are connected to the correct USB-C port.</p>\n<h3><b>4. Breaks, Burnout, and Shorts</b></h3><p>Feel along the length of the power cord, bending and flexing as you go, to check for kinks or breaks. Check the ends for broken connections, such as plugs pulling loose or spots that may have gotten chewed by a pet or caught in a vacuum cleaner. Inspect the AC brick. Is it discolored? Are any parts warped or expanded? Give it a sniff—if it smells like burnt plastic, that’s likely where the trouble lies.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0130-0120/157464-1-eng-US/f0130-012.jpg\" width=\"1430\" height=\"730\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0130-01\" title=\"f0130-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>5. Check the Connector</b></h3><p>When you plug in the laptop’s power connector, the connection should be fairly solid. If it’s suddenly wobbly or loose, or if the receiving socket gives when it should stay firm, the power jack may have broken inside the chassis. Are there discolorations or any sort of burning smell? If there seems to be any damage to the power connector, repairs will be in order.</p>\n<h3><b>6. Beat the Heat</b></h3><p>A non-charging battery can sometimes be caused by an overheating laptop. The system is shutting down to prevent overheating a battery and perhaps causing a fire, so the problem is actually two-fold. Also, as the temperature rises, the battery sensor may misfire, telling the system that the battery is either fully charged or missing completely, causing the charging problems.</p>\n<p>These problems become far more likely with older laptops, which don’t have the quality of cooling technology used today, or when you’re using the laptop on the couch or in bed with a blanket or pillow covering the cooling vents. Let the system cool down and take the time to make sure that the air vents are clean and unobstructed.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0131-0121/157457-1-eng-US/f0131-012.jpg\" width=\"1455\" height=\"697\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0131-01\" title=\"f0131-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>GET OUT OF BED!</b></h3><p><b>It might be cozy, but if a blanket covers your laptop’s cooling vents, the machine could overheat and shut itself down.</b></p>\n<h3><b>7. Swap Out the Cord and Battery</b></h3><p>These are the cheapest and easiest-to-swap parts on the laptop. A replacement power cable can often be had for under $10 on Amazon, and replacement batteries can be picked up for under $100.</p>\n<p>Replacement cables are most easily found by searching under the model name of the laptop, while batteries often have their own model numbers. Look for a replacement that matches the voltage specifications of the equipment your laptop came with, and be aware that cheap replacement parts from third-party manufacturers may not have the quality of the originals.</p>\n<p>At this point, we’ve eliminated the problems caused by kinked cords or environmental causes. If you still find yourself powerless, the problem lies within the computer itself, either a software issue or faulty hardware. Let’s start by looking at the settings and software.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0132-0121/157450-1-eng-US/f0132-012.jpg\" width=\"868\" height=\"652\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0132-01\" title=\"f0132-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>8. Check Your Settings</b></h3><p>Windows laptops: In the Control Panel, open up Power Options. Open the plan settings and visually check that all are properly set. Be on the lookout for incorrect settings for the battery, display, and sleep options. For example, your battery settings may cause trouble if you set the computer to shut down when the battery level drops too low or set the low battery level at too high a percentage.</p>\n<p>You can also assign actions including sleep and shutdown when your lid is closed or the power button is pressed. If these settings have been changed, it’s easy to suspect a power malfunction even though there’s no physical problem with the battery or charging cable. The easiest way to make sure that your settings aren’t causing problems is to restore the power profile to default settings.</p>\n<p>Mac laptops: In System Preferences, select the Energy Saver pane and review your preferences. Mac settings are adjusted with a slider, letting you select the amount of time the computer can sit idle until it goes to sleep. If the interval is too short, you might suspect battery issues when settings are the true culprit. And don’t forget to check these settings for both battery power and wall power. You may want to revert back to the default settings to see whether a change in settings is causing the problem.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0133-0120/157443-1-eng-US/f0133-012.jpg\" width=\"1310\" height=\"951\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0133-01\" title=\"f0133-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>9. Update Your Drivers</b></h3><p>Windows laptops: Open the Device Manager. Under “Batteries,” you should see three items: one for the battery, another for the charger, and a third listed as “Microsoft ACPI Compliant Control Method Battery.” Open each item, which will bring up a Properties window. Under the “Driver” tab, you’ll see a button labeled “Update Driver.” Go through the driver update process for all three. Once the drivers are all up to date, reboot the laptop and plug it in again. If this doesn’t resolve the problem, uninstall “Microsoft ACPI Compliant Control Method Battery” completely and reboot.</p>\n<p>Mac laptops: On a Mac, you’ll need to try resetting the System Management Controller (SMC). For laptops with removable batteries, this is as simple as shutting down power, removing the battery, disconnecting power, and pressing the power button for 5 seconds. Reinsert the battery, reconnect the power, and fire up the laptop.</p>\n<p>For newer Macs with batteries sealed into the chassis, shut down the computer but leave the power adapter connected. With the power off, press and hold the power button while pressing the Shift-Control-Option keys on the left-hand side of the keyboard. Release the keys and power button simultaneously, then attempt to power on the laptop.</p>\n<p class=\"pullQuote\"><b>Your make and model of laptop will likely have unique issues, and a seasoned tech-support operator will have seen all of them.</b></p>\n<h3><b>10. Call In Outside Assistance</b></h3><p>If you haven’t already, this is probably a good time to contact tech support. Your particular make and model of laptop will likely have unique issues, and a seasoned tech-support operator will have seen all of them. He or she will likely walk you through many of the steps outlined above but will also be aware of software and hardware issues specific to your configuration, such as which hardware commonly fails.</p>\n<h3><b>11. Problems Inside</b></h3><p>When all your options are exhausted—you’ve tried other power cables and batteries, you’ve checked and rechecked your settings, you’ve fixed any potential software problems—the problem is likely found inside the machine. Common culprits include a faulty motherboard, wonky logic boards, damaged charging circuits, and malfunctioning battery sensors.</p>\n<p>Like a sick person consulting a doctor, you need to see a specialist. Contact your manufacturer about what repair options are covered under your warranty or call up a local computer repair shop.</p>\n","layout":{},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":0,"link_source":"","competition":[],"flatplan_title":"","notes":"","gutter_credit":"","other":"","image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1498510597.1653","name":"f0128-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0128-0119/157471-1-eng-US/f0128-012.jpg?t=default_ipad_portrait&ext/f0128-012_default_ipad_portrait.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"768","height":"480","legacy_id":"13361","is_default":true},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1498510597.1653","name":"f0128-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0128-0119/157471-1-eng-US/f0128-012.jpg?t=default_ipad_landscape&ext/f0128-012_default_ipad_landscape.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"1024","height":"641","legacy_id":"13361","is_default":false}],"related_objects":{"image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_4_1498510592.8366","name":"f0133-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0133-0120/157443-1-eng-US/f0133-012.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"1310","height":"951","legacy_id":"13357"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_4_1498510592.8366","name":"f0133-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0133-0120/157443-1-eng-US/f0133-012.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"1310","height":"951","legacy_id":"13357"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_3_1498510593.9615","name":"f0132-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0132-0121/157450-1-eng-US/f0132-012.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"868","height":"652","legacy_id":"13358"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_3_1498510593.9615","name":"f0132-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0132-0121/157450-1-eng-US/f0132-012.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"868","height":"652","legacy_id":"13358"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_2_1498510594.967","name":"f0131-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0131-0121/157457-1-eng-US/f0131-012.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"1455","height":"697","legacy_id":"13359"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_2_1498510594.967","name":"f0131-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0131-0121/157457-1-eng-US/f0131-012.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"1455","height":"697","legacy_id":"13359"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_1_1498510596.006","name":"f0130-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0130-0120/157464-1-eng-US/f0130-012.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"1430","height":"730","legacy_id":"13360"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_1_1498510596.006","name":"f0130-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0130-0120/157464-1-eng-US/f0130-012.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"1430","height":"730","legacy_id":"13360"}]},"url_alias":"http://pcmagazine-us.audiencemedia.com","type":"story","order":"18","folio_number":"128","folio_numbers":"128,129,130,131,132,133,134","pdf_page_index":"128","thumbnail":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0128-0119/157471-1-eng-US/f0128-012.jpg?t=tablet_story_thumbnail&ext/f0128-012_tablet_story_thumbnail.jpg","color":"FFFFFF","real_id":"13356","main_section_id":"905","ads":[]},{"id":"zinio_528_100340926_1498510598.8401","title":"How

Then click on the button that says “Edit sync settings.” Make sure the options to “Get notifications from this PC on my phone” and “Upload notifications from this PC to the cloud” are both turned on.</p>\n<p>Now type or speak your reminder to Cortana on your Windows 10 device. For example, you can say to Cortana: “Set up an appointment with Mary for 3 p.m. on Tuesday to discuss next week’s presentation.” When your notification comes due, you’ll see and hear it on your phone as well as on your Windows 10 device. As long as you have one or the other with you, you’ll be sure to get the virtual tap on the shoulder for your appointment.</p>\n","layout":{},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":0,"link_source":"","competition":[],"flatplan_title":"","notes":"","gutter_credit":"","other":"","image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1498510602.06","name":"f0135-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0135-0120/157521-1-eng-US/f0135-012.jpg?t=default_ipad_portrait&ext/f0135-012_default_ipad_portrait.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"768","height":"415","legacy_id":"13367","is_default":true},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1498510602.06","name":"f0135-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0135-0120/157521-1-eng-US/f0135-012.jpg?t=default_ipad_landscape&ext/f0135-012_default_ipad_landscape.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"1024","height":"553","legacy_id":"13367","is_default":false}],"related_objects":{"image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_3_1498510598.948","name":"f0137-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0137-0120/157500-1-eng-US/f0137-012.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"973","height":"849","legacy_id":"13364"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_3_1498510598.948","name":"f0137-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0137-0120/157500-1-eng-US/f0137-012.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"973","height":"849","legacy_id":"13364"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_2_1498510600.0949","name":"f0136-02","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0136-022/157507-1-eng-US/f0136-022.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"975","height":"425","legacy_id":"13365"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_2_1498510600.0949","name":"f0136-02","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0136-022/157507-1-eng-US/f0136-022.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"975","height":"425","legacy_id":"13365"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_1_1498510601.0885","name":"f0136-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0136-0118/157514-1-eng-US/f0136-012.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"973","height":"559","legacy_id":"13366"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_1_1498510601.0885","name":"f0136-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0136-0118/157514-1-eng-US/f0136-012.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"973","height":"559","legacy_id":"13366"}]},"url_alias":"http://pcmagazine-us.audiencemedia.com","type":"story","order":"19","folio_number":"135","folio_numbers":"135,136,137","pdf_page_index":"135","thumbnail":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_874/storage/images/media2/images/f0135-0120/157521-1-eng-US/f0135-012.jpg?t=tablet_story_thumbnail&ext/f0135-012_tablet_story_thumbnail.jpg","color":"FFFFFF","real_id":"13363","main_section_id":"905","ads":[]}],"type":null,"ads":[]}}
