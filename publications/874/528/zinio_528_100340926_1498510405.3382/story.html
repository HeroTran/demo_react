    </div><p>Baffling that Apple has abandoned the [MacBook] Air market. I work with Apple and Surface due to my job, but I use my Surface more and more. I wanted to upgrade my Air to something higher-performing with USB-C and USB 3.x, but Apple just seems to be out of touch with what their customers want in a lightweight, high-performance laptop. I get not using the latest Intel chips (last year) due to production delays, but will they recover this year? I can’t see replacing hundreds of dollars of perfectly valid USB 3.x devices because of a “fashion statement,” either. If I didn’t use my Air to back up my phone and iPad, I could probably sell it and never look [back]. It’s sad, really, that Microsoft is trouncing Apple in their former strong suit!</p>

<p>Relax, Google and Apple. Nothing to fear from a company that can never deliver hardware that works right out of the box, or [one that] constantly delivers software/updates that brick your computer.</p>

<p>Hey Apple! Listen to your customers. We love the Air, but you have not done any real upgrades since 2016, except for [adding] more RAM. You can’t afford to lose this part of the market, especially students. Pros are too expensive, and the 12-inch is also too expensive. Also, the MacBook pro keyboard is terrible—too flat. You need a $1K laptop, period!</p>

<p>I think the article missed an important feature of this new device: [the] touch screen. Nothing in Apple’s current stable is close… Apple has not put out anything cool since Mr. Jobs’ passing. Sad. I am not an Apple fan, but [the company] used to raise the bar, making everyone try harder. And that Surface Studio! Wow, talk about understanding what is needed and nailing it.</p>

<p>Beware of Microsoft sales reps bearing gifts. The annual fees and lock-in don’t come cheap.</p>
