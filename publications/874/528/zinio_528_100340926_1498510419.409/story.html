    </div><h3><b>COMPUTEX TAIPEI</b></h3><p><b>I</b>n 2017, the organizers of the Computex trade show in Taipei—the second biggest one in the world for tech, apart from the CES bombast in Las Vegas every January—refocused the annual show on several new axes: among them were IoT, cloud services, gaming, and VR. The last two fields are tied closely, of course, to core changes in the PC-component ecosystem. That’s why we go to Computex every year, and boy, 2017’s show delivered on that front.</p>
<p>Computex is always a showcase for the best new PC tech coming out of Taiwan’s major PC players, as well as major core-tech anchors such as Intel and Nvidia. And Asus, Acer, MSI, and others showed off impressive new products, from budget 2-in-1s to lots of powerhouse gaming laptops. Asus in particular announced a massive collection of new devices, most of them slimmer and lighter than ever.</p>
<p>Chip giant Intel took the wraps off what look like its most powerful consumer-accessible PC processors ever, in the Intel Core X lineup. The nine new CPUs top out with the Core i9-7980XE, an 18-core, 36-thread monster. This was an obvious answer to AMD’s impressive Ryzen CPU launch earlier in 2017, and the imminent Threadripper/X399 platform, which AMD says will include a 16-core, 32-thread CPU to arrive sometime this summer.</p>
<p>Nvidia started off the show not by announcing new GPUs but instead revealing a more efficient “Max-Q” technology to leverage its existing “Pascal” chips for laptops. The most impressive of the new Max-Q laptops we saw at the show was the Asus ROG Zephyrus, a GTX 1080/Core i7 system that’s well under an inch thick and weighs less than 5 pounds. And while there were no new graphics chips launched at the show, we were impressed by the Zotac GeForce GTX 1080 Ti Mini, a powerhouse card that’s just over 8 inches long—and overclocked!</p>
<p>But that’s just the crest of the Computex product wave. Here are some of the best products we saw at the show this year.</p>

    </div><h3><b>BEST NEW GAMING LAPTOP:</b><b>Asus ROG Zephyrus</b></h3><p>There’s no denying Asus’ ROG Zephyrus has some design quirks, like its keyboard and touch-pad placement. But the company worked with Nvidia and its new Max-Q initiative to squeeze GeForce GTX 1080 graphics, a 7th Generation “Kaby Lake” processor, and a high-refresh-rate screen into a device that’s just 0.74 inch thick and 4.85 pounds. That’s impressive from an engineering standpoint alone, but we also like the way the laptop looks, with its straight lines and copper edge accents. The hinge, notably, is tied into the ventilation system, with the vents at the back opening wider when you lift the lid. This may be the most interesting new laptop we saw, period. It’s going to be expensive with a GTX 1080 at $2,699. But if you’re willing to step down to a GTX 1070 model, Asus says that version should run $2,299.</p>

    </div><h3><b>BEST NEW MAINSTREAM OR BUDGET DESKTOP:</b><b>Dell Inspiron 27 7000 AIO</b></h3><p>Dell has had an increased presence at Computex over the last few years, and it used the 2017 show as a platform to launch a very special all-in-one PC. It’s not special because of the design, though it is quite sleek; it’s special because it’s built wholly around AMD core CPU/GPU components—and it’s not a bare-budget play but a power machine. The Inspiron 27 7000 will be available in a number of configurations around full desktop AMD Ryzen processors and Radeon RX 500 graphics, topping out at the RX 580. With an RX 580 inside, this AIO will be well capable of powering virtual-reality headsets.</p>

    </div><h3><b>BEST NEW GAMING DESKTOP:</b><b>Zotac Mek</b></h3><p>Look out, Tiki; look out, Predator; you’re up against a mech now. Along the same size lines as the Predator G1 or Falcon Northwest Tiki, the Zotac Mek goes for a Tron-like minimalist-cool design and leverages the company’s strong position in small video cards. Zotac has pushed out Mini versions of most of the GeForce GTX 1000-series “Pascal” cards, and the company says the Mek should debut with a GTX 1080 plus a Core i7-7700 desktop chip, quite the power pair. A 450-watt power supply and a PCI Express NVMe SSD boot drive complete the config, and it will come in black or white with LED strips down the front. Unlike many of the company’s Zbox PCs, which tend to ship bare-bones with some parts left to you to supply, these will be fully configured PCs. No pricing or availability yet, but this Mek looks ready to do some hurtin’.</p>

    </div><h3><b>BEST NEW MAINSTREAM/BUDGET LAPTOP OR 2-IN-1:</b><b>Acer Spin 1</b></h3><p>The Spin 1 is a 2-in-1 rotating convertible that is all about the numbers: 1080p, 11.6-inch, 0.55-inch, $329. Well, it’s also about build quality. For a laptop this inexpensive, it impressed us with a nifty metal body. At a 0.55-inch thickness, this is a lean machine for such a low price, and it weighs just shy of 2.8 pounds. The 11.6-inch IPS (in-plane switching) panel provides fine viewing at any angle. The unit’s base specs are modest but in keeping with the price. Pentium or Celeron chips will be the order of the day, along with 4GB of RAM and eMMC storage (at 32GB, 64GB, or 128GB). We’d estimate the $329 config would be a 4GB/Celeron/32GB model, but we’ll have to wait and see. You also get two USB 3.0 ports, plus an HDMI out. Availability by midyear was Acer’s latest projection.</p>

    </div><h3><b>BEST NEW TABLET OR 2-IN-1:</b><b>Asus ZenBook Flip S</b></h3><p>Asus Chairman Jonney Shih came out swinging with the first major laptop announcement of Computex 2017: a wildly skinny 2-in-1, 360-degree convertible. And the ZenBook Flip S features—surprise, surprise!—support for up to a Core i7 U-series processor. Why that matters: The chassis, Asus claims, is the thinnest of any Core-based 2-in-1. The rotating hinge on most convertible laptops of this kind make these machines thick by nature. Here, though, the laptop is just 10.9mm thick (well under half an inch!) and weighs just 2.4 pounds. It’s done up in milled aluminum and in a choice of blue or grey.</p>
