    </div><h3><b>FELIK</b></h3><p><b>This artificially intelligent toy keeps your pets busy when you can’t. From its perch on the wall or countertop, Felik monitors the room for movement and uses an infrared-sensitive camera to track your cat or dog. Its AI predicts predatory activity (it knows when the animal is about to pounce) and prepares to react appropriately. The real selling point is Felik’s ability to behave naturally, moving the laser to simulate actual prey rather than in the random directions humans typically aim.</b></p>

    </div><h3><b>BIKI</b></h3><p><b>The unmanned underwater vehicle (UUV), aka the “world’s first bionic robot fish,” was designed with advanced bionics tech developed for arctic research. Boasting automated balance, obstacle avoidance, and a 4K camera, the fish-like device lets you “visualize the underwater world from a completely new perspective.” It offers 90 to 120 minutes of video capture at depths up to 196 feet. Moving at only 1.12 mph, BIKI looks and acts like seafood. But instead of gills, it had a 150-degree wide-angle, 4K camera lens, able to capture videos and photos with the press of a remote button.</b></p>

    </div><h3><b>RIVE</b></h3><p><b>Tyler Nathan, CEO of RiVE, wants to make driving safer for everyone with a new set of hardware and software that “eliminates the driver’s physical interaction with the phone.” Simply plug the device into your dashboard USB hub and attach the charging clip to your handset, physically blocking the home button; an accompanying app holds all notifications while the vehicle is in use. RiVE still allows access to music, maps, contacts, and 911; the system aims to prevent distractions from popping up on screen.</b></p>
