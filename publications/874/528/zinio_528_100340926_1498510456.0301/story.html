    </div><p><b>H</b>TC’s passion for sound has come through in its phones for years, and I hear it again in the U11 for Sprint, a shimmery slab of audio excellence. There’s a lot more going on with the U11, however. It’s also the first U.S. phone with always-on Alexa support, and it’s potentially Sprint’s fastest LTE phone yet. But if you’re going to pick one reason to buy it right now, it’s the sound. Otherwise, the Galaxy S8 remains a slightly more well-rounded device and our Editors’ Choice.</p>

    </div><h3><b>MODELS AND DESIGN</b></h3><p>HTC offers two U11 models: one for Sprint and an unlocked model (available for $649 from <a href="http://HTC.com" target="_self">HTC.com</a>) that will work on the three other major U.S. carriers. We reviewed the Sprint unit. Many of the other reviews you see out there will be for the unlocked unit, which has slightly different firmware.</p>
<p>The first thing you notice about the phone is the design. The U11 is gorgeous. It comes in black or silver, but the color you really want is the deep, automotive-paint blue. There’s a big price to pay for the baked-in, unscratchable color, though: The phone is a fingerprint magnet, and it’ll be perpetually greasy unless you go for a (clear, please) case.</p>
<p>I’ve been very spoiled by narrow phones such as the Samsung Galaxy S8, the LG G6, and the BlackBerry KeyOne recently. At 6.07 by 2.99 by 0.31 inches and 5.96 ounces, the U11 is a standard size for a 16:9, 5.5-inch phone, but it still feels too wide in my hand. The sleek back turns slippery quickly, and especially when you’re trying to squeeze the edges of the phone, it feels like you can drop it.</p>
<p>The 2,560-by-1,440 Super LCD 5 is visible outdoors and in and looks razor sharp. Below it is a fingerprint sensor/home button flanked by two fixed, capacitive keys. On the sides of the phone, invisible, is the innovative “squeeze” section, a pressure sensor that can launch the camera, flashlight, or any other app.</p>
<p>The phone is IP67 water-resistant, which means it can be dunked in up to three feet of water for 30 minutes. HTC’s previous generations of phones weren’t water-resistant, but competing flagships from other manufacturers tend to be now.</p>

    </div><h3><b>HTC U11</b></h3><p><b>PROS Excellent audio quality. Useful squeeze sensor. Gigabit LTE. Fast processor. Alexa compatible.</b></p>
<p><b>CONS Camera doesn’t measure up to its marketing. No headphone jack. Back panel attracts fingerprints.</b></p>
<h3><b>SHIMMERY AND GORGEOUS</b></h3><p><b>The U11 comes in black or silver, but the color you really want is the deep, automotive-paint blue.</b></p>
<p class="pullQuote"><b>You’ll find a dramatic improvement in Sprint coverage in weak signal situations when you compare the U11 with older phones.</b></p>
<h3><b>NETWORKING AND BATTERY</b></h3><p>The U11 is billed as Sprint’s first gigabit LTE phone. It’s the first phone with 4x4 MIMO on Sprint’s Band 41, completing the trio of technologies that should allow it to get the fastest possible speeds on Sprint’s network. We tested it against a Samsung Galaxy S8 using our field test software, though, and didn’t see the difference, at least not yet. Comparing three locations with good Sprint signal in Manhattan, we got an average of 29.2Mbps down on the S8 as compared with 23.6Mbps on the U11.</p>
<p>That said, you’ll find a dramatic improvement in Sprint coverage in weak signal situations when you compare the U11 with older phones. The U11, like the Galaxy S8 and LG G6, has HPUE (high performance user equipment), which we’ve seen improve Sprint signal in several different tests.</p>
<p>Performance on other U.S. carriers with the unlocked model should be very good but will probably fall short of the Galaxy S7 and S8, as the U11 lacks the 4x4 MIMO antennas for other carriers’ bands. It has all of the bands T-Mobile and Verizon use, but it lacks AT&amp;T’s supplementary bands 29 and 30, which help in high-traffic areas.</p>
<p>Battery life on the 3,000mAh cell was good, at seven hours and one minute of LTE video streaming with the screen on full brightness. The phone supports Qualcomm’s Quick Charge technology but not wireless charging.</p>

    </div><h3><b>ANDROID AND PERFORMANCE</b></h3><p>The U11 runs Android 7.1 with HTC’s relatively aggressive skin. The skin doesn’t hold back performance: With the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor platform on board, we got absolutely terrific benchmark scores and all-around smooth performance. The phone has 64GB of storage, 11.54GB of which is taken up by system files, plus room for a microSD card in the nano SIM card slot.</p>
<p>The most exciting new feature, of course, is the squeeze sensor, which HTC calls Edge Sense. A sensor area about two-thirds of the way down the sides of the phone can be calibrated to your liking when you set the phone up. Then when you squeeze it, it’ll launch the camera or the flashlight. The sensor is completely customizable—you can actually use it to launch any app, and HTC says it will release an app that lets the Edge Sense hook into other apps on your phone, as a click action within the apps.</p>
<p>Yes, it’s a gimmick. It’s not going to change your life. But it’s a useful gimmick, much like Motorola’s twist-to-camera feature. I ended up using it less than I thought I would, though, because I found the U11 to be a little uncomfortably wide to securely grip and squeeze in my hand. Folks with larger hands will likely get more use out of it.</p>
<p>HTC’s most imposing change is to put NewsRepublic news headlines on your lock screen. Turn it off, and you’ll still get aggressive NewsRepublic alerts in your notifications. Fortunately, you can disable NewsRepublic entirely. You’ll still see news headlines in Blinkfeed, the Flipboard-like page found to the left of the main home screen.</p>
<p>There’s also the mystery that is HTC’s Sense Companion. It’s supposed to suggest local attractions to you, and things like when to recharge your phone, but I didn’t get any suggestions from it during my test period. It may simply need more time to work.</p>
<p>Other bloatware on the phone: UA Record, a fitness app that’s part of HTC’s deal with UnderArmour; Viveport, HTC and Valve’s VR app store; Boost, a memory optimization app; and HTC’s Zoe video editor. In general, though, HTC managed to hold off from adding too many redundant apps. The browser is Chrome, the photo app is Google Photos, and the music app is Google Play Music.</p>
<p class="pullQuote"><b>The most exciting new feature, of course, is the squeeze sensor, which HTC calls Edge Sense.</b></p>
<h3><b>HEY, ALEXA!</b></h3><p>One of the U11’s most interesting features cannot be tested right now: It’s the first “dual wake word” phone. That means you can say “OK Google” to get the Google Assistant or “Alexa” to wake up Amazon’s voice assistant. You can even switch back and forth, query by query, depending on which one tends to give the best responses.</p>
<p>This isn’t a mandatory feature. Alexa will be a downloadable add-on you’ll be able to get later this summer. And HTC has some potential kinks to work out: You’ll probably have to set all of your Amazon Echo devices to a different wake word, or the phone and your Echos will fight over your query.</p>
<p>But with the growing popularity of Alexa, it’s worth keeping an eye out for this feature. No other carrier-sold phone in the U.S. lets you holler “Alexa!” to wake up Amazon’s assistant. And for what it’s worth, “OK Google” works fine, just as it does on other leading Android phones.</p>

    </div><h3><b>A SOUND CHOICE</b></h3><p><b>The HTC U11 for Sprint is the best music phone around, and its unusual squeeze sensor is a fun new way to interact with a mobile device. It features Gigabit LTE and a fast processor, and it’s Alexa-compatible.</b></p>
<h3><b>A MARVELOUS MUSIC PHONE</b></h3><p>The U11 is the best music phone we’ve tested. Start with the speakers. In speakerphone or music playback mode, HTC uses a speaker on top as a “tweeter,” while the main speaker, on the bottom, is a more powerful “woofer.” The top speaker basically offers a little bit of high-end enhancement, but the overall effect is more than the sum of its parts—a noticeably richer sound than on most other phones.</p>
<p>The included earbuds are a treat. HTC includes special Usonic USB-C earphones that work only with this phone. They use a sonar-like technology to map your hearing and equalize the phone’s sound to compensate. It’s an especially effective technology for older ears like mine: With Usonic, I got to hear a lot more high-end than I usually do, because that part of my hearing is shot. The earbuds also do a little bit of active noise cancellation when they’re playing music, but it isn’t active when music isn’t playing.</p>
<p>The U11 has no headphone jack, but HTC supplies a special dongle with a DAC (digital to analog converter) inside. Paired with super-high-end headphones, I could hear the difference when compared with the otherwise excellent Galaxy S8: The U11 has more detailed highs, better texture and shape to sound, and longer decay. This is the first convincing argument I’ve heard for using a dongle.</p>
<p>One exception to the U11’s audio excellence is that if you rely on wireless headphones, the phone doesn’t stand apart. It’s even a step behind the Galaxy S8. With Bluetooth 4.2 rather than Bluetooth 5.0, it can’t do the new trick of playing to two sets of headphones at once, and the sound quality of Bluetooth audio is dependent on the encoding scheme, not the phone’s own amp.</p>

    </div><h3><b>PHOTO PROOF</b></h3><p><b>People may be a little skeptical considering HTC’s heavy photo focus in its marketing, but the proof is in the images above. The left one was taken with the U11, the right one with the S8.</b></p>
<h3><b>PHOTOS AND VIDEOS</b></h3><p>The U11 has a 16-megapixel front-facing camera and a 12-megapixel rear camera. The phone records “3D audio” surround stereo using its four microphones.</p>
<p>Still-camera quality wasn’t quite up to the fearsome standards of the Galaxy S8 in testing. This is an area in which my results differ from other early reviews, and the difference may be that my phone is using Sprint firmware while other reviewers are using international units. HTC told me that the international models have a newer version of the camera software than the Sprint units do.</p>
<p>That said, the U11 took slightly washed-out photos in which the blacks weren’t as deep and true as on the S8. In low light, the U11 managed to eke images out of even very dark surroundings, but at the cost of some blur and precision.</p>
<p>The front-facing camera gave me a lot of pixels, but in dimly lit scenarios, the images were aggressively filtered and sharpened. HTC says camera upgrades will come.</p>
<p>Video recording tested better than still photos. Videos in both 1080p and 4K were smooth and clear, and stabilization is available on the 1080p clips.</p>
<p class="pullQuote"><b>We’ll take another look in the months ahead to see whether this promising phone evolves into a winner.</b></p>
<h3><b>CONCLUSIONS</b></h3><p>HTC has spun out a confusing and unconvincing set of phones so far this year. Seeing the U11, which is clearly HTC’s flagship, I wonder why the HTC U Ultra and HTC U Play came out at all—although they didn’t fully come out in the U.S., as neither phone got official carrier support.</p>
<p>Also, the HTC U11 has a lot of unrealized promise—features we couldn’t quite test. Alexa integration, for instance, sounds great but isn’t here yet. Sense Companion doesn’t seem to do much. Gigabit LTE could pull the U11 ahead on network speeds later this year. And HTC is promising camera software upgrades to fix the image issues we saw during testing.</p>
<p>The U11 is the best competition for the Galaxy S8 on Sprint. We’re going to keep our Editors’ Choice with the S8 for its superior camera and network performance in our tests; even though the U11’s spec sheet says differently, we have to go by our results. But while the U11 doesn’t outpace the S8, I’d suggest it to audiophiles for whom music and speakerphone are primary uses. We’ll take another look in the months ahead to see whether this promising phone evolves into a winner.</p>
