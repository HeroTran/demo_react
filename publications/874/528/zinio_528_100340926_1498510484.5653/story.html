    </div><p><b>T</b>he Samsung Galaxy Book is a 2-in-1 detachable-hybrid tablet running Windows 10. It’s Samsung’s answer to the Microsoft Surface Pro 4, our current top pick. Because of their included hardware keyboards, 2-in-1 laptops are better bets for productivity than slate tablets. (Ever tried editing a long Word document on an iPad?) The Galaxy Book packs a brilliant Super AMOLED screen, LTE connectivity, and an impressive 14 hours of battery life, which help it stand out in a crowded field. The downside: You get only 4GB of RAM and a 128GB SSD, and at this price, you should get at least double that.</p>

    </div><h3><b>THE SCREEN IS THE STAR</b></h3><p>The Galaxy Book’s 12-inch touch-enabled 2,160-by-1,440-resolution Super AMOLED display very well may be the main reason to buy this tablet. Images are crystal clear, and colors pop. The screen is accurate and a good match when you use programs such as Adobe Lightroom CC for organizing and proofing photos. The display on the Galaxy Book looks brighter, has better black levels, and shows more details than the In-Plane Switching (IPS) displays on the Huawei MateBook and Surface Pro 4.</p>
<p>Bundled with the Galaxy Book is Samsung’s excellent S Pen stylus. The size and shape of a regular ink pen, it has 4,096 levels of pressure sensitivity, and it doesn’t need an AAAA battery like the Surface Pen or to be periodically charged like the Apple Pencil. The stylus supports Windows Ink and full-brush tilting in programs such as Adobe Photoshop, which makes it a useful tool for digital artists.</p>
<p>The pen is responsive in use, but because it is passive, it functions a little differently than active styli, including the Surface Pen and the Active Pen for the Lenovo Miix 510. A button on the side of the S Pen controls erase functions, but it has no right-click or shortcut options, both of which would require powered Bluetooth. The side button also invokes Air Command, Samsung’s overlay that acts as an alternative to Windows Ink. Air Command lets you use the pen to mark up the screen and create sticky notes.</p>
<p>The S Pen comes with a plastic loop that sticks to the keyboard cover for storage. It seems secure, though I’m not sure how long the adhesive will last before the pen loop falls off. I prefer the way the Surface Pen sticks to the side of the Surface Pro 4 or the Surface Book with magnets, or the combination of magnets and a tether line used by the Dell Latitude 5285 2-in-1.</p>
<p>The tablet’s 5-megapixel webcam is fine for selfies and Skype calls, and the 13MP rear-facing camera is adequate for snapshots, although it could use a flash for low-light shots. Stereo speakers vent out of the left and right sides of the tablet and can fill a small- to medium-size room with sound. You’ll hear more treble than bass, but that’s not uncommon for tablets and ultraportable laptops.</p>

    </div><h3><b>S PEN</b></h3><p><b>It’s the shape of a regular ink pen and doesn’t need an AAAA battery or to be charged, as competitors do.</b></p>
<h3><b>KEYBOARD INCLUDED</b></h3><p>Detachable hybrid tablets like the Galaxy Book give you the option of using a lighter slate-like tablet when you want to sketch a quick drawing or read an ebook, but they also let you clip on a keyboard when you need to type more than 140 characters. Unlike the Apple iPad Pro and the Surface Pro, the Galaxy Book is bundled with a keyboard case. The keyboard is a must for working in a desktop operating system such as Windows 10.</p>
<p>The keyboard has a magnetic stand that clips on to the back of the tablet and gives you four usable angles, from near flat to standing straight up. It works well but is ultimately less convenient than the continuously variable angle available from kickstands on the Dell Latitude 5285 2-in-1, the HP Spectre x2, the Lenovo Miix 510, or the Surface Pro. The omission keeps the tablet slim at 7.87 by 11.47 by 0.29 inches (HWD), and light (1.66 pounds; 2.57 pounds with the case). But this also means you’ll need to carry the case with you, since the tablet can’t stand up on its own.</p>
<p>The backlit keyboard built into the case is comfortable to use, with a full keystroke, but it flexes when you press hard on the keys around its midsection. (That’s pretty common among keyboard covers, with the exception of the metal-bound keyboard case on the HP Spectre x2.) The one-piece touchpad is smooth and reacts quickly to inputs. It doesn’t have a two-stage latch, so you can’t tilt the keyboard as you can on the Surface Pro and most competitors.</p>

    </div><h3><b>QUITE ADAPTABLE</b></h3><p><b>Detachable-hybrid tablets like the Galaxy Book let you clip on a keyboard when you need to type more than 140 characters.</b></p>
<h3><b>SPARSE (BUT SMART) CONNECTIVITY</b></h3><p>The Galaxy Book has two USB-C ports on its right side, double the number found on the Samsung Galaxy TabPro S and the Huawei MateBook. That’s important, because it means there’s a free port when you’re charging the tablet with the included USB-C cable and quick charger. The only other I/O port is a headset jack, also on the right side. Notably, the Galaxy Book doesn’t come with a USB-C-to-Type-A adapter, which is included with the HP Spectre x2.</p>
<p>Even though you can buy one for less than $10 on Amazon, the omission is disappointing, considering that the system costs $1,300. You’ll need this adapter to connect older hard drives, flash drives, and other peripherals.</p>

    </div><p>Wireless is handled by 802.11ac Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4.1, and there’s also a 4G LTE radio in this Verizon-exclusive model for always-available connectivity. You’ll need to sign up for an LTE data plan, but that’s easily done online or in person at a Verizon store. You can easily switch between Wi-Fi and 4G LTE networks when you’re in range of a hotspot. LTE is an option in tablets including the HP Spectre x2 and the upcoming 2017 version of the Microsoft Surface Pro but not in the Surface Pro 4.</p>
<h3><b>SHORT ON STORAGE, MEMORY, SECURITY</b></h3><p>The $1,129.99 base model and the LTE-equipped version of the Galaxy Book come with 4GB of RAM and a 128GB SSD. While that’s usable, a Windows 10 tablet should really come with 8GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD, especially at this price. You can purchase a version of the tablet with those specs for $1,329.99, but you won’t get an LTE radio. The Surface Pro 4 comes with 8GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD for $1,299, though you’ll have to purchase its $129 Type Cover separately. The main concern is that you can’t upgrade the memory post-purchase, so you’re stuck with what you get when you open the box. On the bright side, the Galaxy Book, the HP Spectre x2, and the Surface Pro 4 all give you the option of adding up to 256GB of storage with a microSD card (in the case of the Galaxy Book, the card slot on the left side).</p>
<p>Security features are lacking compared with similar models. Many high-end tablets come with Windows Hello (including the Dell Latitude 5285), which uses an IR Camera to log you in without a password, or a fingerprint reader (the Huawei MateBook), or both (the Microsoft Surface Pro 4). The Galaxy Book supports neither of these biometric-based security features. Instead, it comes with Samsung Flow, which lets you log into your tablet using the fingerprint reader on your Samsung Galaxy phone. The catch is it won’t work if you use another brand of Android phone or an Apple iPhone. Samsung covers the Galaxy Book with a one-year warranty.</p>

<h3><b>DECENT PERFORMANCE, FORMIDABLE BATTERY LIFE</b></h3><p>Under the hood is an Intel Core i5-7200U processor with integrated Intel HD 620 graphics, which helped the Galaxy Book eke out a win over the Surface Pro 4 on the PCMark 8 Work Conventional (2,906 points), Handbrake (2:16), and CineBench (318 points) tests. The Dell Latitude 5285 was the overall winner on these three tests, thanks to its faster Core i7 processor. The Surface Pro 4 aced Photoshop test with the Galaxy Book coming in a distant third (4:07). The Galaxy Book, the Latitude 5285, and the Surface Pro 4 were faster across the multimedia tests than the HP Spectre x2 and Huawei MateBook, both of which use low-powered Core m processors. None of these tablets produced playable scores on our 3D gaming tests, though the Latitude 5285 came the closest.</p>
<p>At 14 hours, 6 minutes, the Galaxy Book excelled on our battery rundown test, outlasting the Latitude 5285 (11:09), the Surface Pro 4 (10:19), the Spectre x2 (9:38), and the Huawei Matebook (6:19). With a fully charged battery, you can watch locally stored movies on the Galaxy Book for an entire trans-Pacific flight from San Francisco to the Philippines. Using the Wi-Fi or the 4G LTE connections will sap the battery faster, but it’s fair to say that the Galaxy Book will make a good travel companion if you’re going to be away from a power plug for an extended period of time.</p>
