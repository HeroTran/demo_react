    </div><p><b>S</b>ure, you can always hold your phone up to someone’s face to show them snapshots of your baby niece. But you can’t really mount your phone on a wall or stash it in your wallet for anytime viewing of a favorite shot. Even though it seems like we’ve moved past printed matter, printing your most prized photos still has value, and there are plenty of services that can do it for you.</p>
<p>Here’s what you should consider when you need to create physical mementos from your digital memories.</p>
<h3><b>FIRST AND FOREMOST: PRICING</b></h3><p>It turns out that you can get hardcopy keepsakes of your visual memories without breaking the bank. Some services we tested, including Snapfish and York Photo Labs, produce 4-by-6-inch prints for just 9 cents apiece, and those two services have offers that get you the first 100 and 20 prints free, respectively, not including tax and shipping. Surprisingly, Walgreens Photo is the most expensive service when it comes to 4-by-6 prints, charging 29 cents each. But you pay for the convenience of local pickup, and after 50 prints, that price drops to 20 cents per 4-by-6. The next-priciest 4-by-6 photos among the services we tested were from Nations Photo Labs, at 27 cents each, but the company provided the best image quality and paper. In the middle is Shutterfly’s 15-cent 4-by-6 prints.</p>
<p>Even when you want enlargements at popular sizes such as 5-by-7 and 8-by-10, you don’t have to spend a lot. Snapfish offers 5-by-7 prints for just 69 cents each, and Nations Photo Labs produces excellent-quality 8-by-10 photos for a mere $1.90 each. That’s the best price we found for 8-by-10 prints; most competitors charge a still-reasonable $2.99 to $3.99. For wall-art size prints, of course, you’ll pay more, but it’s still not exorbitant: All of the services sell 16-by-20 prints for under $20, and most charge closer to $15.</p>
<h3><b>PLASTER YOUR PICTURES ANYWHERE</b></h3><p>Why stop at ordinary photo prints when you can have your pictures grace mugs, playing cards, and even pillows? The services reviewed here offer a remarkable assortment of objects that you can personalize. All offer greeting cards, calendars, and photo books. Most offer phone cases, blankets, and drinkware. Shutterfly offers the largest selection of photo gifts, including flower pots, blankets, phone cases, pillows, shower curtains, and even pet-food bowls. But York Photo Labs is the only service we found that can sell you a necktie featuring your picture.</p>
<h3><b>EDITING, ORDERING, AND SHARING</b></h3><p>When you’re ordering photos online, it helps if the service has a friendly, navigable website. For example, most services, including Snapfish, let you simply check off all the sizes you want on a single-page grid. Others make you select a size for printing before choosing the images you want; you then must start over again if you want prints in other sizes.</p>
<p>The services offer good photo-editing tools, letting you brighten or darken an underexposed or overexposed shot, for example. Many services automatically apply color correction. Nations Photo Labs offers high-level photo editing for a price premium, but we didn’t see a big difference in our test prints between premium color-corrections and standard prints.</p>
<p>Online sharing is offered by some services, and Shutterfly is particularly strong in this capability, even letting you create online mini-websites for your photos. Snapfish and Walgreens Photo let you share online galleries that can be viewed as full-window slideshows. York Photos shared galleries are little more than batches of thumbnails, and Nations Photo Lab doesn’t get involved in online gallery sharing.</p>
<h3><b>MOBILE APPS</b></h3><p>The most popular camera these days is one that’s always with you: your phone. And smartphones have come a long way in terms of image quality; some capture images with more than 20 megapixels of resolution. With most photos now being taken by phones, it only makes sense for a photo printing service to offer a mobile app to get the images straight from your phone to the print service. York offers a very basic app that lets you only upload and order prints. Shutterfly adds the ability to order photo gifts, and Snapfish and Walgreens Photo’s apps can import photos from social networks, perform some editing, and share photos with friends. Nations is the only service in this group with no mobile app.</p>

    </div><h3><b>DELIVERY</b></h3><p>When you want your pictures pronto, Walgreens Photo is the way to go. (Look for upcoming reviews of Walmart Photo and CVS Photo, which also let you pick up prints locally.) In our testing, Walgreens Photo didn’t provide the best enlargements in terms of image quality, but its smaller prints were perfectly acceptable.</p>
<p class="pullQuote"><b>With most photos now being taken by phones, it only makes sense for a photo printing service to offer a mobile app.</b></p>
<p>When you can wait a few days or you want special options not available with local pickup, such as matte finish, mail order is provided by all the services tested. None of them took an inordinate amount of time, and shipping costs for our order of 22 photos of various sizes ranged from $2.34 for York Photo Labs to $7 for Nations Photo Lab—but the reason for the difference was stark. York packaged the photos in a thin, standard large envelope, while the carefully protected Nations order arrived in multiple layers of cardboard and clear plastic envelopes.</p>
<p>Need faster delivery? Most services offer second-day and overnight shipping, but keep in mind that the products still have to be produced, so that doesn’t mean your photos will arrive the day after you order them, necessarily, even if you pay the $15 for overnight shipping. But it may mean your pictures arrive four days earlier. In practice, none of our test orders, for which we used the lowest-cost shipping options, took more than five days to arrive.</p>
<h3><b>PRINT QUALITY</b></h3><p>For us, this is the most important factor when ordering prints: how accurately the photos reproduce the images you shot. Most of the prints I received, especially at the smaller 4-by-6-inch size, revealed acceptable image quality. When you get to enlargements, however, the differences became far more apparent. In particular, we found that the Walgreens Photo prints exhibited discoloration and lost detail, while the Nations Photo Lab prints showed the best image quality. In one mountain photograph we had printed, the sky in the Walgreens Photo picture had a pinkish and purplish tinge that wasn’t in the original, and some cloud detail was lost to white.</p>
<p>Images from Nations Photo Lab, on the other hand, looked natural and showed the truest black in a portrait with a black backdrop. Nations is also the only service that uses the truly professional-quality Kodak Endura paper.</p>
<p>Here are our evaluations of five photo services. (Prices are for one 4-by-6 print.)</p>

    </div><p>You might think there’s no difference between the two big names in online photo-print ordering services, Snapfish and Shutterfly, but I was surprised and impressed at the striking difference. Snapfish not only uses a more modern and powerful web interface, it also delivers better-looking images at lower prices. In fact, its prices were the lowest among the services I tested, and you even get the first 100 4-by-6 prints free. For value and website design, Snapfish earns our Editors’ Choice, but the slightly more expensive Nations Photo Lab, also an Editor’s Choice, offers slightly better image quality and packaging.</p>

Not only did my test prints reveal the best overall image quality, but they were shipped in the most protective packaging. And pricing is very reasonable. Nations Photo Labs is PCMag’s Editors’ Choice for photo printing services for its top image quality, joining Snapfish, which is our top pick for best value in the category.</p>

Print and image quality is average, pricing is average, and the website experience is neither wonderful nor terrible. The feathers: Packaging is excellent, online galleries are shareable, and the service prints the filename or photo title on the back of photos. If those things are paramount to you, then Shutterfly is worth a look. For the best image quality, however, look to Nations Photo Lab, and for the best value, look to Snapfish.</p>
