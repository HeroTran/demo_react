    </div><p><b>W</b>as anyone surprised that Google’s AlphaGo program, developed as part of its DeepMind operation, defeated the world’s best go player? IBM’s Deep Blue beat Garry Kasparov, and Watson prevailed on <i>Jeopardy!</i> It’s time we stopped pitting computers against people; there’s no point.</p>
<p>It’s great that one computer can house the entire Library of Congress. But until an artificial intelligence system can synthesize an actual new idea from the knowledge contained in those books, these machines are still nothing more than grandiose, soulless adding machines.</p>
<p>Now that doesn’t mean the game-playing machines can’t provide interesting entertainment, especially if you rethink playing the games and add some new twists. We already have computer programs that can play bridge, for example. Step it up by having them face off against bridge superfans Bill Gates and Warren Buffett. This twosome would love to take on this challenge and might even finance the whole thing. Bridge-playing computers win a lot of championships and would probably beat Gates and Buffett. Let’s find out.</p>
<p>Computer versus man chess matches go back to the 1950s. It has improved the programs over time, but how about someone laying down a cool $1 million and having computers play against computers? Anyone who likes chess would love to see how new strategies might evolve.</p>
<p>Man versus machine is fun but futile and proves nothing. There have been computer versus computer showdowns, but not with big stakes; not enough to encourage new developments. How about machine versus machine in other arenas? If Watson is so smart, could it play the game of go against the Google machine? I’d love to see how that showdown goes. How about Watson versus Deep Blue?</p>
<p>The games would be played at breakneck speed; thousands might be played in a few minutes and end up in all stalemates. Final matches between two fabulous chess-playing machines might run for months before a victor appeared. Then what would happen if you had to win two out of three? I think a lot of people would find this a lot more interesting than computers versus humans, over and over.</p>
