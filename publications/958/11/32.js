considered complete without including Stephen Colbert’s performance at the 2006 White House Correspondents’ Dinner (<i>The Wildest, Craziest, Most Offensive and Fucked-Up Jokes Ever Told,</i> July/ August). Colbert walked into the monster’s lair, looked George W. Bush in the eyes and mercilessly attacked him to his face. By doing so he let the entire world know what many of us believed: that the uncomfortable-looking man with the spurious smile on his face was destined to be remembered as the worst president in our lifetime. What Colbert did that night was not simply brave, it was historic.</p>\n<p><i>Leonard Stegmann</i></p>\n<p><i>Half Moon Bay, California</i></p>\n<h3><b> FULL STEAM AHEAD</b></h3><p>PLAYBOY’s new direction is impressive. So far every month has improved on the last, with the July/August Freedom Issue the very best so far. Continue like this and the brand will thrive.</p>\n<p><i>Pierre B. Gauthier</i></p>\n<p><i>Quebec City, Quebec</i></p>\n<h3><b> KICKING ASS AND GIVING NAMES</b></h3><p><i>Suicide Squad</i> actress Karen Fukuhara says, “It’s rare to see an Asian female take on the role of a badass” (<i>No Filter,</i> July/August). I guess she’s never heard of Michelle Yeoh and Zhang Ziyi (<i>Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon</i>), Maggie Q (<i>Nikita</i>), Grace Park (<i>Battlestar Galactica</i>), Lucy Liu (<i>Kill Bill, Charlie’s Angels</i>), Devon Aoki (<i>Sin City</i>) or Jamie Chung (<i>Sucker Punch</i>). It’s not so rare.</p>\n<p><i>M.J. Randle</i></p>\n<p><i>Dallas, Texas</i></p>\n<h3><b> ROUNDING THE BASES</b></h3><p>Thank you for the photos of Miss June Josie Canseco. Her beauty illustrates the superiority of the female sex. No tattoos, no piercings, just delicious woman. The photos are so much more exciting when they leave you begging for more.</p>\n<p><i>B. Wills</i></p>\n<p><i>Las Vegas, Nevada</i></p>\n<p><i>Josie does in fact have a couple of tiny tattoos. Here’s a fun project: Look again.</i></p>\n<p>Someone tell Jose Canseco that his daughter one-upped him: She hit a grand slam without ever stepping up to bat.</p>\n<p><i>Brendan O’Neal</i></p>\n<p><i>New Orleans, Louisiana</i></p>\n<h3><b> QUEEN EUGENA</b></h3><p>I’m thrilled with Eugena Washington, Hef’s choice for Playmate of the Year 2016 (June). Eugena is intelligent, ambitious, confident and gorgeous inside and out—essentially the embodiment of what Playmates have come to represent. She’s an impressive woman with so much to offer.</p>\n<p>Eugena’s win feels socially and culturally significant; the impact on those PLAYBOY has empowered with this choice will endure. Validation is important. The struggles to overcome racism and homophobia are similar; I understand the courage it takes to face a world that can be needlessly hateful. I see strength in Eugena’s eyes, and it reminds me to keep fighting for myself. She’s a symbol of possibility, living her life on her own terms with no apologies, doing what she loves. It’s beautiful to see.</p>\n<p><i>Josh Fehrens</i></p>\n<p><i>Toronto, Ontario</i></p>\n<h3><b> NEW SCHOOL OF ROCK</b></h3><p>Writer Sean Manning (<i>Radio on the TV,</i> June) is spot-on: Shows about the music industry are a key way to expose viewers to artists they wouldn’t hear otherwise, such as Lucius or Halsey. I work in the music department for Cameron Crowe’s <i>Roadies,</i> and “introducing audiences to new artists,” to use Manning’s wording, is a favorite part of my job<i>.</i> Everyone involved in the show truly loves music, and I think that comes across.</p>\n<p><i>Jessica Curtis</i></p>\n<p><i>Seattle, Washington</i></p>\n<h3><b> PREPARE TO BE ASSIMILATED</b></h3><p>Ray Kurzweil envisions everyone’s consciousness linked through technology (<i>Playboy Interview,</i> May). If I had a direct connection between my brain and a massive network, I would want a massive firewall—and other security measures.</p>\n<p><i>Steven Rovnyak</i></p>\n<p><i>Indianapolis, Indiana </i></p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_958/storage/images/media2/images/playboyintus1609_article_012_01_02/12254-1-eng-GB/playboyintus1609_article_012_01_022.jpg\" width=\"103\" height=\"125\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"playboyintus1609_article_012_01_02\" title=\"playboyintus1609_article_012_01_02\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b> WE FEIGGED UP</b></h3><p>Photographer Dan Monick took Paul Feig’s portrait for our July/ August feature on the director (<i>The Gospel According to Paul</i>), as well as the image at right.</p>\n<p> E-mail <a href=\"mailto:letters@playboy.com\" target=\"_self\">letters@playboy.com</a>, or write to us at</p>\n<p>9346 Civic Center Drive, Beverly Hills, California 90210.</p>\n","layout":{},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":0,"link_source":"","competition":[],"flatplan_title":"","notes":"","gutter_credit":"","other":"","image":[{"id":"zinio_playboyintus1609_article_012_01_image_0_1471453142.8675","name":"playboyintus1609_article_012_01_01","source":"TOP PHOTO BY JASON LEE PARRY","caption":"<p> All hail Eugena Washington, Playmate of the Year 2016.</p>\n","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_958/storage/images/media2/images/playboyintus1609_article_012_01_01/12261-1-eng-GB/playboyintus1609_article_012_01_012.jpg?t=default_ipad_portrait&ext/playboyintus1609_article_012_01_012_default_ipad_portrait.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"768","height":"796","legacy_id":"1336","is_default":true},{"id":"zinio_playboyintus1609_article_012_01_image_0_1471453142.8675","name":"playboyintus1609_article_012_01_01","source":"TOP PHOTO BY JASON LEE PARRY","caption":"<p> All hail Eugena Washington, Playmate of the Year 2016.</p>\n","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_958/storage/images/media2/images/playboyintus1609_article_012_01_01/12261-1-eng-GB/playboyintus1609_article_012_01_012.jpg?t=default_ipad_landscape&ext/playboyintus1609_article_012_01_012_default_ipad_landscape.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"741","height":"768","legacy_id":"1336","is_default":false}],"related_objects":{"image":[{"id":"zinio_playboyintus1609_article_012_01_image_1_1471453142.0776","name":"playboyintus1609_article_012_01_02","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_958/storage/images/media2/images/playboyintus1609_article_012_01_02/12254-1-eng-GB/playboyintus1609_article_012_01_022.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"103","height":"125","legacy_id":"1335"},{"id":"zinio_playboyintus1609_article_012_01_image_1_1471453142.0776","name":"playboyintus1609_article_012_01_02","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_958/storage/images/media2/images/playboyintus1609_article_012_01_02/12254-1-eng-GB/playboyintus1609_article_012_01_022.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"103","height":"125","legacy_id":"1335"}]},"url_alias":"http://site-958.audiencemedia.com","type":"story","order":"1","folio_number":"12","folio_numbers":"12","pdf_page_index":"12","thumbnail":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_958/storage/images/media2/images/playboyintus1609_article_012_01_01/12261-1-eng-GB/playboyintus1609_article_012_01_012.jpg?t=tablet_story_thumbnail&ext/playboyintus1609_article_012_01_012_tablet_story_thumbnail.jpg","color":"FFFFFF","real_id":"1334","main_section_id":"32","ads":[]}],"type":null,"ads":[]}}
