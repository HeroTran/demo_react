Planted in the middle of a rocky hill a few hundred yards south of the mud-walled compound where the Afghan commandos have taken shelter, the flag’s message is clear: ISIS is here, waiting.</p>\n<p>The mission of the commandos of Afghanistan’s First Platoon, First Special Operations Battalion is straightforward: Find the ISIS fighters and take them out. The soldiers are eager to take on an enemy that has killed many of their own, beheaded and blown up local villagers and driven countless people from their homes.</p>\n<p>Pakistan, the source of many of the foreign fighters, lies a few miles away, over the denuded chocolate-colored mountains that stair-step up from the hill to snowy peaks. Mud-brick compounds, abandoned when fighting escalated here in Afghanistan’s Nangarhar province last summer, dot the valley floor. There is no movement except for the flag’s whip. No farmers tilling their fields. No one walking. The stillness is unnerving.</p>\n<p>An order crackles over the radio: time to go. The soldiers move out across the rolling valley floor, searching one compound after another. To the west they can see their comrades from Third Platoon doing the same. The Afghan army and national border police are to follow behind, holding territory the commandos have secured.</p>\n<p>The goal is to clear out the extremists so that civilians can return to their homes. Tranquillity fled this region over the past year after ISIS fighters slithered in and embarked on a campaign of terror, executing locals they deemed impure and fighting pitched battles with the Taliban and anyone else in their way.</p>\n<p>The soldiers are picking their way through a stony field studded with poplar trees and dry grass that crunches underfoot when the first shots ring out from the hill. The commandos scatter, diving behind boulders and trees and firing back. Some sprint to a nearby compound and take shelter.</p>\n<p>It’s a lousy place to seek safety. The five-foot-high southern mud wall that necklaces the compound is too short to provide good cover. A small dirt knoll in the middle of the compound serves as a lookout of sorts. Inside the adobe house are two tiny rooms: a kitchen with a small cookstove and a bedroom with three string-laced cots. Tight quarters for a platoon of 30 men to wait out a barrage in.</p>\n<p>The commandos crouch in a line along the southern wall, popping up to take shots and slipping down to slam fresh magazines into their M-4 rifles. Waves of incoming fire—from machine guns, rifles and the occasional rocket-propelled grenade—continue in booms, cracks, whistles and pops. The shooting dies down for a moment, only to roar back as soon as an Afghan commando stands up to fire.</p>\n<p>Firefights usually don’t last long, maybe 10 to 15 minutes, though they can feel like years. This one is different. The shooting goes on and on. The insurgents must have a deep-pocketed source funding them to be able to throw this much ammo downrange. This is no pell-mell ragtag group attacking the commandos. This is ISIS.</p>\n<p> When the regular Afghan National Army can’t finish a fight, needs to clear an area or is pinned down, it calls in the commandos, the nation’s best and perhaps final line of defense. Calls for the elite special-operations unit have come in faster and faster since late 2014, when the Taliban started to retake territory vacated by withdrawing U.S. troops and coalition partners. Nearly 90 percent of foreign forces have now left Afghanistan. Under Mullah Akhtar Mansour—a leader with a brutal reputation who was killed by a U.S. drone strike in Pakistan in late May—the Taliban scored a string of battlefield victories, moving from rural skirmishes to direct assaults on big cities, fueled by thousands of fighters. It now controls more of Afghanistan than at any point since 2001, when the United States invaded. About half the country is currently under Taliban control, and more is on the verge of falling. And now ISIS—or Daesh, as it’s known locally—has also moved in.</p>\n<p>Despite some $35 billion in training and support from the U.S. and coalition partners, the Afghan army can’t seem to do much to stop them. Ravaged by desertions, internal squabbling, poor coordination between units and officers so corrupt they’ve been known to steal soldiers’ salaries and sell their equipment, the army races to respond to attacks instead of launching operations to root out the insurgents. Heavy fighting, combined with a lack of close air support and medical evacuations, has taken its toll: Around 5,000 soldiers were killed in 2015—nearly 30 percent more than in 2014.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_958/storage/images/media2/images/playboyintus1609_article_068_01_03/13030-1-eng-GB/playboyintus1609_article_068_01_032.jpg\" width=\"1349\" height=\"782\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"playboyintus1609_article_068_01_03\" title=\"playboyintus1609_article_068_01_03\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p>Afghan soldiers strap on their weapons during training and exercise drills at the commando “School of Excellence,” also known as Camp Commando, on the outskirts of Kabul. The 10,000-man force is spread thin and is often without proper equipment.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p> The Afghan army has yet to hammer out a clear strategy to defeat ISIS and the Taliban; instead it relies on the special-operations troops to put out fires. The commandos wrestled back control of the northern city of Kunduz after the Taliban seized it. They’re on the front lines in the south in Helmand province, buttressing a feeble army struggling to fight off waves of insurgents. And now they’ve been sent northeast to Nangarhar to smoke out ISIS.</p>\n<p>But the commandos are spread increasingly thin. Their missions are supposed to last 72 hours or less—hit a target and go home—but can actually stretch on for months. When they’re not babysitting an area for the army, the commandos are sometimes used to staff road checkpoints or bigwigs’ security details. “The misuse of commandos is endemic,” says a U.S. Green Beret master sergeant who trains the elite troops. “One platoon I know is being used as a politician’s personal protection force in Kabul.”</p>\n<p>After years of fighting and training alongside America’s legendary Green Berets, the commandos are now largely on their own. They became used to their sugar daddy calling the shots and giving them money, arms, air support and intelligence when things got tight. Not anymore. Now they must run the show and operate better than their U.S. advisors—or risk a Taliban takeover.</p>\n<p>But how long can an overworked force of 10,000 men hold together a country of 32 million people?</p>\n<p> On a bracingly cool December morning in the mountains south of Kabul, 1,000 soldiers stand in formation on the hard-packed parade ground at the training base known as Camp Commando. They are the latest graduates of the special-operations program, decked out in woodland-green camouflage uniforms and distinctive maroon berets, gripping M-4 rifles squarely across their chests, eyes locked straight ahead. An improvised red carpet of tribal rugs stretches from the front gate, past a viewing platform wrapped in Afghanistan’s national colors of red, black and green, to rows of steel risers crammed with Green Berets, Afghan officials and the foreign contractors who run the camp.</p>\n<p>The Afghan national anthem sputters out of loudspeakers; the gate glides open, and in march five top leaders of the Afghan army, their heads turned sharply to the left, holding a firm salute as they pass the soldiers.</p>\n<p>Colonel Jabar Wafa, the school’s commander, who with his taut, sun-drenched skin and looming build looks like an Afghan stand-in for John Wayne, approaches the microphone. “My hero soldiers,” he says, his eyes panning the crowd, “you are the ones with the responsibility to protect this country. Wherever and whenever the ANA has a tough fight, they call on you, the commandos. We will put the insurgents on the run.”</p>\n<p>“<i>Allahu Akbar!</i>” the troops roar. “God is great!”</p>\n<p>The ceremony marks the graduation of the country’s biggest class of commandos since the school’s founding in 2007. Five times a year, new recruits arrive at this former Russian parachutist base to be trained to join a unit widely considered the best in the country. They are selected during basic training for their aptitude, strength and ethnicity. Overseen by Green Berets, they undergo a rigorous three-month class of advanced infantry skills. The students are chosen to reflect the country: Nearly half are Pashtun, about 25 percent are Tajik, and the rest Uzbek, Hazara or Turkmen.</p>\n<p>Until this fall, classes were capped at 650 students. But the uptick in casualties and fighting has pushed the Afghan Ministry of Defense to rapidly expand the commando ranks. The pass rate, once 80 percent, has been bumped to 100 percent. There’s talk of a sixth class this year.</p>\n<p>The commandos are supposed to be the best-supplied of any unit in the Afghan army, but the strain on the camp’s resources is evident. Barracks are crowded, with at least four men per room, and lines for the 16 toilets are long. Recruits are allotted only 800 bullets instead of the 5,000 rounds they’re supposed to receive. None of their footwear or uniforms match because there aren’t enough to go around. Some wear tan or black boots; many wear sneakers secured with laces or Velcro.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_958/storage/images/media2/images/playboyintus1609_article_068_01_04/13023-1-eng-GB/playboyintus1609_article_068_01_042.jpg\" width=\"356\" height=\"218\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"playboyintus1609_article_068_01_04\" title=\"playboyintus1609_article_068_01_04\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p>1.

Commandos take cover in a mud-walled compound near the Pakistan border while ISIS pins them down for nearly 16 hours.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p> Still, the quality of the recruits has improved since the school’s early years, says Donnie Barber, an American contractor who has been training soldiers at the camp for the past nine years. In the early years, he says, most troops couldn’t read or write, and he had to teach them to count. Half the current recruits are now illiterate. The new command staff is making an effort to take better care of soldiers and has improved meals, installed a volleyball court and opened a recreation center.</p>\n<p> “These Afghans get it,” says Barber, wearing a baseball cap and sporting a tattoo on his left arm from his old unit, the 82nd Airborne. “When we leave, they’re going to be able to carry on.”</p>\n<p>In a country where most people identify with their tribes and not as Afghans, the outlook of some of the recruits is surprising. “I joined the army to serve my country,” Staff Sergeant Said Jallaludin, 22, a Turkmen from the northern city of Mazar-e-Sharif, tells me while cleaning his M-4 rifle. “I want peace not only in Mazar but in all of the country. If I go to Helmand, Kunduz, wherever, each place is my country.”</p>\n<p>There’s more than a patriotic incentive to enlist; there’s also a financial one. In the wake of the U.S. and coalition troop pullout, Afghanistan’s unemployment rate skyrocketed to 25 percent. Jallaludin was a laborer and part-time student with few prospects; he thought the army would give him a career, or at least decent pay. A newly minted commando makes $250 a month—more if he serves in especially dangerous areas—while a regular soldier receives $200.</p>\n<p>At the graduation ceremony, Jallaludin goose-steps forward to accept his graduation certificate, salutes the chief of the army and holds out his right hand. He then spins around and barks to the waiting platoons of commandos, “Afghanistan, I am ready to protect you.”</p>\n<p> Nangarhar is the latest region of Afghanistan to need the commandos’ protection. The province, home to the Tora Bora cave complex where Osama bin Laden hid early in the Iraq war, has long been a roiling stew of Taliban, Al Qaeda, foreign fighters, drug traffickers—and now ISIS. The Pakistani army launched a campaign in 2014 to drive extremists out of its country’s lawless northern states. Those who weren’t killed fled to Nangarhar, recruited disgruntled Taliban and re-branded themselves as Islamic State-Khorasan, the local affiliate of ISIS. Numbering as many as 3,000, they began a campaign of beheadings and bombings, sending thousands of locals fleeing to the provincial capital of Jalalabad.</p>\n<p>The situation has so alarmed Washington that in January, U.S. forces ramped up air strikes in the country threefold. The Obama administration is considering slowing the scheduled drawdown of the remaining 9,800 U.S. troops. Lieutenant General John Nicholson, who took over as commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan early this year, declared that eliminating the Islamic State and Al Qaeda branches in Afghanistan is his “first and foremost” priority.</p>\n<p>Early last year, ISIS announced it would use Nangarhar as a launching pad for attacks and would advance into neighboring provinces. This angered the Taliban, and the two have been battling for supremacy since. For months the army, distracted by other problems, left them alone to kill each other off—until Islamic State fighters started attacking and killing Afghan police officers. The furious provincial police chief demanded that the army intervene.</p>\n<p> Days later, the commandos get the call. They’re ordered to leave their base near Jalalabad and speed to Achin, a district in Nangarhar on the border with Pakistan that has long been home to a thriving Taliban-run drug trade and is now the site of near-daily clashes between ISIS and other extremists. Things had gotten so bad there that the deputy speaker of parliament who represents Nangarhar formed his own 200-man militia and led it into battle against ISIS.</p>\n<p>The commandos roll out around six P.M. in a convoy of 18 Humvees. A stop in central Achin to coordinate with the army, police and border patrol drags on till midnight. The Afghan National Army has tentative control over a V-shape tract of ground south of town that was under fire from the Islamic State. The army needs the commandos to take enough ground to fill in the V and push south; the army will follow behind and hold that ground. At least that’s the idea.</p>\n<p>Leading the commandos this night is a young captain who recently transferred from another battalion, or <i>kandak.</i> It’s his first job in the region. His inexperience worries the commandos, but the rising number of missions has left no seasoned officers available. The rookie captain won’t even have a Green Beret advisor accompanying him as a backstop if he gets into trouble. After the U.S. shifted to a training and advisory role in late 2014, the Afghans were put in charge of the fight. U.S. Special Forces now rarely go on missions, unless things go sideways.</p>\n<p>The captain sets up his command post and heavy weapons on a small hill two miles north of where the commandos will be operating—usually a commander sets his post 500 yards behind his assault team so he can see what’s going on and support them. The commandos complain among themselves about his incompetence and seeming lack of courage, a damning slight in a country where a man is judged by his bravery.</p>\n<p>There isn’t much to be done except head out. The 60 men of the two platoons slip on their hydration packs, adjust their radios and stride into the night. The darkness is so thick and complete it’s difficult to see. Figures that loom threateningly in the murk turn into benign trees on closer inspection. Hours later, the moon is bright enough to illuminate the walking men.</p>\n<p>With daybreak only a few hours away, the commandos maintain a brisk pace. The soldiers trek up and slide down stony mountains, sometimes jumping from outcropping to outcropping when the descent is too steep to walk. There are no trails, not even a goat track. Slip-sliding, the soldiers move down into a valley, finding two abandoned compounds the army has cleared. Exhausted, the commandos trudge inside, First Platoon to the far right compound, Third Platoon to the left.</p>\n<p>They pull off their M-4s, lean them against the walls and sit down heavily. Some slip off their helmets and rest them in their laps. “What’s next?” asks Ahmad (not his real name), an interpreter who works with the commandos and Green Berets. No one seems to know.</p>\n<p>A radio sputters. Ahmad perks up, then sits back and groans after hearing the orders. “Oh shit. Be ready to move. We’re heading back the way we came in five minutes,” he says. The other commandos look at one another.</p>\n<p>There isn’t much to do. An order is an order. The soldiers collect their weapons and helmets and get ready to leave.</p>\n<p>But the radio buzzes again. Ahmad listens intently. “Okay, we’re not doing that anymore,” he says to everyone. “We’re to wait for instructions.”</p>\n<p>The next hour and a half passes this way, commands ebbing and flowing like tides. The radio buzzes with an order to move, and a few minutes later another order reverses it. Frustration mounting, the men mutter to one another that something needs to be done.</p>\n<p>A few soldiers sip water. No one eats. They have little to no food. The army didn’t issue any, and the soldiers don’t want to pay for it. With large families to support on a salary of a few hundred dollars a month, it’s better to save as much as they can.</p>\n<p>By now it’s 3:30 in the morning and dinner is a faint memory. My photographer’s pack is stuffed with 10 pounds of granola bars, energy drinks and other snacks. She pours them on the dirt floor and gestures to the commandos to eat. They crowd around and snatch up the food. A few men close their eyes for a nap. The radio has gone quiet. Dawn is coming. Why aren’t the commandos, who have night-vision goggles and can operate at night when the insurgents can’t, moving?</p>\n<p>“I bet you anything the captain will tell us to move at daylight,” Ahmad says. “And if that happens, we’re going to be shot at.”</p>\n<p>The sun slowly rises, streaking the sky with oranges, purples and pinks. Sure enough, the radio buzzes. Time to move. The instructions are vague, the captain directing the commandos to take over nearby compounds.</p>\n<p>Ahmad curses. “This is a bad idea,” he mutters. “Hey, German, don’t you want to say something?” he asks the squad leader, nicknamed because of his light brown hair and pale skin. German shrugs. “We’re soldiers,” he says. “We follow orders.”</p>\n<p>The soldiers snake out across the valley floor, the black ISIS flag fluttering in the distance. That’s when the attack starts.</p>\n<p> Bullets chew at the dirt walls of the compound where First Platoon has taken shelter. Third Platoon has found another several hundred yards away. An RPG occasionally sails overhead, its distinctive whine piercing the air. The commandos take turns along the southern perimeter wall, jack-in-the-boxing up to fire their M-4 rifles whenever they feel a lull in the incoming fire. A machine gunner sets up in a protected spot along the wall, his weapon’s staccato <i>thud-thud-thud</i> puncturing the air.</p>\n<p>As the hours slide by, the shooting from the unseen enemy grows thicker, advancing now from the east and west. ISIS fighters are closing in. The commandos’ radio has gone quiet again; they cannot raise their captain. The men lean against the walls, cradling their rifles, looking at one another with wide eyes. “I can’t believe this,” says one. “What is this captain thinking?”</p>\n<p><i>“Mushkele! Mushkele!</i> Problem! Problem!” someone shouts outside. The commandos race to the perimeter wall and see one of their own on his back, his buddies working to remove his body armor. A bullet came in through a softball-size hole in the wall, hitting his right side, close to the underarm. The wound is deep.</p>\n<p class=\"pullQuote\"><b>THE SHOOTING DIES DOWN, ONLY TO ROAR BACK AS A COMMANDO STANDS UP TO FIRE.</b></p>\n<p>They bandage the downed commando and haul a cot outside to use as a stretcher. Back to the radio to try to rouse help. “We need a medevac immediately,” the operator barks into the radio. The answer that crackles back churns their stomachs: “It’s a three-hour wait,” the voice says. “There are no helicopters available.” It’s a common, and lethal, issue for Afghan soldiers: Their tiny, overstretched air force is chronically short of pilots and helicopters for evacuating troops.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_958/storage/images/media2/images/playboyintus1609_article_068_01_07/13002-1-eng-GB/playboyintus1609_article_068_01_072.jpg\" width=\"621\" height=\"483\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"playboyintus1609_article_068_01_07\" title=\"playboyintus1609_article_068_01_07\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p>An Afghan fighter fires his weapon at ISIS insurgents while on a mission in Achin district, Nangarhar province, Afghanistan.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div>\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_958/storage/images/media2/images/playboyintus1609_article_068_01_08/12995-1-eng-GB/playboyintus1609_article_068_01_082.jpg\" width=\"488\" height=\"483\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"playboyintus1609_article_068_01_08\" title=\"playboyintus1609_article_068_01_08\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p>Afghan Platoon Sergeant German, nicknamed thus because of his light hair and skin, receives news that one of his soldiers has died after being shot in the side by an ISIS sniper.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p> The commandos manage to stop their comrade’s bleeding, but it’s a temporary fix. They know he won’t last three hours. They will have to carry him out themselves.</p>\n<p>Four commandos lift the wounded man onto one of the string cots and wait for a lull in the shooting. When it comes, they each grab a bed leg and rush across the adjoining field, heading for the relative shelter of a stand of trees.</p>\n<p>They make it 100 yards before one of the carriers is hit in the leg. The men drop to the ground while another commando in the compound lays down cover fire with a machine gun. The one who was hit fast-limps back to the house while the other three grab the badly wounded man and run for the trees. A volunteer sprints out to help them. I learn later that they carried their comrade two miles back to the overwatch site where the captain sat, but the man died in an ambulance en route to the hospital in Jalalabad.</p>\n<p>Back in the compound, the shooting gets closer and louder and closer and louder. A commando bursts in, shouting that ISIS fighters dressed in camouflage have sneaked into the neighboring compound, about 100 yards away, between this compound and Third Platoon’s. The commandos can’t shoot at them for fear of hitting Third Platoon.</p>\n<p> The captain has artillery, mortars and a.50-caliber anti-aircraft heavy machine gun—all useless because they’re too far away to help. Ahmad passes word by radio to one of the Green Berets he works with that the commandos are pinned down and need help. Eventually an Afghan attack helicopter arrives, circles for 10 minutes while randomly shooting and then departs.</p>\n<p>Morale plummets; the commandos feel abandoned. No cavalry is coming to their rescue because <i>they</i> are the cavalry. Fear coils tightly in their stomachs. No one wants to say what is apparent: ISIS is pounding their compound hard before an impending invasion. Men feel for the reassuring grip of their knives and think of hand-to-hand combat.</p>\n<p><i>Thak-thak-thak.</i>Machine gun and AK-47 fire seems to be pouring in from all directions. Two RPGs overshoot the compound and sail high overhead. The ISIS snipers looking down from a hill, however, are on target; their rounds slice into the room through windows and a hole in the wall. There is no sign of the Afghan National Army soldiers who are supposed to come to the commandos’ aid. Their only chance now is to stick it out until the sun goes down and their night-vision gear gives them the advantage.</p>\n<p>As day slips into night, the commandos in both platoons get the call they’ve been waiting for: Assault the nearby ISIS compound. They creep outside, fan out in all directions and storm the house, killing the handful of insurgents inside with wild bursts of gunfire.</p>\n<p>The commandos were eager to move on to assault the main ISIS forces on the hill, take out the snipers who’d been wreaking so much havoc and burn their flag, but their commander ordered them to retreat to the compound. Not wanting to incur casualties, he decided to do nothing and wait to be ordered back to base, Ahmad tells me later.</p>\n<p>New commandos arrived on foot a day or two later with supplies of food and water. There were still no helicopters available. The commandos spent 10 days holed up in the compound with the insurgents taking occasional potshots at them, until a general intervened and ordered them to retreat.</p>\n<p>The black flag still fluttered high over the valley.</p>\n","layout":{},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":0,"link_source":"","competition":[],"flatplan_title":"","notes":"","gutter_credit":"","other":"","image":[{"id":"zinio_playboyintus1609_article_068_01_image_0_1471453195.231","name":"playboyintus1609_article_068_01_01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_958/storage/images/media2/images/playboyintus1609_article_068_01_01/13044-1-eng-GB/playboyintus1609_article_068_01_012.jpg?t=default_ipad_portrait&ext/playboyintus1609_article_068_01_012_default_ipad_portrait.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"768","height":"464","legacy_id":"1425","is_default":true},{"id":"zinio_playboyintus1609_article_068_01_image_0_1471453195.231","name":"playboyintus1609_article_068_01_01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_958/storage/images/media2/images/playboyintus1609_article_068_01_01/13044-1-eng-GB/playboyintus1609_article_068_01_012.jpg?t=default_ipad_landscape&ext/playboyintus1609_article_068_01_012_default_ipad_landscape.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"1024","height":"619","legacy_id":"1425","is_default":false}],"related_objects":{"image":[{"id":"zinio_playboyintus1609_article_068_01_image_7_1471453190.627","name":"playboyintus1609_article_068_01_08","source":"","caption":"<p>Afghan Platoon Sergeant German, nicknamed thus because of his light hair and skin, receives news that one of his soldiers has died after being shot in the side by an ISIS sniper.</p>\n","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_958/storage/images/media2/images/playboyintus1609_article_068_01_08/12995-1-eng-GB/playboyintus1609_article_068_01_082.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"488","height":"483","legacy_id":"1418"},{"id":"zinio_playboyintus1609_article_068_01_image_7_1471453190.627","name":"playboyintus1609_article_068_01_08","source":"","caption":"<p>Afghan Platoon Sergeant German, nicknamed thus because of his light hair and skin, receives news that one of his soldiers has died after being shot in the side by an ISIS sniper.</p>\n","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_958/storage/images/media2/images/playboyintus1609_article_068_01_08/12995-1-eng-GB/playboyintus1609_article_068_01_082.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"488","height":"483","legacy_id":"1418"},{"id":"zinio_playboyintus1609_article_068_01_image_6_1471453191.3778","name":"playboyintus1609_article_068_01_07","source":"","caption":"<p>An Afghan fighter fires his weapon at ISIS insurgents while on a mission in Achin district, Nangarhar province, Afghanistan.</p>\n","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_958/storage/images/media2/images/playboyintus1609_article_068_01_07/13002-1-eng-GB/playboyintus1609_article_068_01_072.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"621","height":"483","legacy_id":"1419"},{"id":"zinio_playboyintus1609_article_068_01_image_6_1471453191.3778","name":"playboyintus1609_article_068_01_07","source":"","caption":"<p>An Afghan fighter fires his weapon at ISIS insurgents while on a mission in Achin district, Nangarhar province, Afghanistan.</p>\n","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_958/storage/images/media2/images/playboyintus1609_article_068_01_07/13002-1-eng-GB/playboyintus1609_article_068_01_072.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"621","height":"483","legacy_id":"1419"},{"id":"zinio_playboyintus1609_article_068_01_image_5_1471453191.9753","name":"playboyintus1609_article_068_01_06","source":"","caption":"<p>2.

The work boot works with everything.</b></h3><p>A great pair of boots is an investment that will give your look character. And as they get worn in, they’ll become a part of your personal signature. You can wear a classic work boot everywhere and with everything from jeans at a concert to a suit on a date at a nice restaurant. Texas-based Helm Boots slims the profile of its made-in-the-USA stompers with the new Ayers model (pictured at right). The slightly dressier silhouette still feels casual with a rubber sole and Helm’s trademark white stripe.</p>\n<h3><b>2. A suit is more than a suit.</b></h3><p>You probably don’t wear a suit to work every day, but it’s still an important wardrobe player if you pitch it right. The key is to pick a versatile style you can break apart and wear as separates. Look for a slim version with natural, unpadded shoulders and less-formal patch pockets, like Suitsupply’s Havana model ($499, <a href=\"http://us.suitsupply.com\" target=\"_self\">us.suitsupply.com</a>). The jacket can serve as a blazer with a pair of jeans, and the slim trousers will work with a casual sweater or even a high-low combination such as a hoodie and boots (see Rule 5). A solid shade is always a good choice, or dial it up with a subtle windowpane plaid in gray and camel Italian wool.</p>\n<h3><b>3. Make your new pair of jeans 1990s-style washed black denim.</b></h3><p>No sweat if you missed Kurt Cobain, grunge and faded black denim the first time around. Somehow an amalgam of rocker bona fides and soulful nuance, washed and artfully distressed black jeans are the newest denim treatment for those bent on escaping the ever-present blues. Take Nudie Jeans’s interpretation from its Replica series based on actual worn pairs, in the skinny Grim Tim fit ($250, <a href=\"http://nudiejeans.com\" target=\"_self\">nudiejeans.com</a>). To avoid flyover-country overtones, keep the look simple and sharp with just an inky black T-shirt or an urban parka and grounded with black lace-up boots or canvas kicks.</p>\n<h3><b>4. Clear is the new black when it comes to eyewear.</b></h3><p>Going clear is a reverse-chic move that’s trending in both sunglasses and eyeglasses. Transparent frames signal that you’re above the style-wars fray, but their attitude makes an indelible impression nonetheless. Cutler and Gross offers splurge-a-rific see-through sunnies in either round or D-frame models with groovy green lenses, while Moscot’s squared-off 1960s Nebb style oozes <i>The Graduate</i> cool.</p>\n<h3><b> 5. It’s time to elevate your hoodie game.</b></h3><p>No excuses. This fall, all the big designers have a heightened take on the humble hoodie: Rag &amp; Bone’s black funnel-neck version under a slim overcoat, Michael Kors’s skiwear-inspired hoodie–bomber jacket hybrid or L.A. streetwear ace John Elliott’s oversize textured hoodie layered over his signature elongated tees. A spiffed-up hoodie, often in a fabric with a high-tech sheen, raises your style game without sacrificing the comfort of an old standby.</p>\n<h3><b> 6. AND YES, THE SHOES WILL MAKE IT OR BREAK IT.</b></h3><p>Women notice footwear. For that reason, among several others, the shoes are where any wardrobe overhaul should begin. The good news? Just as that pair of square-toed slip-ons you’ve had since high school will ruin your nine-to-five look, the right pair of suede loafers or pristine high-tops can raise an otherwise toned-down ensemble to new heights.</p>\n<h3><b> 7. SPEND MONEY ON BIG ITEMS.</b></h3><p>Certain things in your closet have a longer shelf life than others. Jeans, shirts and sweaters will wear out, look dated or get ruined by hot sauce within a few years. Outerwear, suits and leather-soled shoes can last decades. Three things to remember: First, buy in neutral tones such as navy, gray or black—colors that never go out of style. Second, learn how to spot-clean a jacket and use a shoe brush. Third, treat these items like the investments they are; if it doesn’t hurt a bit when you buy them, you’re not spending enough.</p>\n<h3><b> 8. BUY QUALITY, NOT BRANDS.</b></h3><p>It feels good to own a coveted label, but designer brands don’t always carry the same quality throughout their product range. If you’re going to splurge on a big name, make it count: Things like Burberry trenches, Gucci loafers and Brunello Cucinelli cashmere sweaters are iconic and worth the money. Yeezy white T-shirts, not so much.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_958/storage/images/media2/images/playboyintus1609_article_076_01_03/13109-1-eng-GB/playboyintus1609_article_076_01_032.jpg\" width=\"549\" height=\"788\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"playboyintus1609_article_076_01_03\" title=\"playboyintus1609_article_076_01_03\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p>Haerfest J1 backpack, $375, <a href=\"http://site-958.audiencemedia.com\" target=\"_self\">haerfest.com</a>.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p class=\"pullQuote\"><b>THE TREND TOWARD ACTIVEWEAR IS NOT CARTE BLANCHE TO ROCK YOUR PAJAMAS TO DINNER.</b></p>\n<h3><b>9. You can carry a backpack, but you need to up your game.</b></h3><p>There’s no reason to give up the hands-free convenience of a backpack out in the real world, but it’s time for a smarter-looking version. Emerging brand Haerfest (pronounced “harvest”) has just the ticket. Its J1 backpack (pictured below) is a luxury-meets-tech combo of leather and sturdy, line-patterned premium nylon. Neither too large nor too small, the carryall features a fully lined main compartment and a front pouch, both cleanly designed with concealed zippers, as well as smaller interior zip pockets and an inner sleeve—all in a noticeable but still neutral olive.</p>\n<h3><b> 10. Would-be collectors, embrace the starter watch.</b></h3><p>The classic Rolex Datejust tops the list for newcomers, according to Jon Goldfarb, owner of Second Time Around Watch Company, a Beverly Hills institution for 40 years. “It’s recognizable and holds its value. It’s something most people will recognize when a guy is wearing one on his wrist,” he says. The iconic watch dates back to 1945 and is still made today. Expect to shell out anywhere from the mid-$2,000s to the low $3,000s for a standard model; variables affecting the price include whether it’s all stainless or stainless with white or yellow gold, whether it has a classic silver dial or a more uncommon colored face, and whether it comes with its original presentation box and papers.</p>\n<h3><b> 11. This is the only skin product you need to face the world.</b></h3><p>Hollywood men’s grooming expert Cheryl Marks, who tends to Will Arnett among other celebrities, says her guys go nuts over Jack Black Double Duty SPF 20 face moisturizer ($28, <a href=\"http://getjackblack.com\" target=\"_self\">getjackblack.com</a>). “It has everything they need, and they don’t feel like they have anything on,” she says. “It does its job and feels good on the skin.” Lightweight and non-oily, the potion hydrates skin for a better appearance and offers broad-spectrum protection against UVA and UVB rays. Fragrance-free and packed with vitamins and antioxidants, it’s formulated for all skin types.</p>\n<h3><b> 12. Athleisure: Just because you can doesn’t mean you should.</b></h3><p>It’s now possible to be both comfortable and stylish (see: tapered sweats, ultralight runners, looser cuts), but there are limits. The trend toward activewear does not give you carte blanche to rock your pajamas to dinner or dress head-to-toe in matching logos like an off-duty gym teacher. The winning play here is moderation, combining one or two informal elements with an otherwise put-together look. Try a pair of monochromatic Nike Roshe Ones ($75, <a href=\"http://store.nike.com\" target=\"_self\">store.nike.com</a>) with dark jeans for a style that’s equal parts sporty and polished.</p>\n<h3><b> 13. BUY TRENDS IN ACCESSORIES.</b></h3><p>Botanical prints are big right now. Buy them in shirts, socks, ties, maybe a five-panel hat—but not a suit. Trends are fun to wear, but they work best when combined with the classic standbys already in your wardrobe. Need proof? Google “Justin Timberlake denim suit.” You never want to be that guy.</p>\n<h3><b> 14. SELVEDGE IS GOOD; STRETCH SELVEDGE IS BETTER.</b></h3><p>Selvedge jeans in dark indigo are an integral part of any man’s wardrobe, but spending six months breaking in a pair is no fun. Recent advances in textile technology, however, have made it possible to have great-looking selvedge jeans that are also exceptionally comfortable from the first wear. Try on a pair of Naked &amp; Famous Denim’s Weird Guy stretch selvedge ($166, <a href=\"http://tateandyoko.com\" target=\"_self\">tateandyoko.com</a>) and you’ll never go back.</p>\n<h3><b> 15. DON’T SETTLE FOR A SHIRT THAT DOESN’T FIT PROPERLY.</b></h3><p>All shirts are not created equal, nor are they sized the same—so don’t settle for a button-down that doesn’t fit just right. Shorter, skinnier guys can turn to Uniqlo (sized for petite Japanese dudes) and Thom Browne, while classic American brands including J. Crew and Ralph Lauren tend to fall on the larger side. Once you find a shirt that suits you (shoulder seams should sit at the edge of your shoulders; the front should be snug without puckering), buy it in quantity.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_958/storage/images/media2/images/playboyintus1609_article_076_01_04/13102-1-eng-GB/playboyintus1609_article_076_01_042.jpg\" width=\"937\" height=\"997\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"playboyintus1609_article_076_01_04\" title=\"playboyintus1609_article_076_01_04\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p>John Varvatos wool peacoat, $1,298, <a href=\"http://site-958.audiencemedia.com\" target=\"_self\">johnvarvatos.com</a>.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>16. You’ll need a tailor (a really good one).</b></h3><p>Some guys can dress entirely off the rack and look great, but for the rest of us it takes a bit of modification. This is doubly true when it comes to suiting, which succeeds or fails depending on how well it fits your body. A good tailor can mean the difference between your looking like a kid in his dad’s suit and looking like the guy who owns the place. Do some research. Ask around. Approach the best-dressed man in your office and find out where he gets his clothes tailored. And then be explicit about what you want. Traditional tailors can be a conservative lot, so if you want that suit skinny, make sure they make it skinny. If you like a high-water look, don’t let them talk you out of it. The first time you wear a jacket or trousers that fit you perfectly, you’ll understand.</p>\n<h3><b> 17. A little military goes a long way.</b></h3><p>Fashion has gone hard corps for fall, with military looks crowding the runways along with an attendant surfeit of shiny brass buttons, kitschy braid trim and tricked-out fatigue jackets. Serviceman style has been a perennial influence for designers, but you want to look current, not like you’re dressed for a costume party. Go for a contemporary interpretation such as the wool peacoat from John Varvatos (pictured above), with its regimental border stripe in a subtly contrasting gray and the unexpected but sleek addition of black leather panels at the pockets. As Mr. Varvatos himself says, “Military-inspired clothes are masculine and classic. They never go out of style, which is why men love wearing them each season.”</p>\n<h3><b> 18. FIND A STYLE ICON AND LET HIM GUIDE YOU.</b></h3><p>Maybe it’s your dad, maybe it’s Steve McQueen, maybe it’s Cornel West. These guys spent decades perfecting the art of dressing, and you could definitely learn a thing or two from them. Take note not just of what they wear, but of how they wear it, the countless details that make a studied outfit look effortless. Finally, make the look your own, adding and subtracting elements to tailor it to your lifestyle and personality.</p>\n<h3><b> 19. BUY LOCAL (AND PAY A BIT MORE FOR IT).</b></h3><p>Guys have more style options than ever before, from international mega-retailers as well as homegrown brands. Both have their strengths, but buying clothes that are made in the United States not only supports our economy, but the garments are often of much higher quality than fast-fashion imports. Check out Alden for shoes, Freeman for outerwear and Tanner Goods for belts and wallets. Spend a bit extra and feel good about wearing something made in your hometown.</p>\n<h3><b> 20. ACCESSORIZE WISELY.</b></h3><p> Personalize your style by working in a handcrafted accessory. It might be a rough-hammered silver bracelet, a worn and aged vintage belt or a handmade leather portfolio. Keep it simple and take some time to search out the talisman that says something about you.</p>\n<p class=\"pullQuote\"><b>WOMEN NOTICE FOOTWEAR.

For Chauncey Hawkins, then known as the rapper Loon, it was the first time he felt like a hip-hop star.</p>\n<p>Loon arrived on the Miami set that February 2002 afternoon with a plan. First, he selected his motorcycle for the video, settling on a Harley-Davidson chopper with ape-hanger handlebars that not only looked cool but provided a stable ride. He also decided to play to the camera. In his previous video with Puffy, “I Need a Girl (Part One),” Loon at times faded into the background. This time around he was more confident, brazenly elbowing his way into shots—dancing, champagne flute in hand, surrounded by women; leaning on a Ferrari 360 Spider as if he owned it; weaving through the streets of Miami on his bike alongside Puff and the R&amp;B singer Ginuwine, appearing to be every bit as much a celebrity as his more famous collaborators.</p>\n<p>But something else had changed since “Part One”: The fans on the set—the women in particular—weren’t there merely for Puff. “It was amazing to hear people actually screaming for me,” Loon recalls. “It was everything I had worked for, everything I had strived for.”</p>\n<p>Then it all changed. Just as Hawkins had become Loon, Loon became Amir Junaid Muhadith, and then, in July 2013, he became a federal inmate in North Carolina. Far from the private helicopters and champagne flutes, Muhadith is loath to discuss the journey—his debauched life as Sean Combs’s wingman; the horrors of crack-era Harlem that he barely escaped; the sex, drugs and violence.</p>\n<p>“How can I explain this without glorifying it?” he says.</p>\n<p> Situated about 20 minutes north of Durham, North Carolina, the Butner Federal Correctional Complex emerges like a squat concrete box from the verdant undergrowth. It’s a sunny spring morning, and the visiting room is awash with friends and family of inmates. A little girl plays Connect Four against a man with tattooed knuckles. A woman wearing a Tom Brady jersey hugs an inmate. The world’s two friendliest prison guards man the front desk.</p>\n<p>A bit past nine A.M., Muhadith, the man who revived Puff Daddy’s music career after writing the “I Need a Girl” series, enters the room. His standard-issue uniform consists of drab olive-green khakis, a matching button-down shirt and black Nike sneakers. For a man of 41, Muhadith sports a privileged, tight hairline. And though he’s gained 17 pounds since being incarcerated, he’s still in excellent shape thanks to daily calisthenics, cardio and the requisite lifting routine, though only to stay toned. “I can’t get prison swole,” he jokes. But what’s most striking is his majestic beard, an unruly gray-speckled mass that extends halfway down his chest.</p>\n<p>Since this is a minimum-security building, little trouble brews here. Sure, tempers occasionally flare, as is natural when some 300 men share any institutional facility, but nobody would risk being sent up the road to a higher-security building. Muhadith scans the room. “I know all these guys,” he says. “You can tell who’s in here for drugs and who’s in here for white-collar crimes.” Jesse Jackson Jr. served time here. Bernie Madoff is in a medium-security building. “A spy, Spanish guy, Dominguez, was here,” Muhadith says. “He told me stories about [former Panamanian dictator Manuel] Noriega.”</p>\n<p class=\"pullQuote\"><b>LOON WAS A PERFECT FIT FOR BAD BOY. COOL, COCKY AND HANDSOME, HE PERSONIFIED TURN-OF-THE-MILLENNIUM HARLEM SWAG.</b></p>\n<p>Muhadith’s trip here began in December 2008 when he quit the music industry, converted to Islam and renamed himself Amir Junaid Muhadith. In 2010 he moved to Egypt, where he subsisted as a television host and nascent voice on the religious-lecture circuit. Then, in November 2011, he was arrested in Brussels Airport on felony drug charges. The indictment stated that Muhadith “knowingly and intentionally conspired…with others, known and unknown, to possess with intent to distribute” heroin in North Carolina between 2006 and 2008. He pleaded guilty upon his extradition to the United States. According to Muhadith, he had two felonies already under his belt and risked getting 25 years to life if he went to trial. He couldn’t take that chance. He was sentenced to 14 years in prison.</p>\n<p>Muhadith calls it “guilt by association. Everything was hearsay. There was no tangible evidence.” To hear him tell it: One night at Hot Beats Recording Studio in Atlanta, a rapper he was advising asked Muhadith to introduce him to a heroin supplier. Muhadith complied, which he says was the end of his involvement but enough to place him under the umbrella of conspiracy once federal charges were brought against the other artist.</p>\n<p>Muhadith says there are discrepancies in the case, including one that should have gotten it thrown out: The indictment states that he was involved in this conspiracy from 2006 to 2008. But, he says, he didn’t meet the individual until 2008. Why did he even make the introduction? “That, um, was just me being stupid, really,” he says wistfully. “It was just a brief introduction. It cost me 168 months.”</p>\n<p>Muhadith, who sprinkles his speech with Arabic and verses from the Koran, remains upbeat despite his long sentence. “The thing that makes this easy for me is my religion,” he says. “As long as I accord to what Islam teaches, it doesn’t matter where I’m at.”</p>\n<p> He is, in other words, firmly in the present—though at times he’s like an old guy at a bar, reminiscing about his heyday. “I’m actually grateful that those things happened,” he says, “because all those events led me to where I am now.”</p>\n<p> The Harlem of Amir Muhadith’s formative years didn’t resemble the glories of the Harlem Renaissance or the gentrified neighborhood it is today; some of the brownstones featured on <i>Million Dollar Listing New York</i> were crack houses when Loon walked these streets. In his Harlem, kids grew up fast; Muhadith spent his boyhood fighting, selling crack, smoking weed, snorting coke, shooting dice and having sex with older women. “I grew up exposed to a lot of criminal behavior,” he says.</p>\n<p>His parents, William “Hamburger” Hughley and Carol Hawkins, were dubbed the Bonnie and Clyde of 116th Street, hustlers who profited from Harlem’s heroin epidemic in the 1970s. Burger was sporty, stylish. He also may not be Muhadith’s biological father. Carol worked for the drug lord Nicky Barnes, dubbed “Mr. Untouchable” by <i>The New York Times Magazine.</i> When she became pregnant, Carol says, Barnes threw her a million-dollar baby shower.</p>\n<p>Born in 1975, Muhadith had everything growing up but supervision. “I was a great provider, because I hustled,” Carol says. “It didn’t change until he was about five, which was when a lot of the crackdown started. Then that crack demon came along.” Barnes was sent away in 1978, a few years before crack replaced heroin as the neighborhood scourge. By the time that transition was complete, in the mid-1980s, Carol, once a budding queen-pin, was a junkie.</p>\n<p>While Carol battled addiction, her mother, Evelyn Hawkins, a pious beautician, and her father, John, a World War II vet, raised Muhadith in Esplanade Gardens. The 1,872-unit complex situated on the Harlem River was originally sold as a middle-class oasis with an Olympic-size swimming pool and the subway at its doorstep. But when Muhadith was 14, one of his friends was shot outside building number four.</p>\n<p>Fearing for her grandson’s safety, Evelyn sent him to live with his godfather, the movie producer George Jackson (<i>Krush Groove, New Jack City</i>), in Beverly Hills. Suddenly Muhadith was the original Fresh Prince. He was still angry, though, and still hobnobbed with the wrong crowd. He was classmates with Angelina Jolie and other rich kids at Beverly Hills High but gravitated toward the Mansfield Crips on the West Side. He was nicknamed Loon, as in “loony Loon,” for doing crazy shit, mostly fighting, and he lived up to the moniker. “I beat the wheels off this white boy on my track team for putting his feet on me at practice,” Muhadith recalls. Embarrassed, Jackson threw him out after a little more than a year.</p>\n<p>Back with his grandparents in Harlem, Muhadith slung crack. “I started hustling to be in the streets with my mother. In some sick, sadistic way that was my way of being with her,” he says. “Me and my mom are like brother and sister—that’s common where I come from. But she put me through so much.”</p>\n<p>Carol Hawkins gambled, stole crack from dealers and even helped herself to her son’s stash, which was hidden in a hollowed-out stuffed animal. “My mom stole so much money from me that it put me in debt to some malicious guys,” Muhadith says. Once he’d paid back his suppliers, he made a deal with his mother: “I told her, ‘If you stop using drugs, I’ll stop selling drugs, because you are about to get me killed.’ From that day on, my mother was drug-free, and I left the streets. I never sold drugs again.”</p>\n<p> Although hip-hop was born nearby, in the Bronx, Harlem wasn’t fertile ground for rappers. Rap was considered a reach, while crack, on the other hand, was making a lot of people a lot of money. That route closed for Muhadith with his mother’s sobriety.</p>\n<p>He started by writing rhymes in a diary. Eventually, after filling “notebook after notebook,” he found the courage to spit for hip-hop pioneer Fab 5 Freddy, a friend of George Jackson’s and the host of <i>Yo! MTV Raps.</i> Freddy wasn’t impressed. “That’s a freestyle,” he said dismissively after each rhyme. However, he did offer some constructive criticism: Write complete concepts and complete stories. With that advice in hand, the newly named Loon set out to pursue a career in rap.</p>\n<p>In 1997, Harlem finally produced a bona fide rap star, Mase—a former high school basketball player who shelved his hoop dreams to hit it big with Puff Daddy’s Bad Boy Records. After his 1997 debut album, <i>Harlem World,</i> went quadruple platinum, he asked Loon to anchor a rap group also named Harlem World. There was a problem: Loon and Mase were engaged in a cold war of sorts. The two rappers shared a similar voice and flow, which in the provincial world of Harlem—and hip-hop in general—was a violation. Still, Loon joined forces with his longtime frenemy. The group’s album tanked, and Mase left the music industry for the church shortly thereafter.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_958/storage/images/media2/images/playboyintus1609_article_096_01_02/13329-1-eng-GB/playboyintus1609_article_096_01_022.jpg\" width=\"549\" height=\"568\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"playboyintus1609_article_096_01_02\" title=\"playboyintus1609_article_096_01_02\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p>Loon (right) in 2003 with music industry legend L.A.

Then, in the summer of 2000, he found himself in Miami, writing for Puff Daddy’s upcoming album <i>The Saga Continues…</i>. It was an important comeback attempt for Bad Boy following the Notorious B.I.G.’s death, Mase’s retirement and the disappointing sales of Puff’s previous album, <i>Forever.</i> Nothing was left to chance. At Circle House Studios, a blackboard loomed on the wall, marked with song titles and progress reports denoting which songs were complete and which needed verses or hooks. “I saw an opportunity in that blackboard,” Muhadith says. What was meant to be a four-day gig stretched into a two-week-long residency that produced 11 songs and a relationship that would alter both of their careers. Loon even postponed his wedding, scheduled for the week after he first arrived in Miami, to write for Puff.</p>\n<p>“Every day he said he was coming home. Finally I was like, ‘All right, what is going on?’ He was like, ‘I can’t leave. I have to finish this album.’ This was days before the wedding,” says his wife, Nona Crowd. “He convinced me we weren’t canceling the wedding, just postponing it, because this was his big chance.” The wedding was postponed for nearly nine years.</p>\n<p>Puff was impressed with Loon’s drive. “Puff loved the work ethic—well, Puff likes whoever can make him money,” says Loon’s former Harlem World group mate Michael “Blinky Blink” Foster. “He also likes people who don’t complain. If Puff didn’t like what he wrote, Loon would just write another verse.”</p>\n<p>The two Harlemites shared more than ambition: Their fathers, it turned out, had been friends—and largely absent from both of their lives. Puff was three years old when his father, a hustler named Melvin Combs, was murdered; Burger died of cancer when Loon was a teen. Puff and Loon bonded, and one night in the studio Puff spilled his guts about his recent breakup with Jennifer Lopez. “This was a broken guy,” Muhadith says. “He’s telling me the story of him and J. Lo. ‘I lost my girl. I got it all and no one to share it with.’ Then it hits me.” Loon took Puff’s tragedy—the personal anecdotes, the feelings, the emotions—and crafted “I Need a Girl (Part One),” a post-breakup love letter from Puff to J. Lo for the entire world to hear.</p>\n<p><i>First we were friends then became lovers</i></p>\n<p><i>You was more than my girl, we was like brothers</i></p>\n<p><i>All night we would play fight under covers</i></p>\n<p><i>Now you gone, can’t love you like I really wanna</i></p>\n<p><i>But every time I think about your pretty smile</i></p>\n<p><i>And how we used to drive the whole city wild</i></p>\n<p><i>Damn I wish you would’ve had my child.…</i></p>\n<p>“I Need a Girl (Part One)” and its sequel, “I Need a Girl (Part Two),” both featuring Loon, were Puff’s biggest hits in years, peaking at number two and number four respectively on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. Bad Boy Records was back, armed with a new star. “Loon gave Bad Boy a boost,” says former Hot 97 DJ Mister Cee. “ ‘I Need a Girl’ dominated radio. It got the Bad Boy train rolling again.”</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_958/storage/images/media2/images/playboyintus1609_article_096_01_04/13315-1-eng-GB/playboyintus1609_article_096_01_042.jpg\" width=\"658\" height=\"499\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"playboyintus1609_article_096_01_04\" title=\"playboyintus1609_article_096_01_04\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p>Loon (left) with Puff Daddy at the premiere of <i>Bad Boys II</i> in New York City in 2003.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p> At first glance, Loon seemed to be a perfect fit for Bad Boy. Cool, cocky and handsome, he personified turn-of-the-millennium Harlem swag. His music also slotted nicely into the space left vacant following Mase’s departure: sly wordplay and a lethargic flow—which, yes, was similar to Mase’s—over bubbly production built for the clubs.</p>\n<p>Loon’s ascent continued with cameos on hit records from Mario Winans, Toni Braxton and 3LW, but the business of music interfered when Bad Boy’s transition from Arista to Universal delayed his solo album. There were also artistic differences. Loon was uncomfortable being the label’s token dreamboat rapper—“the wedding singer,” as he calls it—and yearned to make grittier records similar to his 1995 single, “Scotch on the Rocks,” or “You Made Me” from the Harlem World album. But, he says, Puff frowned whenever Loon strayed from his lane.</p>\n<p>Released in October 2003, Loon’s self-titled debut was a modest success, peaking at number six on the Billboard 200 before plummeting. He believes the album wasn’t promoted or marketed properly because, he says, he was receiving a higher percentage of royalties than most Bad Boy artists. “I had a few heated moments with Puff. I wanted to fight him,” Muhadith says. “But I liked Sean John Combs; I wasn’t really a Diddy fan.” In December 2004, he left Bad Boy “on a good note.” (Combs and Bad Boy president Harve Pierre declined requests to comment.)</p>\n<p>Loon grew frustrated as he attempted to reignite his career out from under the shadow of Bad Boy. Performances and royalties paid the bills, but he lived check to check. He was drinking more, smoking more weed, playing video games all night. In interviews he lashed out at Mase and others. He hit the rapper 40 Cal with a shovel during an altercation at a Harlem barbershop. He felt overwhelmed: A hit record meant he’d have to write another hit record and another after that. There was no end in sight.</p>\n<p>“I was empty,” Muhadith says. “I hadn’t cried in a long time. I hadn’t felt anything in a long time.” He was searching for something, and he found it early one morning while on tour in Abu Dhabi.</p>\n<p>The story of how Loon converted to Islam is neat and convenient, almost like a superhero origin story. From his balcony at the Emirates Palace hotel, he saw three seagulls flying in the distance. When he went inside to unpack, the three seagulls landed on his balcony. “Something really special was happening in my heart,” Muhadith says. His mind swam with the recent positive exchanges he’d had with Muslims in Senegal, Kazakhstan and Dubai. The solution to his problems became clear. He ran to the lobby, asking, “How do I become a Muslim?” A man led him in reciting the <i>shahada,</i> the Muslim profession of faith.</p>\n<p>From then on he decided to abstain from past sins—drugs, alcohol, adultery and music. Crowd saw an immediate difference. “He was more caring, honest. He paid more attention,” she says. “Seeing the changes he was making was an inspiration.”</p>\n<p>Being a Muslim in Butner isn’t that bad, Muhadith says. Inmates can prepare their own food and are provided with a meal before dawn during Ramadan. As the prison imam, Muhadith continues to study Islam and teaches Arabic.</p>\n<p>“You see this guy behind us? Military guy,” he tells me without lowering his voice. “He said some derogatory remarks about Muslims that got back to me. I didn’t get mad. I approached him and said, ‘Seventy-two percent of Americans have never met a Muslim. Is it safe to say that you’re one of them?’ ”</p>\n<p>Muhadith places his hand on my shoulder. “Look, I don’t want people to think I’m a square,” he says. “I’m not a holy roller. I still have a personality. I still have a sense of humor.” His high-pitched giggle and deadpan wit—“It’s my cheat day,” he says when selecting an Almond Joy from the vending machine—are apparent. “I just have boundaries. Before, I had no boundaries.”</p>\n<p> Soon after his spiritual awakening, Muhadith’s life took another significant turn. For years he’d heard whispers that Joseph “Jazz” Hayden, a former associate of Nicky Barnes’s who’d served 13 years for manslaughter, was his biological father. After hanging out with Hayden, Muhadith noticed similarities. “Something about his style,” he says, “the way he walked, the way he talked.” Muhadith hopes to take a DNA test soon.</p>\n<p>Who does he think is his father, Burger Hughley or Jazz Hayden? “I don’t know. I’m 41 years old and I’m not sure who my father is,” he says. “It doesn’t matter. Both are hood royalty.” He then smiles. “Ask my mom. I’m curious what she’d say.”</p>\n<p>Two weeks later, I meet Carol Hawkins on the corner of 116th Street and Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard, outside the First Corinthian Baptist Church, where she worships.</p>\n<p>She wears furry Steve Madden boots, khakis and a plaid shirt with a cream wool sweater coat over it. Her hair is pulled back in a tight ponytail. We drive uptown in her black Nissan Pathfinder before parking on 148th Street in front of Esplanade Gardens. Then she tells the story of how she met Nicky Barnes.</p>\n<p class=\"pullQuote\"><b>“I TOLD HER, ‘IF YOU STOP USING DRUGS, I’LL STOP SELLING DRUGS, BECAUSE YOU ARE ABOUT TO GET ME KILLED.’ I LEFT THE STREETS.”</b></p>\n<p>One day on her way home from tennis, she spotted a handful of police officers with binoculars at a gas station on 150th Street. As she walked toward her building, she recognized Barnes, by that point a notorious neighborhood figure, at the bus stop. She warned him about the surveillance and offered to hide his stash in her parents’ apartment. “Ever since then, I was holding drugs,” she tells me. “After I started making all that money, I didn’t want to go to school no more.”</p>\n<p>She met Burger Hughley soon after. He was older, at least 15 years her senior, and he showered her with money, clothes and attention. The fact that he was married didn’t affect the relationship. “I wouldn’t have cared if he had five wives,” Hawkins says. “He was making me happy.”</p>\n<p>The drug game was lucrative, and Hawkins soon owned fur coats, a Cadillac, a Mercedes. Sometimes they’d drive to the airport and, on a whim, pick somewhere warm to fly. San Juan, Vegas and Acapulco were among their favorite destinations. When I ask her what specifically the money was like, all she can do is look up and mutter, “Oh God, oh man.” A beat passes before she turns and says, “I used to make more than $20,000 a day.”</p>\n<p>It didn’t last, of course. “I got up with that crack,” she explains. After her son’s proposition—he’d stop selling drugs if she’d stop using them—Hawkins went to rehab in Rochester, New York, where she found God. She is now sober and works for a community health organization. A devout Christian, she tells me she’s nothing but supportive of Muhadith’s conversion to Islam. “He has found peace in his life,” she says. “He found a god he loves and serves. Even though he calls him Allah, he’s the same God I love and serve.”</p>\n<p>I ask if she knows definitively who fathered Muhadith. “No, I don’t, to be honest,” she says, speaking deliberately. “I do know for sure that I was in Vegas with Jazz and the math added up to Jazz, but I didn’t want to hurt Burger’s feelings because he was walking around being such a proud dad. I don’t know. I was young. I made an executive decision to just say that it was Burger. It kept away a lot of hurt and explaining.” Hayden, now a community activist, did not respond to e-mails.</p>\n<p>We sit quietly in the Pathfinder. Then she calls her parents. “You wanna go up and meet them?” she asks me.</p>\n<p>Hawkins exits her car gingerly. She’s 61, and her knees are shot. As we make our way to the entrance, she gives an improvised tour of Esplanade Gardens. “This is the smoking corner,” she says. “It was my smoke corner, then my kid’s, then my kid’s kids.”</p>\n<p>On the 27th floor sits the Hawkinses’ three-bedroom apartment; a balcony offers stunning views of Harlem to the west and Yankee Stadium to the north. “My mother loves them damn Yankees,” Hawkins says. And here she is, Miss Hawkins, 86 years old but still going strong. She wears a shirt that reads wHEN GOD CLOSES A DOOR, HE OPENS A WINDOW. She makes sure I see the ASCAP award her grandson won for “I Need a Girl.”</p>\n<p> Miss Hawkins plans to write a character letter for Muhadith later in the week. “Oh God, I miss him,” she says. “He calls me, sometimes twice a week. I said, ‘You see this situation you in now? That’s what I tried to get you to bypass. That’s why I worked so hard with you. That’s why I brought you up in the church.’ I was very disappointed with his situation.”</p>\n<p>Later, on our way out, Carol Hawkins greets nearly every person she passes.</p>\n<p>“You know everyone,” I joke.</p>\n<p>“Yeah,” she says. “I been round here a long time.”</p>\n<p> Although he’s not scheduled for release until August 2021, Muhadith is doing everything he can to expedite things. He has applied for executive clemency, a pardon that would arrive during President Obama’s final days in office. It has happened before—George W. Bush pardoned John Forté, the ex–Fugees associate who was serving 14 years in prison for smuggling cocaine.</p>\n<p>Muhadith already has plans for when he’s a free man. He’ll reestablish his relationship with his wife, who works as a chef in North Carolina and visits him regularly, and his seven children, and he hopes to return to the lecture circuit to share his story with Muslim youth. A move overseas, once it’s possible, is more than likely. He won’t write or record new music, though he does admit to sometimes thinking about rap, comparing the sensation to what a recovered alcoholic must feel when walking past a liquor store. And sometimes it’s unavoidable. At one point during the afternoon, the visitation-room radio blasts “Mo Money Mo Problems” by the Notorious B.I.G., Mase and Puff Daddy.</p>\n<p>Muhadith was disappointed to learn about the current Bad Boy reunion tour. “What kind of reunion will it be?” he asks. A fair question considering Biggie is gone, Craig Mack has reportedly joined a religious cult, and Loon and G. Dep are incarcerated. When asked why so many former Bad Boy artists either find religion or become incarcerated (or, in Muhadith’s case, both), he says, “I don’t attribute it to Puff. Being on Bad Boy you’re riding this tidal wave that you can’t prepare for. Like most people who ride waves of that magnitude, they often wipe out.”</p>\n<p>The wave no longer appeals to Muhadith, but the fame is residual. Just before visiting hours end, a young inmate and his girlfriend—long black wavy hair, green eyes, ballet flats, skinny jeans, stunning curves—approach Muhadith. “Hey, man, she saw you and wanted to meet you,” the other inmate says. Muhadith appears embarrassed. The woman is starstruck, standing on her toes, head tilted, big smile, giggling nonstop. “Uh-oh, I better watch her around you,” her boyfriend cracks.</p>\n<p>Muhadith laughs afterward. The encounter reminds him of a past that shaped him but no longer defines him. “This whole situation has been a purification for me,” he says. “My life from the streets to the music industry was always ripping and running. It was nonstop. This has become a vacation. Am I over this vacation? Yeah, I am.”</p>\n","layout":{},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":0,"link_source":"","competition":[],"flatplan_title":"","notes":"","gutter_credit":"","other":"","image":[{"id":"zinio_playboyintus1609_article_096_01_image_0_1471453219.7506","name":"playboyintus1609_article_096_01_01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_958/storage/images/media2/images/playboyintus1609_article_096_01_01/13336-1-eng-GB/playboyintus1609_article_096_01_012.jpg?t=default_ipad_portrait&ext/playboyintus1609_article_096_01_012_default_ipad_portrait.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"768","height":"928","legacy_id":"1461","is_default":true},{"id":"zinio_playboyintus1609_article_096_01_image_0_1471453219.7506","name":"playboyintus1609_article_096_01_01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_958/storage/images/media2/images/playboyintus1609_article_096_01_01/13336-1-eng-GB/playboyintus1609_article_096_01_012.jpg?t=default_ipad_landscape&ext/playboyintus1609_article_096_01_012_default_ipad_landscape.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"635","height":"768","legacy_id":"1461","is_default":false}],"related_objects":{"image":[{"id":"zinio_playboyintus1609_article_096_01_image_3_1471453217.4291","name":"playboyintus1609_article_096_01_04","source":"","caption":"<p>Loon (left) with Puff Daddy at the premiere of <i>Bad Boys II</i> in New York City in 2003.</p>\n","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_958/storage/images/media2/images/playboyintus1609_article_096_01_04/13315-1-eng-GB/playboyintus1609_article_096_01_042.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"658","height":"499","legacy_id":"1458"},{"id":"zinio_playboyintus1609_article_096_01_image_3_1471453217.4291","name":"playboyintus1609_article_096_01_04","source":"","caption":"<p>Loon (left) with Puff Daddy at the premiere of <i>Bad Boys II</i> in New York City in 2003.</p>\n","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_958/storage/images/media2/images/playboyintus1609_article_096_01_04/13315-1-eng-GB/playboyintus1609_article_096_01_042.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"658","height":"499","legacy_id":"1458"},{"id":"zinio_playboyintus1609_article_096_01_image_2_1471453218.1242","name":"playboyintus1609_article_096_01_03","source":"","caption":"<p>Now known as Amir Junaid Muhadith, Loon resides in the Butner Federal Correctional Complex in North Carolina.</p>\n","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_958/storage/images/media2/images/playboyintus1609_article_096_01_03/13322-1-eng-GB/playboyintus1609_article_096_01_032.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"549","height":"568","legacy_id":"1459"},{"id":"zinio_playboyintus1609_article_096_01_image_2_1471453218.1242","name":"playboyintus1609_article_096_01_03","source":"","caption":"<p>Now known as Amir Junaid Muhadith, Loon resides in the Butner Federal Correctional Complex in North Carolina.</p>\n","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_958/storage/images/media2/images/playboyintus1609_article_096_01_03/13322-1-eng-GB/playboyintus1609_article_096_01_032.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"549","height":"568","legacy_id":"1459"},{"id":"zinio_playboyintus1609_article_096_01_image_1_1471453218.9376","name":"playboyintus1609_article_096_01_02","source":"","caption":"<p>Loon (right) in 2003 with music industry legend L.A.
