Regardless of how much you may admire your old man’s 1970s sense of fashion after bingeing on the dearly departed HBO show <i>Vinyl,</i> you wouldn’t dare pair one of those psychedelic shirts with a Tom Ford suit in 2016.</p>\n<p>Well, at least you shouldn’t.</p>\n<p>Fiat seems to get it, which makes the return of its iconic roadster to the U.S., in the form of the 2017 Fiat 124 Spider, so special.</p>\n<p>The new spin on the classic Italian convertible not only recaptures the spirit that has made the car a hot collectible 50 years after its introduction, but it also sells you on the idea even if you aren’t a fan of the previous models. Some may want to write the new Spider off as simply a rebadged fourth-generation Mazda Miata, but rest assured: This Italian roadster is a completely different animal from its Japanese counterpart, despite the two cars’ shared platform.</p>\n<p>Nowhere does this become more apparent than behind the wheel of the 124 Spider Abarth (pictured). Of the three new Spider variants (not counting the Prima Edizione, a limited offering of 124 vehicles), the Abarth is by far the more sinister interpretation of the convertible. The other two models are the Classica, a purer, entry-level version, and the more premium Lusso, which means “luxury” in Italian.</p>\n<p>All three come with a turbocharged four-cylinder engine with basically the same amount of power: 164 horsepower and 184 pound-feet of torque in the Abarth, compared with 160 horsepower and 184 pound-feet of torque in the Classica and the Lusso. But the 124 Spider Abarth, which starts at a little over $28,000, is a far better fit for those drivers who prefer their classics with a little more edge.</p>\n<p>In addition to unique design cues such as gunmetal accents and matte-black lids, the Abarth features a number of performance enhancements, including a sportier Bilstein suspension system and a low-growling, quad-tip exhaust—both of which make it a lot more fun to drive.</p>\n<p>Fortunately this update also includes all the modern tech features we’ve come to expect: USB ports, Bluetooth, rear camera. About the only thing lacking is Apple CarPlay, but for a true sports car there are worse sins. Opt for the engaging short-throw standard six-speed manual transmission and you won’t even miss it.<i>—Marcus Amick</i></p>\n","layout":{},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":0,"link_source":"","competition":[],"flatplan_title":"","notes":"","gutter_credit":"","other":"","image":[{"id":"zinio_playboyintus1609_article_024_01_image_0_1471453154.4864","name":"playboyintus1609_article_024_01_01","source":"PHOTOGRAPHY BY CHANTAL ANDERSON","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_958/storage/images/media2/images/playboyintus1609_article_024_01_01/12442-1-eng-GB/playboyintus1609_article_024_01_012.jpg?t=default_ipad_portrait&ext/playboyintus1609_article_024_01_012_default_ipad_portrait.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"768","height":"506","legacy_id":"1355","is_default":true},{"id":"zinio_playboyintus1609_article_024_01_image_0_1471453154.4864","name":"playboyintus1609_article_024_01_01","source":"PHOTOGRAPHY BY CHANTAL ANDERSON","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_958/storage/images/media2/images/playboyintus1609_article_024_01_01/12442-1-eng-GB/playboyintus1609_article_024_01_012.jpg?t=default_ipad_landscape&ext/playboyintus1609_article_024_01_012_default_ipad_landscape.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"1024","height":"674","legacy_id":"1355","is_default":false}],"url_alias":"http://site-958.audiencemedia.com","type":"story","order":"7","folio_number":"24","folio_numbers":"24","pdf_page_index":"24","thumbnail":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_958/storage/images/media2/images/playboyintus1609_article_024_01_01/12442-1-eng-GB/playboyintus1609_article_024_01_012.jpg?t=tablet_story_thumbnail&ext/playboyintus1609_article_024_01_012_tablet_story_thumbnail.jpg","color":"FFFFFF","real_id":"1354","main_section_id":"68","ads":[]}],"type":null,"ads":[]}}
