In addition to experiencing the standard winter-is-coming heebie-jeebies, most anyone who cares about politics is worried that the end is nigh. Family dinners become battlegrounds; e-mail forwards provoke fistfights in office parking lots. The turmoil has a way of showing up on our pages and screens too, and sometimes the worlds we escape to are even worse than our own. Obviously there’s a certain amount of morbid titillation at work when we spend our free time reading about pandemics and watching zombies overtake civilization, but dystopian fiction can scratch a deeper itch—not only satisfying our escapist, world-building urges but reminding us of the beautiful things we’re capable of creating. Literary-fiction blockbusters of the past decade have looked at the worst-case scenario in ways that celebrate art while lamenting our baser impulses; see <i>Station Eleven, The Road</i> and <i>California,</i> to name a few.</p>\n<p>This fall, a new florescence of titles will take on the dystopian and the apocalyptic with varying dashes of gothic horror and fantasy.

Whitehead’s last novel, <i>Zone One,</i> is a highbrow zombie tale that delineates the horrors of “post-apocalyptic stress disorder.” Now the author looks backward, showing us that for true dystopia, you can’t beat our own past.
