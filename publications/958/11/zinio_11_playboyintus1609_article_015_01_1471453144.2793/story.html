For me, being an artist wasn’t just about self-expression; it was a way to survive. When I started my own clothing line, Violette, in 2008, it came out as a unisex brand. As much as we’re individuals, girls like a lot of the stuff guys like. I’ve never understood why brands don’t make the same clothes they make for guys in girls’ sizes. Even in the sneaker world, the idea for too long was to take the cool guy sneaker and ‘shrink it and pink it’ for women. In recent years, unisex clothing has become more of a conversation. The stigma is dissipating.”</p>
