    </div><p>Poke (poh-kay) has arrived on the mainland. The raw fish snack, which hails from Hawaii, exploded on the West Coast over the past year—Los Angeles alone has more than a dozen poke shops—and now it’s gone as far as Chicago and New York. “I took a family trip to Hawaii in 2012 and fell in love with the stuff,” says Drew Crane, who opened one of Manhattan’s first poke-dedicated restaurants, Wise-fish, in January. “It’s a real comfort food in Hawaii. People get it from liquor stores, delis and even Costco in round plastic containers to go.” At Wisefish, Crane dresses fish with shoyu and sesame oil to order, and serves it atop a foundation of rice or zucchini noodles. Customers can amp up the mixture with a variety of nontraditional mix-ins such as watermelon radish and sea beans. In sum, the great argument for why poke is here to stay: It satisfies those sushi cravings without denting the wallet, and you can make it at home (perhaps impressing a date in the process) with even the most rudimentary of knife skills. Pro tip: Poke goes great with corn chips.<i>—Julia Bainbridge</i></p>
