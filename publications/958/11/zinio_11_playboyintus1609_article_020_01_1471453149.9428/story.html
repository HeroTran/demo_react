    </div><p>You don’t need 27 blades and a subscription service to get a close shave. New versions of the redoubtably sleek safety razor give a design-worthy spin to the classic shaving implement. Unlike plastic razors, which can require excessive pressure, weightier metal razors do most of the work for you. And after the somewhat pricier start-up cost, double-edged blades are mere pocket change in comparison with expensive and elaborate cartridges. Plus, any one of these razors will look good on the bathroom counter when you inevitably leave it out.<i>—Vincent Boucher</i></p>
