    </div><h2><b>SLOW-MO &amp; ROBOTICS</b></h2><p><i> Monday Night Football</i> owes much of its i m m e d i a t e success to the filmic style and technical innovations of its first director, Chet Forte. Using about 10 strategically positioned cameras (twice the norm)—some mounted on golf carts, some handheld—as well as “shotgun” mikes to capture every call and tackle, Forte coaxed a stop-start sport into telegenic narratives. He also popularized several techniques including instant replay, slow motion, split screen, reaction shots, crowd shots and on-screen graphics. <i>MNF</i> has continued to innovate with high-definition technology, robotic goal-line cameras, and “next-gen stats” that track players via chips embedded in their uniforms.</p>
<h2><b> MONDAY, MONDAY</b></h2><p><i> MNF</i> quickly changed Monday nights in America. In 1970 <i>The New York Times</i> reported that increasingly empty restaurants were installing TVs and bowling leagues were switching game days. Overlake Hospital near Seattle joked that “no babies are to be born between seven and 10 on Monday nights.” PTA meetings were rescheduled, and according to <i>Variety,</i> sales of movie tickets “nose-dived.”</p>

    </div><h2><b>FOOT(BALL)NOTES</b></h2><p><i> Monday Night Football</i> first aired at nine P.M. Eastern on September 21, 1970, when “Broadway” Joe Namath (pictured) led the New York Jets into Cleveland’s Municipal Stadium (to be beaten by the Browns, 31–21). At the time, broadcasting football in prime time was a risk—one that CBS and NBC both fumbled. But ABC’s $8.5 million bet paid off, and <i>MNF</i> redefined both television and sports. The inaugural sponsors were a trio of American icons: Marlboro, Ford and Goodyear. On December 8, 1980, Howard Cosell broke the news of John Lennon’s murder during a Patriots–Dolphins matchup at the Orange Bowl: “Hard to go back to the game after that news flash.” In 1985, <i>MNF</i> televised one of football’s most gruesome injuries, the fracturing of Joe Theismann’s leg during a flea-flicker play. ABC’s run ended in 2005, after 555 games. The show migrated to ESPN, which signed an eight-year deal worth $1.1 billion annually. In 2011 ESPN re-upped its contract with the NFL for $1.9 billion a year—a 73 percent rise from 2005 and an astonishing 22,254 percent rise from 1970.</p>

<h2><b> THEME TUNES</b></h2><p><i> MNF’</i> first theme was a groovy slice of 1970s funk titled “Score,” composed by Charles Fox, the genius behind the <i>Happy Days</i> theme<i>.</i> This was followed by a porno-style ditty imaginatively called “Monday Night Football Theme” and then in 1989 by Johnny Pearson’s “Heavy Action,” with a driving beat and soaring strings. That same year Hank Williams Jr. adapted his hit “All My Rowdy Friends Are Coming Over Tonight,” which introduced <i>MNF</i> from 1991 until 2011, when Williams appeared to have compared President Obama to Adolf Hitler. This allowed <i>MNF</i> to return to “Heavy Action,” from which, let’s face it, the show should never have strayed.</p>
