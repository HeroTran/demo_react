The Windows 10 Creators Update started rolling out to the general public on April 11 via the standard Windows Update process, just like every other Windows 10 update. There’s no way for home users to opt out of the upgrade.</p>\n<p>That doesn’t necessarily mean you’ll receive it today, however; the Anniversary Update took about four months to propagate to 80 percent of Windows 10 users. Microsoft prioritizes newer PCs with optimal specs for Windows 10 first. If you’re the impatient type, you can manually kick off the Creators Update installation (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/cudinstall\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/cudinstall</a>) by using Microsoft’s Update Assistant. (Warning: Clicking that link will download an executable file for the Update Assistant, <a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/udassist\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/udassist</a>, to your PC.)</p>\n<h3><b>So what’s the big deal?</b></h3><p>Microsoft releases two major Windows 10 updates each year, and the Creators Update is the first of those.</p>\n<p>It includes some helpful quality-of-life changes, such as a high-level privacy dashboard, an easier setup process, and usability tweaks to various settings and features throughout the operating system. The Creators Update also packs in new goodies, the most notable being the Paint 3D app, native video game streaming, a Game Mode that improves gaming performance, and Edge support for native ebooks and 4K Netflix streams. And, oh yeah! Themes are back and better than ever.</p>\n<p>Seriously, there’s a lot of stuff in the new-look Windows 10. Check out <i>PCWorld</i>’s roundup of the Creators Update’s best new features (go. <a href=\"http://pcworld.com/cubestf\" target=\"_self\">pcworld.com/cubestf</a>) for much, much more.</p>\n<h3><b>Sweet! So it’s still free, right?</b></h3><p>Yep, free-as-in-beer free—at least if you’re already on Windows 10.</p>\n<p>Microsoft’s free upgrade offer for Windows 10 expired long ago, so if you’re still on Windows XP, Vista, 7, or 8, you’ll need to buy a fresh copy of Windows 10 before you can get the Creators Update. It’ll set you back $120 for Windows 10 Home (go. <a href=\"http://pcworld.com/w10home\" target=\"_self\">pcworld.com/w10home</a>) or $190 for the more capable Windows 10 Pro (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/w10pro\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/w10pro</a>), or more if you want it on a flash drive.</p>\n<p class=\"pullQuote\">Microsoft’s free upgrade offer for Windows 10 expired long ago, so if you’re still on Windows XP, Vista, 7, or 8, you’ll need to buy a fresh copy of Windows 10 before you can get the Creators Update.</p>\n<h3><b>Any catches?</b></h3><p>Not really, though the Windows 10 Creators Update is missing many of the highlight features (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/misscu\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/misscu</a>) Microsoft promised at its October reveal.</p>\n<p>Virtual reality and 3D creation were two of the major cornerstones of the Creators Update vision—the reason for its name!—but beyond the new Paint 3D app (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/pnt3d\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/pnt3d</a>) those features are largely AWOL.

AMD’s finally released its highly disruptive Ryzen chips, throwing down the gauntlet and challenging Intel’s supremacy in high-end computing.</p>\n<p>AMD’s new Ryzen chips include several CPUs (and CPU families) of various levels of potency. What’s more, Ryzen introduces a completely new motherboard platform, and the processors require different memory and coolers than their predecessors. There’s a lot to sift through—so let’s sift!</p>\n<p>Here’s everything you need to know about AMD’s Ryzen.</p>\n<h3><b>Meet AMD’s Ryzen CPUs</b></h3><p>Let’s begin with the stars of the show: the Ryzen chips themselves. AMD’s Ryzen chips will be split across three families. The top-of-the-line Ryzen 7 processors launched first, with 8 cores, 16 threads, and price points that undercut the comparable 8-core Intel Extreme Edition by a whopping $500. Sweet holy moly. The initial Ryzen 7 lineup consists of the $500 Ryzen 7 1800X, the $400 Ryzen 7 1700X, and the $330 Ryzen 7 1700.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0014-0158/170257-1-eng-GB/f0014-012.jpg\" width=\"590\" height=\"332\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0014-01\" title=\"f0014-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>High-level Ryzen 7</b> specs and prices.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div>\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0014-029/170250-1-eng-GB/f0014-022.jpg\" width=\"591\" height=\"311\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0014-02\" title=\"f0014-02\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>AMD’s Ryzen 5</b> chips will start at $169 for the 1400 and go up to $249 for the 1600X, staying within range of Intel’s Core i5.</p>\n <span class=\"credit\">\nIMAGES: MARK HACHMAN (TOP); AMD (BOTTOM)</span></figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>The more affordable Ryzen 5 series (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/ryz5price\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/ryz5price</a>) launched on April 11 with more variation among processors than you’ll find in the 7 series. The $249 Ryzen 5 1600X is a 6-core, 12-thread processor capable of boosting to 4GHz, the same max speed as the Ryzen 7 1800X. The $219 Ryzen 5 1600 is a 6-core, 12-thread chip that tops out at 3.6GHz. The rest of the Ryzen 5 lineup consists of quad-core, 8-thread CPUs, with the $189 Ryzen 5 1500X hitting 3.7GHz with boost and the $169 Ryzen 5 1400 hanging between 3.2GHz and 3.4GHz.</p>\n<p>Finally, the only thing AMD’s said about the more affordable Ryzen 3 chips is that they’ll launch at some point in the second half of the year. We’d expect these to challenge Intel’s Core i3 lineup.</p>\n<h3><b>Ryzen technologies</b></h3><p>AMD imbued Ryzen chips with SenseMI technology (go.pcworld.coms/sensmi) consisting of separate parts: Pure Power, Precision Boost, Extended Frequency Range (XFR), Neural Net Prediction, and Smart Prefetch.</p>\n<p>• <b>Pure Power</b> measures hundreds of on-chip sensors to optimize temperatures and power use while maintaining performance.</p>\n<p>• On the flip side, <b>Precision Boost</b> offers fine-grained, automated frequency control that can nudge performance up by 25MHz increments (versus 100MHz for Intel) to boost performance without consuming more power.</p>\n<p>• <b>Extended Frequency Range (XFR)</b> can nudge clock speeds past their official maximum if Ryzen detects advanced CPU cooling, such as liquid-cooling or liquid nitrogen, for your chip. At Ryzen’s launch XFR only adds a paltry 100MHz overclock in chips.</p>\n<p>• <b>Neural Net Prediction</b> examines your usage and “primes your processor to tackle your app workload more efficiently.”</p>\n<p>• <b>Smart Prefetch</b> works hand-in-hand with Neural Net Prediction, identifying how your applications behave and preloading data that it expects you to need for faster performance.</p>\n<p>Every AMD Ryzen processor can also be overclocked with a compatible motherboard. Chips with an “X” designation at the end support SenseMI’s Extended Frequency Range technology more than the others. The Ryzen 1600X, 1700X, and 1800X can boost an extra 100MHz and the Ryzen 5 1500X can add 200MHz to its top speed, while non-X CPUs have the potential for a mere 50MHz boost.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0015-0157/170243-1-eng-GB/f0015-012.jpg\" width=\"873\" height=\"259\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0015-01\" title=\"f0015-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>Icons for the</b> various SenseMI technologies.</p>\n <span class=\"credit\">\nIMAGE: AMD</span></figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div>\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0016-0161/170236-1-eng-GB/f0016-012.jpg\" width=\"873\" height=\"542\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0016-01\" title=\"f0016-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>The pinnacle of</b> AMD PC performance: the Ryzen 7 1800X and Radeon Fury X.</p>\n <span class=\"credit\">\nIMAGE: BRAD CHACOS</span></figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>Ryzen performance</b></h3><p>So how does it all work in practice? Well.

AMD’s chips went blow-for-blow or outright bested the $1,050 Core i7-6900K—Intel’s cheapest 8-core, 16-thread processor—in every content-creation and productivity task we threw at them, giving Ryzen downright outrageous price-to-performance value for folks who need more cores.</p>\n<p>And the 6-core Ryzen 5 1600X usurps Intel’s unlocked Core i5 as the new mainstream computing champion, as <i>PCWorld</i>’s Ryzen 5 review shows.</p>\n<p>You’d probably want a decent graphics card if you plan to game on Ryzen, too. Benchmarks revealed that while Ryzen isn’t bad at gaming whatsoever, it definitely lags behind Intel processors—even older ones—in raw frames per second in some games. That disparity’s most pronounced when you’re using modest graphics cards at 1080p resolution, or on a monitor with an especially high refresh rate.</p>\n<p>That said, the CPU gaming performance gap is felt less if you toss in more potent GPUs and crank the graphics and resolution to higher levels, since that effectively moves the system’s gaming bottleneck from the processor to your graphics card, “hiding” the AMD chip’s slower-than-Intel frame rates.</p>\n<p>AMD says gaming performance “will only get better” over time as more game developers optimize their titles for Ryzen. “CPU benchmarking deficits to the competition in certain games at 1080p resolution can be attributed to the development and optimization of the game uniquely to Intel platforms—until now,” AMD’s John Taylor told <i>PCWorld</i>.</p>\n<p>Not-so-coincidentally, AMD also announced a partnership with Bethesda the same week Ryzen launched, designed to implement the low-level Vulkan graphics API in multiple games. Early Ryzen-specific game optimizations (see page 120) have indeed greatly boosted performance, and AMD’s seeded hundreds of developers with Ryzen kits. Games released going forward seem more likely to account for Ryzen’s architecture out of the gate.</p>\n<p>Overclocking Ryzen chips can also provide significant performance increases in gaming. AMD’s even released a powerful, yet easy to use overclocking tool for the new chips. Check out PCWorld’s guide to Ryzen Master (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/ryzenmaster\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/ryzenmaster</a>) to dive into the performance-boosting, heat-increasing world of overclocking.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0017-0143/170229-1-eng-GB/f0017-012.jpg\" width=\"590\" height=\"387\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0017-01\" title=\"f0017-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>AMD’s Wraith Max</b> cooler.</p>\n <span class=\"credit\">\nIMAGE: BRAD CHACOS</span></figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>Streamers and YouTubers will no doubt appreciate Ryzen’s extra cores, as well. Ryzen 7’s major niche is productivity and content creation tasks.</p>\n<p>Finally, all Ryzen chips also support business-grade ECC memory out of the box—though it hasn’t been validated on the initial wave of consumer motherboards.</p>\n<p class=\"pullQuote\">Overclocking Ryzen chips can also provide significant performance increases in gaming.</p>\n<h3><b>What you need to upgrade for Ryzen</b></h3><p>Speaking of motherboards, you’ll need a new one for Ryzen. AMD’s ditching its old platforms and unifying its processors around motherboards using the new AM4 socket.</p>\n<p>Ryzen motherboards drag AMD systems into the current era, with support for modern amenities such as 10Gbps USB 3.1 gen. 2 ports, NVMe storage, M.2 SSDs, et cetera. There are several different chipsets available for AM4 motherboards that can significantly affect your system’s features, however. For example, A320 motherboards won’t let you overclock your processor, while multiple graphics cards are only supported by X370-based motherboards. Be sure to read <i>PCWorld</i>’s guide to AMD Ryzen motherboards (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/ryzenmboards\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/ryzenmboards</a>) for a no-nonsense breakdown of what each AM4 chipset offers.</p>\n<p>You’ll need more than a new motherboard though. With Ryzen, AMD systems are moving from DDR3 to faster, more energy-efficient DDR4 memory, so you won’t be able to transfer over the RAM from your old PC unless you’re migrating from an Intel Skylake, Kaby Lake, or recent Extreme Edition machine. The bad news: Memory is expensive this year.</p>\n<p>Ryzen’s performance is sensitive to memory speeds, so be sure to hop into your system BIOS and ensure your RAM is running at its advertised speeds. Most systems will run it at JDEC-standard 2133MHz by default rather than the rated timings and voltages for your specific kit. Be warned, though: Hitting high memory speeds can still be a bit finicky on AM4 motherboards, though BIOS updates planned for May aim to alleviate the issue. (AMD also pushed out a helpful BIOS update (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/ryzenbiosupd\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/ryzenbiosupd</a>) ahead of the Ryzen 5 launch.)</p>\n<p>You might need a new CPU cooler as well. The 1331-pin AM4 socket (so close to 1337!) has about 100 more pins than older AM3 boards, so it needs new mounting hardware, and hence, new coolers. Existing AM3 coolers that secure to the processor using clips rather than bolts through the motherboard should still work with Ryzen, however, and many third-party manufacturers of older AM3 CPU coolers will send you AM4 mounting brackets if you ask. If you’ve already dropped big money on cooling for an existing AMD system, the high-end Asus Crosshair VI Hero motherboard ($255 on Amazon) includes both AM3 and AM4 mounting holes to support all sorts of coolers.</p>\n<p>You might not need to worry about cooling if you buy the right processor, though. Every Ryzen chip besides the Ryzen 7 1800X, 1700X, and Ryzen 5 1600X ships with one of AMD’s Wraith coolers. The Ryzen 7 1700, Ryzen 5 1500X, and Ryzen 5 1600 include the Wraith Spire, while the Ryzen 5 1400 includes the Wraith Stealth. AMD hasn’t announced a retail option that includes the Wraith Max yet.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0019-0144/170222-1-eng-GB/f0019-012.jpg\" width=\"873\" height=\"584\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0019-01\" title=\"f0019-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>Gigabyte’s Aorus AX370-Gaming</b> 5 motherboard.</p>\n <span class=\"credit\">\nIMAGE: BRAD CHACOS</span></figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div>\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0020-0156/170215-1-eng-GB/f0020-012.jpg\" width=\"873\" height=\"289\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0020-01\" title=\"f0020-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>The various AMD</b> Wraith coolers available for Ryzen chips.</p>\n <span class=\"credit\">\nIMAGE: AMD</span></figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>Ryzen operating systems</b></h3><p>Windows 10 is the only Microsoft operating system supported by Ryzen. (Linux works, too.) You’ll still be able to install Windows 7 or 8 on a Ryzen PC if you want, but if something goes wrong—and that’s very possible with a new CPU architecture on a new motherboard platform—you won’t get any technical assistance from Microsoft, AMD, or anybody else. There won’t be any official Windows 7 drivers released for Ryzen, either.</p>\n<p>Ongoing support is something you definitely want with a fresh platform, too. For instance, AMD recently pushed out a Ryzen-optimized “Balanced” power plan (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/ryzenpowerplan\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/ryzenpowerplan</a>) for Windows 10 that helped the chips behave better with the operating system, improving performance in games by an average of 5 percent (and as much as 21.6 percent).</p>\n<h3><b>Ryzen performance tips and build guides</b></h3><p>That’s all you need to know about buying a Ryzen processor. But if you pick one up, there are several tweaks—some straight from AMD—that might help you eke out even more power from this fresh-faced new platform. (Once again: Overclocking can really bolster Ryzen’s speed.)</p>\n<p>Be sure to check out PCWorld’s 7 Ryzen tips and tricks (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/ryzenperftips\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/ryzenperftips</a>) to maximize your PC’s performance to discover which knobs to turn and settings to tweak to push the processors even further. Because for as well as Ryzen performs out of the box, a mere hour or so of fine-tuning can make it that much better.</p>\n<p>Still planning out your PC? <i>PCWorld</i>’s trio of Ryzen builds can also

With the S8, Samsung has returned to the flagship market in a big way, and assuming it doesn’t have any recall-level issues, it should rocket the company back to the head of the class.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0023-0153/170328-1-eng-GB/f0023-012.jpg\" width=\"873\" height=\"490\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0023-01\" title=\"f0023-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n <span class=\"credit\">\nIMAGES: MICHAEL SIMON</span></figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div>\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/common31/170321-1-eng-GB/common2.jpg\" width=\"39\" height=\"42\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"common\" title=\"common\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p>Watch the video at <a href=\"http://pcworld-us.audiencemedia.com\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/ss8hovid</a></p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>Pricing varies by carrier: Verizon is selling the S8/S8+ for $30/$35 a month for two years. That’s $720 or $840 dollars. At T-Mobile they’re $750/$850, respectively. The same pricing applies at AT&amp;T. Sprint customers will be able to lease the Galaxy S8 for $31.25 a month for 18 months ($562.50) or the S8+ for $35.42 a month for 18 months ($637.56). Note that Sprint has only released lease pricing, not purchase pricing. All preorders get a new GearVR with motion controller, but some carriers are offering other trade-in incentives and bonuses (like a free microSD card).</p>\n<p class=\"pullQuote\">Samsung has clearly used the Note7 debacle as motivation for the S8, and the result is a sexy, powerful handset that just might be the coolest phone ever made.</p>\n<p><b>Out of this world:</b> Samsung may have made us wait a few weeks longer than usual for the S8, but it’s been worth it. Samsung has clearly used the Note7 debacle as motivation for the S8, and the result is a sexy, powerful handset that just might be the coolest phone ever made. As you can see in our hands-on (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/galaxy8ho\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/galaxy8ho</a>), the S8 pretty much does everything you could possibly want a phone to do (and then some), but its design will steal the show.</p>\n<h3><b>Size matters</b></h3><p>With the Galaxy S8, Samsung set out to address “market barriers” and “consumer pain points,” most notably when it comes to form factor. Unlike the past couple Galaxy S releases, Samsung is going all-in on the Edge design, which it is now branded as an Infinity Display. To that end, it has created a new benchmark in the bezel wars, with an 83 percent screen-to-body ratio.</p>\n<p>The two sizes are 5.8 inches and 6.2 inches, both sporting a 2960x1440 resolution and a 570 and 529 PPI, respectively. Like the S7, the S8 is 8mm thick (with the S8+ being ever-so-slightly thicker at 8.1mm), but it’s just 6.5mm taller than the S7, despite having a screen that’s more than a half- inch bigger. And the larger model is only 8mm taller.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0025-0143/170314-1-eng-GB/f0025-012.jpg\" width=\"873\" height=\"550\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0025-01\" title=\"f0025-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>Left to right,</b> the Galaxy S7, S8, LG G6, and S8+.</p>\n <span class=\"credit\">\nIMAGES: MICHAEL SIMON</span></figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>All three colors (black, orchid gray, and silver) come with unified black front bezels, so fans of white might be disappointed. Under the hood there’s the long-expected Snapdragon 835 chip, 4GB of RAM, and 64GB of storage. SD card storage is supported, too. There’s also the same 12MP camera on the back (though Samsung says there will be improvements with image processing), and a new 8MP auto-focus front camera. The phones are once again IP68 water and dust resistant (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/iprating\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/iprating</a>).</p>\n<p>As rumored, the fingerprint sensor is tucked away next to the rear camera, but Samsung doesn’t think you’ll be using it as often as you do on other phones. It has built-in iris scanning and face detection for unlocking, as well as a haptic-enabled bottom bezel that serves as a virtual home button.</p>\n<h3><b>AI on board</b></h3><p>Samsung is also bringing its own digital assistant to the S8. Named Bixby, the service is designed to replicate the things you can do with touch for voice, letting you speak commands while also using augmented reality to scan devices with the camera, and supports more than 50 languages.</p>\n<p>Like its contemporaries, Bixby utilizes a female voice. It will work with “a handful of apps” at launch, and it’s intuitive enough to understand what you’re doing between voice commands. So if you ask to see your movies, it will take you there. Then you can tap to navigate to one, and say, “Play this,” and it will know what you’re referring to. A dedicated button above the volume rocker on the left side of the device will summon Bixby wherever you are, and you can also say “Bixby” to wake it up.</p>\n<p>While Bixby won’t be able to answer general-knowledge questions when it launches, an update will bring the functionality in the future. However, it will utilize a feature called Bixby Vision that lets you use the camera to scan items such as books and wine bottles to get AR-style shopping links and other details about them. You can also utilize the Bixby home screen to view a stream of your personal information, such as fitness stats, weather, and reminders.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0026-0151/170307-1-eng-GB/f0026-012.jpg\" width=\"873\" height=\"539\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0026-01\" title=\"f0026-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>Samsung’s new AI,</b> Bixby, will control things that you usually use your fingers to do.</p>\n <span class=\"credit\">\nIMAGE: MICHAEL SIMON</span></figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>Safe and sound</b></h3><p>Then, there’s the elephant in the room: battery safety. The Galaxy S8 has gone through Samsung’s new 8-point battery safety check, and it notes that the process represents “a commitment to innovate process and quality.” So, it’s confident that these batteries won’t explode.</p>\n<p>To that end, the battery in the Galaxy S8+ is the same 3,500 mAh size found in the Note7, while the smaller model comes with a 3,000 mAh one. Both models support wireless charging, IP68 water resistance, and for audio fans, Samsung has resisted the wireless-only trend, so there is a 3.5mm headphone jack. Additionally, there will be a pair of AKG earbuds in the box, which Samsung says are worth $99.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0027-0144/170300-1-eng-GB/f0027-012.jpg\" width=\"665\" height=\"447\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0027-01\" title=\"f0027-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>Samsung’s DeX is</b> a USB-C dock that connects to your monitor.</p>\n <span class=\"credit\">\nIMAGES: JORGE ARZAC</span></figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>Expanding universe</b></h3><p>The S8 is the center of a new strategy for Samsung that includes two new products, Samsung Connect and DeX Station. It’s all part of a new ecosystem that Samsung is building around the S8 that includes a refined productivity push.</p>\n<p>Samsung Connect Home is a 4x4 Mu-Mimo mesh Wi-Fi router system. Designed to connect to all of your Samsung and compatible devices, the system has a SmartThings Hub built into it with a new intelligent app to control those devices. For example, you can set an away mode that will dim the lights and start up your Powerbot vacuum when you leave the house.</p>\n<p>DeX Station is designed to be a “pocketable solution” that lets you use your phone as a mini computer, projecting your apps onto a monitor and using a Bluetooth or USB keyboard and monitor to operate them. The dock includes two old-school USB ports, as well as ethernet and HDMI ports. Once plugged into the circular dock, you can hook it up to an HDMI monitor and access your apps just as if you were sitting down at a PC.</p>\n<h3><b>Point and shoot</b></h3><p>There are also updates to the Gear VR and Gear 360 cameras. In addition to a tweaked color and design to accommodate the S8, the new headset includes a bundled controller like Google’s Daydream with four buttons and a touch screen. Designed for gaming, the Bluetooth remote will also be sold separately for S7, S6, and Note 5 users. Samsung says there are some 70 remote-ready apps already in development.</p>\n<p>The Gear 360 camera has a new design. Instead of a sphere, it’s now a small stick that’s pocketable and more travel-friendly. The battery is no longer removable, but the SD card still is, and you can now shoot in 4K resolution and live-stream in 2K.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0028-0145/170293-1-eng-GB/f0028-012.jpg\" width=\"572\" height=\"361\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0028-01\" title=\"f0028-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>The Galaxy S8</b> has a 5.8-inch screen while the larger S8+ has a 6.2-inch one.</p>\n <span class=\"credit\">\nIMAGES: MICHAEL SIMON</span></figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>Preorders for the S8 started on March 30.

\t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n <span class=\"credit\">\nIMAGES: ADAM PATRICK MURRAY</span></figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>ONE OF THE marquee features of the Galaxy S8 is Bixby, Samsung’s response to the Siris, Google Assistants, and Cortanas of the world. Billed as “a new way to interact with your phone,” Samsung has gone so far as to add a dedicated button on the side of the phone to summon its new assistant, and has integrated it deeply into the S8’s interface. There’s just one problem: You won’t be able to talk to Bixby at launch.</p>\n<p>In a statement released about a week before the April 21 launch of the S8, Samsung confirmed that its new AI assistant would be missing a key component. While it supported Vision, Home, and Reminder at launch, Bixby Voice won’t be included on U.S. models. Samsung says the feature will arrive “later this spring.”</p>\n<p>While the other Bixby features are available, you’ll need to use them as you would any other app. For the AR-syle Vision, you’ll find an icon in the camera app that will call on Bixby’s services for translation, QR code detection, landmark recognition, and shopping. And the Home screen, which is sort of like Google Now, will still learn your routine to display messages, upcoming events, weather, and news. You’ll also be able to set reminders, which “can include specific content like a video you want to watch when you get home,” though it’s not clear how it will work within apps without voice commands.</p>\n<p>Bixby Voice’s delay is surely frustrating but it’s not all that surprising. During Samsung’s hands-on demonstration (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/galaxy8ho\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/galaxy8ho</a>) of the service in late March, it showcased a controlled set of actions, and reporters weren’t allowed to test the feature. At the time, reps said the S8-exclusive service would support English and Korean languages at launch, with a goal of expanding it to more languages and devices. According to reports, Bixby will be able to converse in Korean at launch.</p>\n<p class=\"pullQuote\">While the other Bixby features are available, you’ll need to use them as you would any other app.</p>\n<p>Voice may only be part of what Bixby does, but in today’s AI world, it’s a major one. We’ve been trained to talk to our assistants, and we expect them to understand and respond as if we’re talking to one of our friends. Bixby not being able to understand English—at least enough to roll out for English-speaking users—is a major detriment to its adoption, which already faces serious competition in Google Assistant.</p>\n<p><b>Say what:</b> The Galaxy S8 is one of the most exciting phones in years, and the lack of Bixby Voice at launch isn’t likely to change many minds about it. It still has Google Assistant on board (which most people were probably going to use anyway), and in the long run, it’s better that Samsung delays the service rather than release something that doesn’t work well. But Samsung is betting big on Bixby being a key component of its ecosystem, so it needs to get it right.

The non-volatile memory was hyped as the next fast thing, promising “1,000X” the performance of today’s NAND-based SSDs with far higher density and lower cost than DRAM. 3D XPoint had me wondering just how it would reshape the PC down the road, when a computer could potentially have a simple 4TB of 3D XPoint memory doing it all, rather than 16GB of RAM and a hard drive. Apparently we have to be patient.</p>\n<p class=\"pullQuote\">Anyone who expected the first Optane drives to re-balance the galaxy is likely to be very disappointed with Intel Optane Memory.</p>\n<h3><b>Why you shouldn’t dismiss Optane</b></h3><p>Anyone who expected the first Optane drives to re-balance the galaxy is likely to be very disappointed with Intel Optane Memory. These first two Optane drives aren’t intended for enthusiasts, nor anyone with a beefy computer. They’re aimed at the huddled masses who still use traditional, spinning-platter hard drives. There are a lot of them: IDC data cited by Intel shows roughly 80 percent of desktop PCs in the world still use hard drives. (Full disclosure: IDC and <i>PCWorld</i> are separate business units of International Data Group.) They’ll continue to do so, too, because the cost per megabyte is so affordable.</p>\n<p>Add Optane Memory to a current PC, and drive performance will be exponentially better, Intel claims.</p>\n<h3><b>Optane Memory hands-on</b></h3><p>Intel let the media try Optane Memory during a recent briefing at the company’s Folsom, California campus. This was a controlled atmosphere: I was not allowed to take photographs or screenshots, and we were closely supervised by Intel staff. Take these observations with a grain of salt.</p>\n<p>I booted a NUC PC with a 2.5-inch hard drive to Windows 10, launched the GIMP photo editor, and recorded how long it took to load. I then shut down the NUC and inserted a 32GB Intel Optane Memory drive into the NUC’s M.2 slot. I booted back into Windows and launched GIMP. Then I shut down the NUC and booted back into Windows.</p>\n<p>Lather, rinse, repeat. With each duplicate task, the launching speed accelerated. The load time for GIMP, for example, dropped from about 14 seconds to 8 seconds, and then to 3 or 4 seconds as the Optane Memory cached the task.</p>\n<p>While Optane Memory’s mission echoes that of Smart Response Technology, it’s a far better implementation. Pairing the drive, or setting it up to cache the hard drive, is truly a snap. You simply fire up the Optane Memory utility, tell it to pair, and you’re done.</p>\n<p>Anyone who remembers the original Smart Response Technology can tell you it wasn’t so easy to use and was prone to pairing problems. Like SRT, Intel Optane Memory keeps parts of the OS on the drive to speed up performance. This means if you want to pull the hard drive from the system, you’ll have to unpair it first so you don’t jeopardize your data.</p>\n<p>The current Intel Optane Memory implementation is also limited to a single hard drive. If you run two hard drives, the second one will see no caching improvement. Very much like SRT, Intel Optane Memory increases responsiveness overall. Of course, anything is an improvement to a hard drive.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0035-0142/170450-1-eng-GB/f0035-012.jpg\" width=\"583\" height=\"280\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0035-01\" title=\"f0035-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>We previewed Optane</b> Memory running in an Intel Kaby Lake NUC.</p>\n <span class=\"credit\">\nIMAGE: INTEL</span></figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>Competing with SSD</b></h3><p>When the price of a 128GB SATA SSD is roughly $50 to $60 today, you may rightly wonder why Optane Memory would be worth the bother.

Intel Optane Memory would give that mainstream user the same or better performance as an SSD, with the capacity advantage of the 1TB or 2TB drive they’re used to.</p>\n<p>Intel claims Optane Memory performance is as good or better than an SSD’s, offering better latency by magnitudes and the ability to reach peak performance at much lower queue depths. (A queue depth is basically how long it takes the system to access data on the hard drive.) On the next page is an Intel slide that shows the traces of several consumer applications in use. You can see all of the action is with a queue depth of one, two, or three at the most.</p>\n<p>Intel says the problem with NAND SSD is in its method of increasing performance: Increasing the number of channels nets performance only at very high queue depths that consumers don’t reach.</p>\n<h3><b>You probably want the next drive</b></h3><p>What we all wanted to know, of course, is whether actual Optane SSDs aimed at consumers would come to market. Intel will only say that’s in the works.</p>\n<p>If Intel repeats its previous pattern of offering consumer drives based on its server products, some hints may lie in the launch of the DC P4800X—see the roadmap for Optane SSDs in the lower right-hand corner of the image.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0037-0144/170436-1-eng-GB/f0037-012.jpg\" width=\"729\" height=\"368\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0037-01\" title=\"f0037-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>Intel says the</b> overwhelming amount of drive access consumers perform are done at very low queue depths.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div>\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0037-027/170429-1-eng-GB/f0037-022.jpg\" width=\"729\" height=\"348\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0037-02\" title=\"f0037-02\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>Using 3DX Point</b> media, Intel’s Optane Memory can hit much higher performance than even SSDs at the low queue depths people actually use the computer at.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div>\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0038-0153/170422-1-eng-GB/f0038-012.jpg\" width=\"591\" height=\"307\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0038-01\" title=\"f0038-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>Intel has announced</b> a server Optane drive and plans for a consumer one.

hard drives as fast as SSDs, but apparently not if you bought a PC on the cheap.</p>\n<p>The superfast Optane Memory M.2 drives announced in late March not only require a Kaby Lake processor, but a Core one at that, as first spotted by <i>The Tech Report.</i> According to Intel’s ARK database and Optane website, Kaby Lake-based Celeron and Pentium processors aren’t supported.</p>\n<p>That’s puzzling because these new Optane Memory drives target mainstream PCs rather than enthusiast systems, supercharging the performance of a traditional hard drive. With an Optane M.2 drive installed, Intel promises speeds close to that of an SSD in some scenarios. The Optane Memory does this by caching your regular tasks, such as launching a particular program or game. The launch time then gets faster with each successive operation.</p>\n<p>It’s an interesting idea, and one that appeared easy to implement in Intel-controlled tests we performed at Optane’s launch event.</p>\n<p class=\"pullQuote\">But if this first round of Optane Memory is aimed at speeding up non-enthusiast PCs, why not support Celeron and Pentium?</p>\n<p>But if this first round of Optane Memory is aimed at speeding up non-enthusiast PCs, why not support Celeron and Pentium? Non-enthusiasts often buy cheaper PCs that are likely to be running these lower grade processors (and traditional hard drives) rather than the more expensive Core CPUs. Nobody’s reviewed these Optane cache drives yet but this restriction seems likely to narrow their potential audience.</p>\n<p><b>Why this matters:</b> While this first release of Optane Memory may not excite hard-core gaming enthusiasts, the future for the technology could still be bright. When Intel and Micron first announced 3D XPoint (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/micron3dxpt\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/micron3dxpt</a>)—the technology that Optane products use—the companies promised nothing short of a revolution. 3D XPoint could function as both volatile and non-volatile memory with 1,000 times the performance and endurance of NAND-based SSDs, they claimed.</p>\n<p>This first effort for consumer-grade Optane gear doesn’t come close to that. But with Optane SSDs for servers rolling out in 2017, who knows what the future will bring? The idea of a full-blown, stand-alone Optane SSD is still tantalizing indeed.</p>\n","layout":{},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":1,"link_source":"","competition":[],"flatplan_title":"","notes":"","gutter_credit":"","other":"","image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1494014977.1722","name":"f0039-01","source":"IMAGE: INTEL","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0039-0144/170486-1-eng-GB/f0039-012.jpg?t=default_ipad_portrait&ext/f0039-012_default_ipad_portrait.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"768","height":"527","legacy_id":"17837","is_default":true},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1494014977.1722","name":"f0039-01","source":"IMAGE: INTEL","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0039-0144/170486-1-eng-GB/f0039-012.jpg?t=default_ipad_landscape&ext/f0039-012_default_ipad_landscape.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"1024","height":"703","legacy_id":"17837","is_default":false}],"url_alias":"http://pcworld-us.audiencemedia.com","type":"story","order":"6","folio_number":"39","folio_numbers":"39,40","pdf_page_index":"39","thumbnail":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0039-0144/170486-1-eng-GB/f0039-012.jpg?t=tablet_story_thumbnail&ext/f0039-012_tablet_story_thumbnail.jpg","color":"FFFFFF","real_id":"17836","main_section_id":"533","ads":[]},{"id":"zinio_245_100340926_1494014978.5747","title":"Dell’s wild 8K monitor goes on sale with a just-as-stunning price tag","sub_title":"","author":[{"id":"0","name":"IAN PAUL","email":"noreply@audiencemedia.com","is_default":false}],"tag":"","strap_line":"NEWS","intro":"","body":"<p class=\"byline\"><b> BY IAN PAUL</b></p>\n<p><b> THAT FANCY 4K</b> display you just bought is already obsolete.

The good news is 8K displays will likely drop in price within a few years, and as they become more commonplace, AMD and Nvidia will no doubt produce consumer GPUs built with 8K in mind.

But playing with 8K on PCs is a discovery process for Dell, which shipped the first-ever 8K display—the Dell 32 UltraSharp 8K Monitor—recently. The small initial stock of the $5,000 display sold out in a few days.</p>\n<p>The display won’t work on all PCs and needs specific hardware and display ports. But Dell is finding out that more hardware than it originally thought can handle 8K graphics, including AMD’s Radeon Pro WX 7100 workstation GPU (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/amdwx7100\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/amdwx7100</a>).</p>\n<p>The 32-inch display shows images at a resolution of 7680 x 4320 pixels. The monitor shows stunning colors and features 33.2 million pixels and more than a billion colors.</p>\n<p>But being first to market has its own shortcomings. The display has a 60Hz refresh rate, not enough for gaming or fast-moving video because new frames draw slowly. The monitor is mainly aimed at applications like image manipulation, engineering, and space exploration, where static and deeper images matter more.</p>\n<p>Dell willingly admits that this monitor isn’t for everyone or for all PCs. But the company is learning more as it works with GPUs, connectors, PC configurations, and drivers.</p>\n<p>There is only a handful of GPUs that support 8K. In early demonstrations of the monitor, Dell used a workstation with Nvidia’s GeForce GTX 1080 graphics card. AMD’s Polaris-based Radeon Pro WX 7100 workstation GPU can now be added to the small list of GPUs supporting the 8K monitor, said Michael Turner, manager for monitor products at Dell.</p>\n<p class=\"pullQuote\">The display has a 60Hz refresh rate, not enough for gaming or fast-moving video because new frames draw slowly.</p>\n<p>The 8K monitor has two DisplayPort 1.4 ports, and both need to hooked up to a PC to support the full 8K resolution. A single DisplayPort connection won’t achieve the 8K resolution.</p>\n<p>The PC and GPU running the monitor also need to support DSC (Display Stream Compression), so compressed 8K content can be delivered to the monitor via the two DisplayPort connections. Outside of the new high-end GPUs, many don’t support DSC, ruling out 8K support, Turner said.</p>\n<p>Standards-setting organizations are developing other connectors for 8K monitors and PCs. The new HDMI version 2.1 specification will support 8K at 60Hz, but Dell doesn’t have enough information about it yet to consider the technology. Intel’s superfast Thunderbolt 3 connector does not support 8K yet, Turner said.</p>\n<p>New details about the HDMI 2.1 specification for 8K could emerge at the upcoming NAB Show in Las Vegas.

While the original Xbox One utilized a mere 12 Radeon graphics cores clocked at a woefully slow 853MHz, Project Scorpio squeezes in 40 Radeon cores clocked at a whopping 1,172MHz. To put that in proper perspective, AMD’s Radeon RX 480 contains 36 cores that hum along between 1,120MHz and 1,266MHz. It’s like AMD and Microsoft crammed an entire $200 graphics card into Scorpio.</p>\n<p>The new Xbox console exists to bring native 4K gameplay to living rooms. 4K textures require crippling amounts of RAM, so Project Scorpio also received a substantial memory boost. The original console contained 8GB of pokey DDR3 memory with 32MB of faster ESRAM; Scorpio ups that to 12GB of the speedy GDDR5 memory you’ll find in modern PC graphics cards (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/pcgamingcards\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/pcgamingcards</a>), with an overall memory bandwidth of 326GB per second.</p>\n<p>That blows away the PS4 Pro’s comparatively ho-hum 218GBps, as well as the Radeon RX 480’s 224GBps. It’s most comparable to the Nvidia’s GeForce GTX 1080’s 320GBps—the graphics card PC gamers would want to get if they want to dip their toes in 4K gaming (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/4kgamingrig\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/4kgamingrig</a>).</p>\n<p>PC gamers wouldn’t want a Radeon RX 480 for 4K gaming, but Digital Foundry says Scorpio’s configuration works far better in practice, and not just because consoles tend to dial down graphics quality</p>\n<p>“From what I’ve seen so far, there is some evidence that Scorpio’s true 4K performance could pose a challenge to the likes of Nvidia’s GTX 1070 and AMD’s Fury X-class hardware,” Richard Leadbetter wrote, stating that he witnessed Forza Motorsport 6 running at 4K resolution and 60 frames per second with the equivalent of PC ultra settings. Microsoft chalked the enhanced performance up to consoles offering system access that’s more optimized than what you’ll find on PCs thanks to their fixed hardware designs.</p>\n<p>Like the Xbox One S—and unlike the PS4 Pro, crucially—Project Scorpio’s 4K chops won’t be limited to gaming alone. The next-gen Xbox console will also play 4K Blu-ray discs in glorious high-dynamic range (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/hdrguide16\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/hdrguide16</a>) if you’ve got a compatible TV.</p>\n<p>But while all this 4K talk may reap headlines, the truth of the matter is 4K television adoption is still in its relative infancy. Most people still have 1080p or even 720p TVs. While the PS4 Pro’s haphazard guidelines result in haphazard game support for 1080p TV owners, Microsoft’s mandating downsampling for HD screens if a game offers a high-resolution mode, which would greatly increase visual quality. Game frame rates must also be as good or better than what you’ll find on a standard Xbox One. (Project Scorpio maintains compatibility with all Xbox One games.)</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0048-0155/170580-1-eng-GB/f0048-012.jpg\" width=\"383\" height=\"298\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0048-01\" title=\"f0048-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>Follow me (<a href=\"http://pcworld-us.audiencemedia.com\" target=\"_self\">twitter.com/BradChacos</a>)</b> for smart tweets!</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>Rounding things out, Microsoft also upped the hard drive size and CPU clock speeds in Project Scorpio.</p>\n<p>There are still plenty of question marks surrounding this potent next-gen Xbox.

Expect those to be answered long before Project Scorpio’s holiday 2017 launch—probably at E3 in June. And don’t expect it to come cheap. With specs like that, I’d wager it’ll set you back $500 or $600.</p>\n<p><b>The story behind the story:</b> Project Scorpio’s technical reveal leaves curious PC enthusiasts somewhat wanting. Digital Foundry’s deep-dive (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/df17scorpio\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/df17scorpio</a>)—which you should seriously read for even more nitty-gritty details details—didn’t explicitly state whether the redesigned APU utilizes AMD’s Polaris graphics cores, AMD’s forthcoming Vega graphics cores, or Polaris cores with a splash of Vega technology worked in (as is the case with Sony’s PS4 Pro).</p>\n<p class=\"pullQuote\">AMD’s new Ryzen processors lag behind Intel Core chips in gaming performance, but Ryzen-specific optimizations by game developers can greatly close that gap.</p>\n<p>More notably, Project Scorpio’s customized CPU cores are not based on AMD’s new Ryzen architecture. They’re still based on the ages-old Jaguar design. That directly affects PC gamers. AMD’s new Ryzen processors (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/ryzenrev\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/ryzenrev</a>) lag behind Intel Core chips in gaming performance, but Ryzen-specific optimizations by game developers can greatly close that gap. If Microsoft’s new console featured Ryzen cores, then major developers would have been required to optimize for Ryzen—though that likely would have complicated Scorpio’s required compatibility with the original Xbox One.

President Trump signed the bill into law, which means that anyone concerned about privacy will have to protect themselves against overzealous data collection from their ISP.</p>\n<p>Some privacy-conscious folks are already doing that—but many aren’t. If you want to keep your ISP from looking over your shoulder for data to sell to advertisers, here are three relatively simple actions you can take to get started.</p>\n<h3><b>Use HTTPS Everywhere</b></h3><p>The Electronic Frontier Foundation’s HTTPS Everywhere (<a href=\"http://eff.org/https-everywhere\" target=\"_self\">eff.org/https-everywhere</a>) browser extension is one of the first things you should install. This extension requires that all website connections to your browser occur using SSL/TLS encryption. That means the content of what you’re viewing will be protected from passive collection by your ISP. The only time the extension won’t force HTTPS is when the site you’re connecting to doesn’t support the protocol.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0052-0160/170623-1-eng-GB/f0052-012.jpg\" width=\"350\" height=\"105\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0052-01\" title=\"f0052-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>It’s a great little extension that starts working as soon as you install it. What it <i>doesn’t</i> do, however, is stop your ISP from seeing which sites you visit. Only the contents of your communication are protected. So your ISP will know you visited YouTube, but not what you watched while you were there, or the specific pages you visited. HTTPS Everywhere is available for Firefox (desktop and Android), Chrome, and Opera.</p>\n<h3><b>Get a paid virtual private network</b></h3><p>Your next step is to subscribe to a paid virtual private network service (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/vpnsafety\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/vpnsafety</a>)—not a free one that collects your data and sells it to third parties for analytics, or uses ads to support its free service, because that would negate the entire point of all this. You want a VPN that you pay to keep your data private. This should cost somewhere around $40 to $60 per year.</p>\n<p>A VPN is like an encrypted tunnel between you and the Internet. You connect directly to your VPN (a connection your ISP will see) and then all Internet browsing goes through the VPN’s servers and blocks third parties from snooping. Once you’ve picked and configured a VPN, set it to start up automatically and funnel all your Internet traffic through there.</p>\n<p>Choosing a VPN is a bit of a tricky business since you want a provider that collects and stores a minimum amount of data about your browsing. Freedome VPN (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/freedome\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/freedome</a>) pledges not to log your traffic and is run by F-Secure, an established and reputable name in Internet security. Some VPN providers offer helpful extra features, such as an Internet kill switch that immediately shuts off your PC’s Internet access when your VPN gets disconnected.</p>\n<p>You also want your VPN to protect against DNS leaks, which is a problem we’ll get to next.</p>\n<h3><b>Adjust your DNS</b></h3><p>The Domain Name System is how your computer translates a human readable website name, such as <a href=\"http://NYTimes.com\" target=\"_self\">NYTimes.com</a>, into a machine-friendly numerical Internet Protocol address. It’s like the telephone book of the Internet.</p>\n<p>The problem is that your PC is usually configured to use your ISP’s DNS, which means your ISP sees all your browser requests. VPNs typically configure your PC to use their DNS, and there is usually a DNS leak protection feature that makes sure your PC doesn’t ignore the VPN and use your default DNS settings.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, to be doubly sure you’re not using your ISP’s DNS, it’s a good idea to set your PC to use a third-party DNS provider such as OpenDNS (<a href=\"http://opendns.com\" target=\"_self\">opendns.com</a>). We have a tutorial from 2011 on how to change your DNS settings (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/chgdns\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/chgdns</a>) in Windows 7.

New users will need to pay $120 for Windows 10 Home (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/w10home\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/w10home</a>) or $200 for Windows 10 Pro (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/win10proamz\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/win10proamz</a>)—remember, Windows 10 <i>itself</i> is no longer free. Insiders already have the Creators Update, as the company recently confirmed, and we used the Insider build to write this review.</p>\n<p>It’s worth the upgrade. The Creators Update adds numerous new capabilities (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/w10up\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/w10up</a>) that Windows previously lacked. Check out Microsoft’s renewed commitment to PC gaming. Try the new, creative twists on Windows Ink (no stylus required—a mouse or touchpad will do), including the ability to write on videos (yes, videos) and maps. Take a second look at Microsoft’s Swiss Army knife, its Edge browser, which now offers 4K Netflix, ebooks, and more. Even Cortana has learned new tricks.</p>\n<p>Microsoft’s 3D vision is missing a key portion, and that’s a shame. Still, it doesn’t matter if you can barely draw a stickman, or own an aging PC with a three-button mouse—Microsoft made the Creators Update accessible to everyone, though you’ll certainly enjoy it more with a touchscreen and stylus.</p>\n<h3><b>A cool new experience from the get-go</b></h3><p>If you’re upgrading to a new PC equipped with the Windows 10 Creators Update, the new Cortana-driven, out-of-the-box experience (OOBE) is a charming introduction. Narrated almost exclusively by the actress Jen Taylor as Cortana, the OOBE is now voice-driven and almost entirely hands-free, orally asking you to agree to using Cortana, Windows’ default privacy settings, and the like. In all, the setup process took me about four minutes. You still have the freedom to toggle off targeted ads and other options, though Windows will immediately suggest a reason why you shouldn’t.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0069-0148/170957-1-eng-GB/f0069-012.jpg\" width=\"492\" height=\"413\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0069-01\" title=\"f0069-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>The Windows OOBE</b> includes a streamlined privacy setup process.

Adding a Logitech mouse to my test bed prompted Windows to search out Logitech’s associated software. Device setup now takes place behind the scenes, so Windows will notify you that you can use a new device within just a second or two. I also like how the Creators Update adjusts your display resolution or monitor setup automatically instead of asking you to approve the process.</p>\n<p>And then there’s the “oh, wow!” moments: Windows Hello and Themes. Setting up facial authentication is done almost before you’re aware it’s taken place. Recognition is almost instantaneous, too. (I just wish there were a consistent way to sign in to multiple Microsoft services at once. Cortana offered to sign me in to “all Microsoft apps” within Windows, but it didn’t take.)</p>\n<p>Do <i>not</i> overlook Themes, either. For too long Windows has been shackled to generic default backgrounds. With the new Themes packs inside the Windows Store, you can get a glorious nature- (or cat-) inspired background, including optional sounds. Windows even displays different backgrounds on different monitors.</p>\n<h3><b>Gamer gifts: Game Mode, Beam game streaming</b></h3><p>Though Microsoft has invested heavily in the Xbox One game console (whose own Windows 10 Creators Update features are now live), Microsoft’s made two key additions for PC gamers: Game Mode and Beam.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0070-0154/170943-1-eng-GB/f0070-012.jpg\" width=\"873\" height=\"494\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0070-01\" title=\"f0070-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>Boring Windows desktops</b> are a thing of the past with Windows 10 Creators Update’s new Themes.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div>\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0071-0154/170936-1-eng-GB/f0071-012.jpg\" width=\"590\" height=\"293\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0071-01\" title=\"f0071-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>Download a game</b> from the Windows Store, and you’ll now see a progress bar.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>Remember when games like the original DOOM required tweaking HIMEM.SYS and other startup files to eke out every last bit of performance?

Streaming with Beam is pretty simple: Open the Game Bar (Win-G, or the Xbox button on an attached controller) then navigate to the Broadcast icon. I had previously set up a Beam account on the website, but Beam never asked for it—it used my Xbox Live account name instead.</p>\n<p>Streaming with Beam lets you play a game as an interactive performance, chatting with strangers about what’s going on. Strangers may criticize, praise, or even pay you for your efforts. Beam’s hardware impact may require further testing, though: As you can see from the raw benchmark scores, Beam streaming chopped quite a bit off my laptop’s CPU performance.</p>\n<h3><b>Windows Ink rejuvenates Photos and Maps</b></h3><p>Microsoft had little to show for Windows Ink in the Anniversary Update. In the Creators Update, however, inking is actually fun. Within the Photos app, you can add ink annotations—comments, smiley faces, the works—and the ink will save to a separate copy of the file. Even setup is smoother: As I was inking, Windows popped up a notification to set up the pen.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0073-0160/170908-1-eng-GB/f0073-012.jpg\" width=\"730\" height=\"407\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0073-01\" title=\"f0073-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>Gears of War 4</b> benchmark and settings continued.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div>\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0074-0162/170901-1-eng-GB/f0074-012.jpg\" width=\"591\" height=\"424\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0074-01\" title=\"f0074-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>Inking on Photos</b> is fun, but doesn’t have the verve of inking on videos.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>Inking saves an inked photo as a “living image” within Photos, essentially a brief video where the ink spontaneously appears.

Add those, though, and Microsoft could regain some of the playful fun that’s been missing from Windows for a decade.</p>\n<p>One of the features Microsoft seems proudest of—inking two points within Maps, which then calculates the distance—I initially dismissed as useless. Tracing a trailhead or creek and calculating the distance, though, has merit. (You can either use Ink’s older straight edge—which now tracks angles—or a second, circular “protractor” that helps draw arcs.) What Microsoft doesn’t really make clear is that you can draw a similar line between two points, and Maps will then calculate the street route between them. That’s much cooler, and something Google doesn’t offer.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0075-0150/170894-1-eng-GB/f0075-012.jpg\" width=\"731\" height=\"465\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0075-01\" title=\"f0075-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>Here, I’ve shown</b> Maps calculating distance as the crow flies (pink) versus a calculated route (blue).

It’s a shame, then, that much of it falls short.</p>\n<p>You may not even be aware that Windows already hides a robust suite of tools to import, create/edit, view, and print 3D objects: 3D Scan, View 3D, and 3D Builder all cooperate to provide a 3D content-creation tool chain throughout Windows. All of them were already there within Windows 10, and Paint 3D joins them with the Creators Update.</p>\n<p>The Achilles heel here is 3D content creation. Last October, Microsoft promised—heck, even <i>demonstrated</i>—a Capture 3D app (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/c3d\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/c3d</a>)that used a mobile phone camera to 3D-scan an object as easily as taking a movie. And…where is it? Missing in action. Are 3D objects in Office? Nope. I spent hours with the built-in 3D Scan app, connecting a Kinect depth camera to a Surface Studio and attempting to scan 3D objects, including myself. Those attempts failed miserably, resulting in an “object” that looked more like a puddle.</p>\n<p>Paint 3D, on the other hand, is one of the triumphs of the Creators Update. It encourages you to create simple 3D objects with a variety of textures, or incorporate more complex objects from the Remix 3D community site. (Want more?

Here are the four key additions: the ability to import favorites from other browsers, new tools to organize tabs, Edge’s debut as an e-reader, and Edge’s upgraded ability to play Netflix at 4K resolutions.</p>\n<p>Reading books via Edge is functional (check out our hands-on experience, <a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/ebookedge\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/ebookedge</a>), lacking some conveniences but offering a reasonable alternative to an app or an e-reader. As for Microsoft’s 4K Netflix claims—yes, we’ve proven they’re true (go. <a href=\"http://pcworld.com/edgenetflix4k\" target=\"_self\">pcworld.com/edgenetflix4k</a>), and no other PC browser can say the same.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0078-0152/170866-1-eng-GB/f0078-012.jpg\" width=\"873\" height=\"511\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0078-01\" title=\"f0078-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>The under-the-hood tools</b> within Netflix allowed us to prove that yes, Edge is the only PC browser to play Netflix streams at 4K.</p>\n <span class=\"credit\">\nALL IMAGES: MARK HACHMAN</span></figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>A new feature in Edge, the ability to set aside a tab or groups of tabs, is useful but needs refinement. Let’s say that you began researching a trip to Hawaii, opened a few tabs on what to see or do in the islands, then called it a night. Normally, you might bookmark the tabs for a later date. Edge allows you to take that group of tabs and “tombstone” them on the left rail. Each time you set the tabs aside, a new group is formed—which you can’t label or add to, unfortunately. Each group of tabs can be reloaded whenever you want, even after a reboot. A somewhat related feature lets you preview tabs as thumbnails.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0079-0155/170859-1-eng-GB/f0079-012.jpg\" width=\"873\" height=\"391\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0079-01\" title=\"f0079-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p>Edge’s Book e-reader gets the job done.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div>\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0079-028/170852-1-eng-GB/f0079-022.jpg\" width=\"662\" height=\"308\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0079-02\" title=\"f0079-02\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p>Tabs can be set aside and restored using the icons in the upper right-hand corner of Edge.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>You can supposedly import favorites/bookmarks as well as passwords from the two most popular browsers, Internet Explorer and Google Chrome. At least with Chrome, bookmarks imported just fine, though I had to reorganize them a bit.

Notably, it now boasts a total of 25 Edge extensions in the Store, including new additions like Microsoft Personal Shopping Assistant and Tampermonkey. But it remains an odd duck. It performs just as well as Chrome or Opera when loading a new webpage, and it’s nearly at the top of the class when browsing with just a few tabs. But under load, running 20 tabs, it slows down and bloats considerably.</p>\n<p>My benchmark tests show that Edge can simultaneously excel at calculating JavaScript operations used by websites, but supply just half of the responsiveness of Chrome in certain web apps. In short, Edge meets everyone’s expectations—good or bad.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0080-0153/170845-1-eng-GB/f0080-012.jpg\" width=\"731\" height=\"460\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0080-01\" title=\"f0080-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>Edge still consumes</b> more of your computer’s resources than other browsers when using a large number of tabs.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div>\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0081-0158/170838-1-eng-GB/f0081-012.jpg\" width=\"653\" height=\"688\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0081-01\" title=\"f0081-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>Edge’s performance is</b> all over the place in our list of benchmarks, which measure browser performance across a variety of Web-based tasks.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>Cortana gets her Groove on</b></h3><p>Cortana’s interactions have expanded from voice controls to the lock screen. Now, the Cortana full-screen experience launches any time she’s idle. Because Cortana normally hides in a narrow window in the corner of your screen, the full-screen experience is actually superior when displaying weather forecasts and maps.</p>\n<p>This time around, Cortana’s new features focus on music. If you ask her to play, say, “Paint It Black” by The Rolling Stones, she’ll launch Groove Music (if you have a subscription). Previously, she’d import a YouTube video.</p>\n<p>She’ll also launch music from TuneIn and iHeartRadio, if those apps are installed. Here, though, you’re subject to the whims of the apps; saying “play blues on iHeartRadio” prompted the app to play The Imaginary 8 The Girl’s One Woman Blues Band, which ain’t blues at all. You can also ask Cortana to identify what’s playing—quite handy if you’re listening to TuneIn, which simply streams local radio without any metadata.</p>\n<p>Cortana will also help you keep your commitments. If you’ve allowed her to read your Office 365 documents, don’t be surprised to see her reminding you to live up to promises you’ve previously made.</p>\n<p>Incidentally, Microsoft and Dolby have promised a Dolby Atmos app (with in-app purchases) that Dolby confirmed isn’t live yet.

It helped eliminate my wind-down period before I hit the hay.</p>\n<p>• Ads for features like OneDrive and Tips in Windows Explorer will drive some people absolutely crazy. Remember, though, that there are millions of users for whom the new features will require some hand-holding.</p>\n<p>• If you love macros and shortcuts, you’re in luck: New touchpad settings allow you to craft your own gestures.</p>\n<p>• PowerShell, a powerful yet slightly intimidating command interface (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/howtopowershell\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/howtopowershell</a>), is now built into File Explorer.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0083-0212/170817-1-eng-GB/f0083-022.jpg\" width=\"286\" height=\"314\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0083-02\" title=\"f0083-02\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>The Night Light</b> mode shifts your screen’s output toward orange or red so your body’s circadian rhythms aren’t interrupted by the blue light your monitor normally puts out.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>• For those who need it, Windows’ Narrator assistive technologies have significantly improved, with Braille support, a better Scan Mode, and assistance in resetting a PC.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0084-0163/170810-1-eng-GB/f0084-012.jpg\" width=\"591\" height=\"412\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0084-01\" title=\"f0084-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>If you have</b> a precision touchpad (the Home &gt; Devices &gt;Touchpad setting will tell you) you’ll be able to configure your own touch gestures. <b>84</b></p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>Keep exploring and you could find even more obscure but useful features, as we did, some of which just might become your favorites.</p>\n<h3><b>Creators Update succeeds in spite of itself</b></h3><p>I can’t say for certain how stable the Creators Update will be, though I noticed far fewer bugs than in preceding iterations. Microsoft Word had an issue with opening a file stored on OneDrive, and the helpful Tips app still referred to Anniversary Update content in my Creators Update build.</p>\n<p>What angers me, though, is how far removed the Creators Update is from the vision Microsoft presented in the fall, especially when it comes to 3D content. “If we truly want to make 3D for everyone, then we need to make 3D creation as simple as taking a photo or a video on your phone,” Microsoft’s Megan Saunders promised us then.</p>\n<p>It’s not. It’s not even close to that. There are so many features that Microsoft pledged and has yet to deliver on: apps to capture objects as 3D images, the My People experience, 3D objects in Office apps, mixed-reality devices from its partners. Windows Holographic, renamed Windows Mixed Reality, is present, Microsoft says, though available only to developers.</p>\n<p>I’ve chosen to focus on what’s actually shipping within the Creators Update, and the vast, diverse number of new features justifies our rating. We’re eager to try the Creators Update on the hardware seemingly handcrafted for it, like the Surface Studio (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/unboxstudio\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/unboxstudio</a>), and mixed reality devices.</p>\n<p>If Microsoft had nailed 3D content in the Creators Update, our rating would have been higher. I can’t help but think that Microsoft should have announced two Creators Updates: one now, and one scheduled for the fall.</p>\n<p>Is the Creators Update worth your time? Yes, absolutely. Microsoft’s creative vision enumerated inside the Creators Update remains potent and viable—though also unfulfilled.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0085-0162/170803-1-eng-GB/f0085-012.jpg\" width=\"590\" height=\"437\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0085-01\" title=\"f0085-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>Movies &amp; TV</b> now has a mini-player that hovers over other applications.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>Microsoft Windows 10 Creators Update</b></h3><p><b>AT A GLANCE</b></p>\n<p>Microsoft’s Windows 10 Creators Update doesn’t quite live up to Microsoft’s promises.

The reality’s a bit more complicated, but there’s still a lot to be excited about—especially if you’re trying to game on a modestly appointed PC rather than a powerhouse.</p>\n<p>Let’s not get ahead of ourselves though. Windows 10 never explicitly calls Game Mode to your attention. So what—and where—is it?</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0087-0157/171042-1-eng-GB/f0087-012.jpg\" width=\"873\" height=\"486\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0087-01\" title=\"f0087-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>The option to</b> activate Game Mode is at the top of the Game Bar’s settings.</p>\n <span class=\"credit\">\nIMAGE: BRAD CHACOS/IDG</span></figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>Meet Game Mode</b></h3><p>Game Mode is designed to improve the performance of your PC games, both raw frame-rate speeds and overall smoothness (which Microsoft calls consistency). It does so by dedicating a big chunk of your system’s resources to the game you’re playing, which prevents background processes from muscling in and potentially disrupting your experience. (Adios, unexpected antivirus scans!) Game Mode grants games more GPU cycles and a set number of CPU threads, though the exact details vary depending on your system configuration.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, Game Mode can work with <i>all</i> games, not just Windows Store games. Unfortunately it’s not immediately clear how to enable Game Mode manually, as the new Creators Update feature is hidden in a particularly dark corner of the Game Bar. Microsoft says some whitelisted games will enable Game Mode automatically, but we’ve yet to see that happen, even with Microsoft-published Windows Store games like <i>Gears of War 4</i> and <i>Forza Horizon 3</i>.</p>\n<p>To activate Game Mode, open your game, then press Win-G to bring up the Windows 10 Game Bar. Click the Settings cog on the right side of the bar to bring up a bunch of options. Check the box next to Use Game Mode For This Game near the top. Once you’ve done so, simply close the dialog box and Game Bar to get going. There’s no need to restart your game for Game Mode to take effect, though you do need to manually enable the feature for each and every game you want to use it with.</p>\n<p>use it with. But how does it <i>feel</i>? That’s where things get interesting.</p>\n<h3><b>Testing Windows 10’s Game Mode</b></h3><p>Microsoft downplayed the feature’s effect on raw frame rates when it revealed how Game Mode works (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/10gamemode\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/10gamemode</a>), telling reviewers to expect a 2- to 5-percent performance increase. This is a shifting of Windows resources, not a miracle. Early Game Mode testing by <i>PC Gamer,</i> PCGamesN, and Laptop Mag on gaming-focused systems saw little to no performance increase. Heck, <i>PC Gamer</i> saw a sizable performance decrease in Hitman with Game Mode enabled.</p>\n<p>If you’re running a relatively modern gaming rig with a desktop-caliber graphics card, don’t expect much out of Game Mode. But what if you’re not?</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0088-0159/171035-1-eng-GB/f0088-012.jpg\" width=\"558\" height=\"469\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0088-01\" title=\"f0088-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>Microsoft’s high-end Surface</b> Book.</p>\n <span class=\"credit\">\nIMAGE: GORDON MAH UNG</span></figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>Microsoft’s claims of improved performance <i>consistency</i> intrigued me. Dedicating a set amount of system resources to games might not do much in a rig brimming with powerful hardware, but it could make a world of difference in a more resource-constrained PC, like a laptop or a budget gaming machine. So that’s what I’m testing here.</p>\n<p>Microsoft provided <i>PCWorld</i> with the Creators Update early, installing it on our office Surface Book (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com</a>/ sbooki7rv). It’s no modest laptop: Our top-of-the- line version packs a 1TB SSD and 16GB of RAM, as well as a Core i7 CPU and discrete Nvidia graphics. Still, those Nvidia graphics are a humble GTX 965M with 2GB of on-board RAM, and the processor’s limited to two physical cores. So while the Surface Book’s a damned fine portable PC, it’s modest by gaming PC standards.</p>\n<p>Windows Store games built as universal Windows apps stand to gain more from Game Mode than traditional games, Microsoft says, because they don’t spawn additional processes. So we tested <i>Gears of War 4</i>, a DirectX 12 game built as a universal Windows app, alongside the DX11 version of <i>Rise of the Tomb Raider</i> on Steam. We also tested the older <i>Bioshock Infinite</i> with the discrete Nvidia GPU disabled, just to see how Game Mode handles integrated graphics.</p>\n<p>Each title was run using in-game benchmarks, with medium graphics enabled at 1280x800 resolution. That allowed all three to clear a playable 30-frames-per-second average. We tested each game four different ways.</p>\n<p>First, each benchmark was run with nothing extra running in the background except Nvidia’s GeForce Experience software.</p>\n<p>As you can see, Game Mode made almost no difference in the trio of games we tested. If you don’t have any programs running in the background competing for precious CPU threads, Game Mode offers practically no value.</p>\n<h3><b>No Background Tasks Enabled</b></h3>\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0089-0156/171028-1-eng-GB/f0089-012.jpg\" width=\"680\" height=\"342\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0089-01\" title=\"f0089-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>Background Tasks Enabled</b></h3>\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0090-0161/171021-1-eng-GB/f0090-012.jpg\" width=\"680\" height=\"341\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0090-01\" title=\"f0090-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>After that, it was time to muddy the waters with background processes. We opened an auto-playing YouTube playlist in Edge, started cranking tunes in Spotify, and activated AVG’s antivirus software—a reasonable simulation of what real-world gamers might run while playing—then retested each game with Game Mode both on and off.</p>\n<p><i>Bioshock</i> and <i>Tomb Raider</i> each saw a scant average increase of 1 fps or so—nothing your eye would detect in real life. But boy, is <i>Gears of War 4</i> interesting. First of all, its performance absolutely <i>plummeted</i> with the background processes active, by roughly 50 percent overall. That’s wild. But Game Mode proves truly useful in that reduced state, increasing the average frame rate by slightly more than 6 fps. That might not sound like much, but when you’re hovering around 30 fps total, that’s an increase of nearly 22 percent. It’s also enough to push <i>Gears</i> solidly past the 30 fps level, which many PC gamers consider the minimum acceptable frame rate. Fascinating!</p>\n<p>But it’s not as fascinating as what Game Mode did to <i>minimum</i> frame rates when background tasks were demanding system resources. First, let’s take a look at the minimum frame rates with no background tasks running, for reference. (<i>Bioshock Infinite</i> and <i>Rise of</i><i>the Tomb Raider</i>’s numbers represent the absolute lowest frame rate reached during the benchmark, while <i>Gears 4</i> uses the average of the bottom 5 percent of frames.)</p>\n<h3><b>No Background Tasks Enabled</b></h3>\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0091-0155/171014-1-eng-GB/f0091-012.jpg\" width=\"680\" height=\"341\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0091-01\" title=\"f0091-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>Yawn. As with the average frame rate, there’s virtually no difference. Game Mode doesn’t make a difference if you aren’t clogging up your computer with multiple programs.</p>\n<p>But if you are, Game Mode can have <i>significant</i> impact—enough to mean the difference between a playable and unplayable experience, subjectively. Here are the minimum frame rates for the trio of tested games when background processes are running in the background.</p>\n<h3><b>Background Tasks Enabled</b></h3>\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0091-0222/171007-1-eng-GB/f0091-022.jpg\" width=\"680\" height=\"342\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0091-02\" title=\"f0091-02\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>Running the trio of background tasks <i>devastates</i> the minimum frame rate in these games. <i>Gears</i> once again stumbles over itself, with the minimum falling from nearly 50 fps all the way down to 12.5 fps with Game Mode disabled. It’s a nasty 12.5 fps, too, with near-constant stuttering and severe stretches of paused action. <i>Bioshock</i> and <i>Tomb Raider</i>’s minimum frame rates each fell by roughly two-thirds, to under 10 fps. While <i>Bioshock</i>’s results look worse on paper, <i>Tomb Raider</i> actually performed far worse subjectively, plagued by the same colossal lag and stuttering as <i>Gears</i>, with an added bonus of significantly longer load times between benchmarking sections.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0092-0157/171000-1-eng-GB/f0092-012.jpg\" width=\"873\" height=\"579\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0092-01\" title=\"f0092-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>What it’s like</b> running these games without Game Mode enabled.</p>\n <span class=\"credit\">\nIMAGE: BEN WATTS</span></figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>Setting aside the benchmarks and playing the actual games, <i>Bioshock</i> could be suffered through. <i>Gears</i> and <i>Rise of the Tomb Raider</i> weren’t playable whatsoever. Turning on even that small handful of common background tasks while trying to game on this $3,200 laptop was an unmitigated disaster</p>\n<p>But Game Mode mitigated it—just enough.</p>\n<p>I won’t go so far as to say that playing <i>Gears 4</i> and <i>Rise of the Tomb Raider</i> with background tasks and Game Mode running was pleasant. Game Mode eliminated the long pauses and smoothed out the stuttering just enough to make the games playable, with an experience roughly comparable to running a graphically intense, cutting-edge game on the original Xbox One. Frame rates hovered around 30 fps in all games, with occasional dips and brief stuttering.</p>\n<p>While the minimum frame rate still sucked in <i>Bioshock</i> and <i>Tomb Raider</i>, it doubled with Game Mode activated. Gamers obsessed with hitting 60 fps wouldn’t be satisfied with the experience, but ones trying to run games on modest hardware should definitely check out Game Mode.</p>\n<h3><b>No magic bullet, unless it is</b></h3><p>This brief testing is far from comprehensive, but it shows that Game Mode isn’t quite as superfluous as early reports indicated. If you’re playing on a humble desktop or laptop with limited hardware, Windows 10’s Game Mode could make unplayable games playable enough (though in a case like this one, you’d be better off simply closing those background tasks). I suspect the effect would be more pronounced on laptops more modest than this swanky Core i7-equipped Surface Book.</p>\n<p class=\"pullQuote\">If you’re playing on a humble desktop or laptop with limited hardware, Windows 10’s Game Mode could make unplayable games playable enough.</p>\n<p>Dedicated gamers with beefy PCs are likely to see less benefit, as previous testing showed, though I’d wager there are edge cases where Game Mode could make a bigger difference. Extremely CPU-bound games such as Fallout 4 might see an uptick if you’re the kind of person who keeps other programs open while you play, as could games played on ultrafast 144Hz monitors, which can absolutely <i>hammer</i> pro-cessors. I also wouldn’t be surprised if Game Mode provided less bene-fit on Ryzen processors, because AMD’s chips are loaded with cores and threads. More testing is needed!</p>\n<p>Finally, it’s worth keeping in mind that Game Mode essentially blocks resources from any tasks running in the background, which can noticeably affect their performance. Enabling it reduced stuttering in the trio of games tested here, but introduced stuttering to the YouTube video playing in the background. You should avoid Game Mode at all costs if you’re running OBS or other software to stream your game, and if you’ve got a productivity task churning away in the background while you blow off some steam on Steam, expect it to take longer than normal.</p>\n","layout":{},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":1,"link_source":"","competition":[],"flatplan_title":"","notes":"","gutter_credit":"","other":"","image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1494015033.4862","name":"f0086-01","source":"IMAGE:

</div><p>DESPITE A REVAMP late last year, the dust hasn’t settled around HP’s 13.3-inch Spectre x360 just yet. A modest spring update of our favorite convertible gives it perks that first appeared in its revamped 15-inch sibling.</p>\n<p>Yep, that’s right. If you bought a Spectre x360 even a month ago, you may be slightly aggravated to learn that HP now ships it with active pen support. (A pen even comes in the box as an included accessory.) A 4K UHD option for the screen is available, too. With these additions, the x360 now has every major feature you could want from an ultraportable.</p>\n<p>The only thing keeping the Spectre x360 from rising even further above its peers is the small price you pay for these upgrades—partially in cold, hard cash, partially in performance. But even without changing its position in the pack, this notebook is still the convertible to beat.</p>\n<h3><b>A quick recap</b></h3><p>Since there’s so much overlap between the Fall 2016 and Spring 2017 models of the Spectre x360 (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/hpspectrex360\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/hpspectrex360</a>), let’s start with an overview of its standout points. (I’ll leave the fuller overview of shared attributes to our previous Spectre x360 review, <a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com</a>/ spectrex360rv.)</p>\n<p>First off, it weighs less than three pounds and fits easily inside a bag. It also has a flexible form factor, easily transforming between tablet, traditional clamshell, and other modes.</p>\n<p>Inside, it packs the fastest processor allowed in this class of laptop—a 7th-generation Intel Core i7 dual-core CPU—with an equally blistering fast PCIe-NVMe storage drive to go with it. On the outside, you get a comfortable keyboard, a pleasant trackpad, and even a set of worthwhile speakers. The Spectre x360 also has a well-placed integrated IR camera that supports Windows Hello and avoids a constant view of your throat in every video chat. And of course, you get a beautifully crisp IPS panel with 10-point touch.</p>\n<p>Oh, and it costs less than most other thin-and-light laptops with similar configurations. (More on that later.)</p>\n<p>That said, there are a couple of changes to note. The 2017 Spectre x360 no longer comes with a USB-C to Gigabit ethernet adapter—instead, you get a pen accessory as your freebie. (You do still get a free sleeve, though.) It also seems to cost a little bit more. Our previous Kaby Lake review unit cost $1,300, but if you configure a system on <a href=\"http://HP.com\" target=\"_self\">HP.com</a> with the exact same specs, it’s now $1,350.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0097-0141/171148-1-eng-GB/f0097-012.jpg\" width=\"873\" height=\"538\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0097-01\" title=\"f0097-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>The Fall 2016</b> (right) and Spring 2017 Spectre x360 (left) are virtually the same, save for a few additional features in the 2017 model.</p>\n <span class=\"credit\">\nIMAGE: ALAINA YEE/IDG</span></figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>Performance</b></h3><p>The specs of our current $1,600 review unit largely mirror that of the previous Spectre x360 that we reviewed: a Kaby Lake Intel Core i7-7500U processor, 16GB of LPDDR3/1866 RAM, a 512GB Samsung PM961 PCI-NVMe SSD, Thunderbolt 3, and a Windows Hello–compatible camera. What sets it apart is that 4K IPS touchscreen with active pen support.</p>\n<p>I’m going to jump straight to what I assume everyone wants to know first: What it’s like to use the pen and the 4K touchscreen.</p>\n<p>As a disclaimer, I’m no artist (as you can see by my penmanship alone), so I’m unable to comment in depth on how well the Spectre handles sensitivity when doing inking, shading, and the like. But I can say that the Spectre x360 works well for taking notes and sketching out rough diagrams. It feels natural, and the results look crisp. Palm rejection did fail me on occasion, but I could tie it to hesitant placement of my hand on the screen.</p>\n<p>As for the 4K display, it’s gorgeous. So many pixels on a 13.3-inch screen may seem like overkill, but it’s hard not to like all the detail you can see in photos and 4K video if you work with (or view) them often. Overall, the panel is crisp and fairly bright, with a max output of 340 nits.</p>\n<p>Of course, with a 4K display comes a performance trade-off. Surprisingly, the Spectre x360 showed dips in areas beyond what we expected, though those did little to affect the overall day-to-day experience.</p>\n<h3><b>Battery life</b></h3><p>First, the facts. A 4K touchscreen drains a lot more battery than a full-HD touchscreen. More pixels require more juice.</p>\n<p>For our video rundown test, we first charge a laptop to 100 percent, then set its screen between 250 and 260 nits to simulate the brightness level you’d use in an office. With a pair of earbuds plugged in and the volume set to 50 percent, we run a 4K video file (the open-source Tears of Steel) on continuous loop in Windows 10’s Movies &amp; TV app until the laptop shuts itself off.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0098-0140/171141-1-eng-GB/f0098-012.jpg\" width=\"873\" height=\"546\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0098-01\" title=\"f0098-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>Don’t blame the</b> Spectre x360 for my terrible penmanship.

You get almost four hours more with the lower-resolution model—that’s half a workday or a couple of classes right there.</p>\n<p>The actual runtime, however, isn’t bad by any means: Seven hours is almost a full workday, and it’s definitely longer than a direct cross-country flight. For people who want to live in a 4K world, the sacrifice is one that can be easily lived with.</p>\n<h3><b>PCMark 8</b></h3><p>We use PCMark 8’s Work Conventional benchmark to measure performance during the kind of everyday tasks we office drudges do most often—this test simulates activities like web browsing, video chatting, and document editing. The load on a system isn’t particularly heavy, and because this 4K version of the Spectre has the same processor, RAM, and type of storage as our 2016 review unit, we were expecting the benchmark results to be similar.</p>\n<p>This is where the weirdness popped up. Performance dropped by 18.7 percent—a gap that’s startlingly large, and definitely outside a margin of error. So we ran the test again with the notebook’s resolution set to 1920x1080. That brought us within the expected range, but it’s not an expected result. These days, PCMark 8’s scores haven’t been overly affected by differences in resolution, so there may be a driver issue in play.</p>\n<p>That said, this difference won’t really affect the experience of using a 4K Spectre x360 for writing email or updating a spreadsheet. Any score over 2,000 in Work Conventional means a system will feel responsive during low-intensity tasks.</p>\n<h3><b>PCMark 8 Work Conventional</b></h3>\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0100-0146/171127-1-eng-GB/f0100-012.jpg\" width=\"680\" height=\"606\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0100-01\" title=\"f0100-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>3DMark Sky Diver Overall</b></h3>\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0101-0138/171120-1-eng-GB/f0101-012.jpg\" width=\"680\" height=\"606\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0101-01\" title=\"f0101-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>3DMark Sky Diver</b></h3><p>We ran into a similar story when we fired up 3DMark’s synthetic graphics benchmark. When we loaded Sky Diver to see how the GPU would handle itself, we again saw a gap in performance between the 4K Spectre x360 and other Kaby Lake processors with the same integrated graphics core.</p>\n<p>Here, the performance delta isn’t quite as dramatic as with PCMark 8, but you can still see about a 9 percent decline when compared to the 2016 Spectre x360. When we dropped the resolution to 1920x1080, that disappeared.</p>\n<p>In practice, it’s not a matter of concern. Any gaming you’d do on this ultraportable laptop is already limited to less taxing games like League of Legends and Minecraft, and you’d be playing them at lower resolutions and lower image quality to boot.</p>\n<h3><b>Handbrake 0.9.9</b></h3><p>Switching over to tests that focus solely on CPU performance paints a more expected picture. When we ran our Handbrake encoding test, which involves transcoding a 30GB MKV file into a smaller MP4 file using the Android Tablet preset, the 4K Spectre x360 held steady with the 2016 model.</p>\n<p>On these thin-and-light notebooks, Handbrake is a torture test. We use it to hammer on the CPU and see what happens next: Will the notebook start blasting its fans? Will it instead begin throttling performance to keep it cooler? If a system does lower the CPU’s clock speed, it’ll of course complete the encode at a slower rate.</p>\n<h3><b>Handbrake Encode 0.9.9 (sec)</b></h3>\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0102-0140/171113-1-eng-GB/f0102-012.jpg\" width=\"680\" height=\"556\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0102-01\" title=\"f0102-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>Cinebench R15 (Single Thread)</b></h3>\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0103-0136/171106-1-eng-GB/f0103-012.jpg\" width=\"680\" height=\"556\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0103-01\" title=\"f0103-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>For the Spectre x360, HP favors keeping the system cool. That allows the Dell XPS 13 and its slightly less powerful Core i5-7200U processor to dominate—Dell opts to run its laptop’s fans harder instead of lowering the processor’s speed, and the traditional clamshell design means the system can run a little warmer, too. The Spectre, on the other hand, is a convertible, and nobody wants to hang onto a scorching-hot tablet. Accordingly, HP cranks down the speed on the Core i7-7500U a little as the processor heats up. During the encode, we saw clock speeds fluctuate between 2.6GHz and 2.7GHz.</p>\n<h3><b>Cinebench R15 single-threaded performance</b></h3><p>For our final full benchmark, we pulled out Maxon’s Cinebench rendering test. Like Handbrake, it focuses solely on CPU performance, but its shorter run of just a few minutes helps demonstrate how a system would handle short bursts of activity.</p>\n<p>When set to test just a single CPU thread, Cinebench gives an idea of how well a laptop would do when running a load that doesn’t tax all of the CPU cores. That covers most tasks that people run on their PC, especially a convertible like the Spectre.</p>\n<p>Again, no major differences here between the 4K Spectre and its 2016 FHD counterpart. It still sits close to the top of the chart, too.</p>\n<p class=\"pullQuote\">Again, no major differences here between the 4K Spectre and its 2016 FHD counterpart.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0104-0148/171099-1-eng-GB/f0104-012.jpg\" width=\"873\" height=\"586\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0104-01\" title=\"f0104-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n <span class=\"credit\">\nIMAGE: ALAINA YEE</span></figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div>\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0105-0140/171092-1-eng-GB/f0105-012.jpg\" width=\"590\" height=\"467\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0105-01\" title=\"f0105-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n <span class=\"credit\">\nIMAGE: HP</span></figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>Storage speed</b></h3><p>One change we did notice between our 2016 Spectre x360 and this 2017 4K model is the type of SSD inside. Our 2016 review unit came equipped with a Samsung PM951 NVMe M.2 drive, which posted speeds of 1.7GBps for sequential read and 581MBps for sequential write in Crystal Disk Mark 5.02.</p>\n<p>This 2017 4K Spectre sports a Samsung PM961 NVMe M.2 drive, which offers a definite upgrade in sequential write speed. In Crystal Disk Mark 5.02, we got 1.5GBps read and 1.4GBps write for sequential loads. (And in case you’re interested, the same drive blazed along at 3.2GBps read and 1.5GBps write for sequential Q32T1 loads.)</p>\n<h3><b>Conclusion</b></h3><p>We’re still on the fence about whether the Spectre x360 is the best ultrabook laptop, but it undoubtedly still crushes the other convertibles out there. HP has thoughtfully curated bleeding-edge technology into a single machine that has tremendous value.</p>\n<p>Just look at the math. If you want a convertible, you can opt for Lenovo’s Yoga 910, which actually gets you slightly better specs but no active pen support. A Core i7-7500U system with 16GB DDR4/2133 RAM, 512GB PCIe SSD, 13.9-inch 4K UHD IPS touchscreen, and fingerprint reader costs $1,500. That’s cheaper, but keep in mind the Yoga 910 is also a larger and heavier notebook.</p>\n<p>If you want a compact convertible with active pen support, there’s Dell’s XPS 13 2-in-1, but you’ll forgo a 4K screen and some performance. The XPS 13 2-in-1 comes equipped with a low-power Core i7-7Y75 processor, 16GB LPDDR3/1866 RAM, a 512GB PCIe SSD, QHD+ (3200x1800) touchscreen, and a fingerprint reader. If you want a pen, it costs an additional $50. Total: $1,850.</p>\n<p>Pitting the Spectre x360 against our current ultrabook champion, the Dell XPS 13, you’ll pay $1900 for a Core i7-7500U CPU, 16GB LPDDR3/1866 RAM, a 512GB PCIe SSD, and a QHD+ (3200x1800) touchscreen. You’ll also drop an additional $25 for a fingerprint reader if you want to use Windows Hello, and there is no active pen support nor option for an IR camera that enables Windows Hello facial recognition.</p>\n<p>Specs aren’t everything, of course. You might want longer battery life, or a more compact package, or more ports. But if we had to recommend one laptop to someone who didn’t want to think too much about their purchase and wanted the best of everything, this is absolutely still it.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n

We’ve run a battery of benchmarks to see if those cores will make up the difference.</p>\n<h3><b>Meet Ryzen 5</b></h3><p>AMD actually announced four Ryzen 5 CPUs last month. Two of them are quad-cores with SMT (simultaneous multithreading): The $169 Ryzen 5 1400 and the $189 Ryzen 5 1500X. The last two are six-core chips with SMT: The $219 Ryzen 5 1600 and the $249 Ryzen 5 1600X</p>\n<p>All are based on the same die used in the upscale Ryzen 7 lineup we’ve already reviewed, but they have cores switched off.</p>\n<p>The one of most interest to us is the Ryzen 5 1600X. With its list price of $249, it maps almost perfectly to the Core i5-7600K, which has a current list price of $242 and has sat around at $250 for much of its life.</p>\n<p>The six-core and quad-core Ryzen CPUs are essentially built using the same eight-core dies from Ryzen 7. Each features two Core Complex (CCX) units with CPU cores switched off. One core on each is switched off for the six-core Ryzen 5s, and two cores on each are turned off for the quad-core CPUs. They also have different clock speeds.</p>\n<h3><b>How we tested</b></h3><p>For the Core i5-7600K, testing was conducted using the same system we used for the Core i7-7700K in our Ryzen 7 review, but with a few key changes. We updated the Asus ROG Maximus IV Code to the latest available BIOS, which basically adds Optane support. We also pulled two of four memory modules we had installed. This reduced the RAM from 32GB to 16GB of DDR4, but it also allowed us to increase the memory clock of our Corsair modules from DDR4/2133 to DDR4/2933 speeds.</p>\n<p>Note that running Kaby Lake at higher speeds with all memory slots full isn’t an issue. Not all of the CPUs we tested (*cough* Ryzen), however, will easily support high clock speeds with all DIMM slots loaded.</p>\n<h3><b>Ryzen 5 1600X and Core i5-7600K compared</b></h3>\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0109-0141/171303-1-eng-GB/f0109-012.jpg\" width=\"360\" height=\"212\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0109-01\" title=\"f0109-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div>\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0109-027/171296-1-eng-GB/f0109-022.jpg\" width=\"731\" height=\"319\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0109-02\" title=\"f0109-02\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>Each Zen core</b> complex is made up of four individual processors.

AMD provided the board, saying it had a newer BIOS that offered the best performance. A clean install of Windows 10 was loaded onto a Kingston 256GB HyperX SSD (the same model and capacity used in other test machines). For RAM, I used a pair of Geil EVO 8GB modules with the timing set to AMD’s specifications for testing on the Tomahawk board.</p>\n<p>As with all of our builds, we used Founders Edition GeForce GTX 1080 cards. I verified clock and RAM timings on each card before I began testing.</p>\n<h3><b>First up: Productivity benchmarks</b></h3><p>Our benchmarking begins with a battery of productivity tests. First, Cinebench for multithreaded performance, then Blender and POV-Ray for image-rendering chops. We add Handbrake and Adobe Premiere CC 2017 for video encoding.</p>\n<h3><b>Cinebench Performance</b></h3><p>Our first test is the ever-reliable Cinebench R15, which is made by Maxon and based off a real rendering engine used in its Cinema4D parts. You might recall that this benchmark was fingered by the FTC over alleged Intel benchmark improprieties, but Maxon has claimed its innocence.</p>\n<h3><b>Cinebench R15.038 Single-Threaded Performance</b></h3>\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0110-0138/171289-1-eng-GB/f0110-012.jpg\" width=\"591\" height=\"268\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0110-01\" title=\"f0110-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>Running Cinebench R15.038</b> restricted to a single thread, the higher clock speeds and better instructions per clock of Kaby Lake give it a slight advantage over Ryzen.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>CineBench R15.038 Multi-Threaded Performance</b></h3>\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0111-0137/171282-1-eng-GB/f0111-012.jpg\" width=\"591\" height=\"268\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0111-01\" title=\"f0111-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>When tapping all</b> cores, Cinebench R15.038 shows you the performance advantage Ryzen 5 1600X, with its six cores and SMT, has over the four-core Core i5-7600K.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>The first result you see is Cinebench R15 restricted to a single thread.

For the most part, the Core i5-7600K sits at 4.2GHz at almost all loads all the time. The Ryzen 5 1600X bounces around, hitting 4.1GHz clock speeds only on occasion. You’re looking at maybe a 12-percent difference, which ain’t bad, but in the end, still second-best.</p>\n<p>We retested on Cinebench R15, but this time with all the CPU cores and threads available. You’re seeing roughly an 80-percent difference in performance when all cores are hot on Ryzen 5 and the Core i5. Let’s say that again: An 80-percent difference. That’s just a crushing blow to Core i5 and pretty much frames how this battle is likely to shape up: Give up a little single-threaded performance for a huge bump in multi-threaded performance.</p>\n<h3><b>Blender 2.78 BMW (sec)</b></h3>\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0111-023/171275-1-eng-GB/f0111-022.jpg\" width=\"591\" height=\"242\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0111-02\" title=\"f0111-02\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>The open-source Blender</b> 3D rendering application shows you how much faster Ryzen 5 is with 12 threads vs. the Core i5-7600K’s 4 threads.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>Blender Performance</b></h3><p>Blender is a popular open-source 3D renderer that’s used in a lot of indie movie productions.

The winner by a country mile is Ryzen 5 1600X</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>POV Ray performance</b></h3><p>Our last rendering test uses a professional application called Persistence of Vision Raytracer, or POV Ray. It actually hearkens back to the days of the Amiga. Its built-in benchmark spits out a score that tells you how many pixels per second are rendered by a CPU.</p>\n<p>First, single-threaded performance, which looks an awful lot like Cinebench R15’s single-threaded results. The Kaby Lake Core i5 has the advantage. Haters, say what you will, but those 7th-gen chips are mean little CPUs.</p>\n<p>With POV-Ray, like all professional applications, the number of cores and threads available boost performance. The multithreaded results say it all: The Ryzen 5 is pushing out almost 50 percent more pixels per second during its render job. It’s another crushing blow to Core i5, showing you the weakness of a straight quad-core chip with no Hyper-Threading.</p>\n<h3><b>7-Zip Performance</b></h3><p>If you’re like us, you immediately uninstalled the annoying brand-name Zip program on your PC and pointed your browser at the free and fast 7-Zip. The free app features a built-in benchmark that measures the speed of a machine at compressing and decompressing files. Ryzen 5 picks up Core i5, throws it into the audience, then jumps out of the ring to smash a break-away chair over its quad-core head.</p>\n<h3><b>Geekbench 4.1</b></h3><p>I haven’t always used Geekbench in CPU reviews, as the test has been somewhat controversial in the past. The latest version still takes algorithms its creator (Primate Labs) thinks are relevant in image editing, encryption and the like, and measures how well a CPU can run them. Primate Labs has changed how the test looks at CPU performance, however, and most consider that to be an improvement.</p>\n<p>The latest version specifically addresses Ryzen performance, so I was interested to see the results. Ryzen 5 outpaces Core i5, but even though this is a multi-threaded test, I’m not seeing the scaling result I expected. That means either the test’s algorithms don’t particular favor Ryzen, or it just doesn’t scale with the core and thread counts that well. I’m inclined to believe the latter, as the difference between a Core i5 and Core i7 (which adds Hyper-Threading) is maybe 10 percent.</p>\n<h3><b>Geekbench 4.1 Single-Threaded Score</b></h3>\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0114-0140/171247-1-eng-GB/f0114-012.jpg\" width=\"591\" height=\"242\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0114-01\" title=\"f0114-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>Geekbench 4.10 has</b> been updated to better support Ryzen CPUs.

Handbrake loves, loves, loves CPU cores, and it shows. Ryzen 5 smokes Core i5 by about 70 percent in encoding time. Again, 12 threads vs 4 threads is not even a contest.</p>\n<h3><b>Adobe Premiere Pro Creative Cloud 2017</b></h3><p>For a video test, we took an actual published project from our video colleagues at <a href=\"http://IDG.tv\" target=\"_self\">IDG.tv</a> that was shot on a 4K Sony camera, and we tasked both machines to encode it using the Blu-ray preset in Premiere Pro CC 2017. Premiere Pro lets you encode using the GPU, which tends to offer a huge performance decrease in render time, or the CPU, which is still generally considered to offer the best visual quality. Using the CPU for this first chart, you can see the Ryzen 5 flexing its core count over Core i5, offering a massive decrease in render times. If time is money, Ryzen 5 gets you more money.</p>\n<p>Realistically, however, many people will give up visual quality for the speed of a GPU render. Although the CPU matters a little less, we’re still seeing roughly a 40-percent bump in GPU rendering speed by using Ryzen 5 vs. a Core i5.</p>\n<h3><b>Why you don’t need to freak out</b></h3><p>If the last four charts are enough to freak you out, don’t. We know much more about Ryzen 5 then we did about Ryzen 7 when it launched, and the lack of answers seemed to swirl around for weeks.</p>\n<p>Although there are still some outstanding questions, it’s clear to me that there isn’t some flaw with Ryzen that makes it slow (which everyone feared). The most logical conclusion is to blame the games themselves.</p>\n<p>I say this because If Ashes of the Singularity developer Oxide can bump performance by 20 percent or more after a couple weeks’ worth of tweaking, and in fact says it’s not fair to even compare Intel with AMD with the previous code, it stands to reason other games could do the same. Optimization may not erase the difference completely, but it should make any remaining difference insignificant.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0118-0145/171198-1-eng-GB/f0118-012.jpg\" width=\"873\" height=\"553\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0118-01\" title=\"f0118-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n <span class=\"credit\">\nIMAGE: GORDON MAH UNG</span></figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>Ryzen may still have problems with older games if only because game developers are unlikely to update code for a 2014 title.

When it comes to deciding the matter at hand—which is the best $250 CPU— the complicated answer is: Match the workloads above with what you do and choose based on your needs, not what someone tells you is right.</p>\n<p>The problem is, people don’t want complicated answers. They want simple answers and they want you to pick for them. In that case, Ryzen 5 is the way to go. It burns Core i5 to the ground in multi-threaded applications performance and doesn’t give up much in single-threaded performance.</p>\n<p>On the thorny gaming question, Core i5 still has an advantage for now. We expect newer games will support Ryzen, making the performance difference mostly moot down the road.</p>\n<p>It’s pretty hard to pass up the incredible performance the Ryzen 5 1600X offers, especially as we move into a world where more cores and more threads are expected to matter. For that new world, the Ryzen 5 1600X is easily the winner and just a hell of a deal for the overall performance you get.</p>\n","layout":{},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":1,"link_source":"","competition":[],"flatplan_title":"","notes":"","gutter_credit":"","other":"","image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1494015064.942","name":"f0107-01","source":"IMAGE:

Many theories later (including one that has absolved Microsoft), the only one that seems to be standing are the games themselves.</p>\n<p>AMD’s numbers show that patching Ash<i>es of the Singularity: Escalation</i> with Ryzen optimization could increase performance 26 to 34 percent, a significant boost for Ryzen.</p>\n<p>Here’s your independent verification, too: AMD officials gave PCWorld early access to a beta that features the Ryzen optimizations, which we tested under our control.</p>\n<h3><b>How we tested</b></h3><p>For our original Ryzen review (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/ryzenrev\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/ryzenrev</a>), we tested using four DDR4/2133 modules, which is the maximum clock speed for RAM when the memory controller is fully loaded. Because AMD says Ryzen performance can be improved using higher-clocked memory, we stripped out two modules, bringing the system to 16GB, and upped the speed to DDR4/2933. We also updated the BIOS on our Asus Crosshair VI Hero motherboard to the latest publicly available. The same GeForce GTX 1080 GPU handled the graphics chores.</p>\n<p>The beta game executable was downloaded from Steam directly and not provided by AMD. Our Ryzen review actually used the original <i>Ashes of the Singularity</i>, but for this test, the beta required using the <i>Ashes of the Singularity: Escalation</i> expansion pack version.</p>\n<p>The result? AMD’s not fronting. Our own tests found that running <i>Ashes of the Singularity: Escalation</i> gave a 20- to 28-percent boost in our testing conditions.</p>\n<p>We also conducted CPU-centric testing, which puts more objects on the screen with more AI and physics to stress more cores. The bump wasn’t quite as significant, but there’s still a healthy increase in performance from just tweaking the game code.</p>\n<p>The good news is, you can test it too. A patched version of the game containing the Ryzen optimizations should be immediately available on Steam for you to download and test.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0122-0136/171360-1-eng-GB/f0122-012.jpg\" width=\"873\" height=\"738\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0122-01\" title=\"f0122-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>Ashes of the Singularity</b> was able to squeeze almost a third more performance out of Ryzen.</p>\n <span class=\"credit\">\nIMAGE: AMD/NEWEGG</span></figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>But what about Intel?</b></h3><p>Of course, you’re wondering how this optimization helps Ryzen compete with Intel’s chips, such as the Core i7-7700K. The patch helps, but it doesn’t make it as fast. In the first chart, for example, a stock-clocked Core i7-7700K would be pushing 92 frames per second. Some of that clearly comes from the Kaby Lake’s higher clock speed (which generally runs at 500MHz faster or more), but some of it also comes from games optimization.</p>\n<p>In fact, that’s why I featured the same Ryzen CPU in our charts. Developers tell <i>PCWorld</i> Ryzen tuning is still in its infancy, and it’s somewhat unfair to pit the two chips against other right now with the code as it is.</p>\n<p>“Every processor is different on how you tune it, and Ryzen gave us some new data points on optimization,” Oxide’s Dan Baker told PCWorld. “We’ve invested thousands of hours tuning Intel CPUs to get every last bit of performance out of them, but comparatively little time so far on Ryzen.”</p>\n<p>Baker said Oxide wanted to get the beta out to the world so users could at least see the potential. Oxide’s CEO also said (in a statement released by AMD), “as good as AMD Ryzen is right now—and it’s remarkably fast—we’ve already seen that we can tweak games like <i>Ashes of the Singularity</i> to take even more advantage of its impressive core count and processing power. AMD Ryzen brings resources to the table that will change what people will come to expect from a PC gaming experience.”</p>\n<p>Oxide isn’t the only one starting to tune for Ryzen.

\t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n <span class=\"credit\">\nIMAGE: ROCK BAND VR</span></figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>WELL, THE HALLOWED day has <i>finally</i> arrived. Assuming you’re willing to spend $600 on an Oculus Rift and its accompanying Touch controllers, then another $70-ish on a plastic guitar and a copy of the game, then you can finally—finally—play <i>Rock Band</i> on a PC.</p>\n<p>It’s really more like a Guitar Hero game of course, and lacking the huge DLC back catalog of its console counterparts, but still. <i>Rock Band</i>. On PC.</p>\n<p>Sort of.</p>\n<h3><b>All the world’s a stage</b></h3><p>I’ve been messing with Rock Band VR (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/rkbndvramz\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/rkbndvramz</a>) off-and-on for the last two days. The first thing I’ll say: Much as I hate the idea of rebuying my entire song library piecemeal, this game desperately needs DLC. It’s been a while since I’ve been limited to only the pack-in soundtrack on a <i>Rock Band</i> game, and oof, it’s rough.</p>\n<p>Not that the soundtrack here is bad. Quite the contrary. It’s basically a “Greatest Hits” collection from Harmonix’s <i>Guitar Hero</i> and <i>Rock Band</i> days. Dragonforce’s “Through the Fire and Flames” makes an appearance, as does Bon Jovi’s “Living on a Prayer,” The Killers’ “When You Were Young,” Pearl Jam’s “Alive,” David Bowie’s “Suffragette City,” and the list goes on. It’s about the safest soundtrack I could imagine, benefiting from moving to a new platform where, oh yeah, nobody owns any songs yet.</p>\n<p>But with 60 songs total, it does mean that the odd stinker really cuts into the number of tracks available to you. With <i>Rock Band 4</i> on my Xbox I have something like 500 songs to choose from between various disc imports and DLC. If I don’t like a song, I just never play it. Here, that’s not really an option.</p>\n<p>The good news is I plan to keep playing. Hell, as someone who owns both a Vive and Rift, I’d say <i>Rock Band VR</i> is the first game to give me a reason to actually leave my Rift set up, rather than wrapping up a 2-4 hour experience and then stashing it in a closet until the next Oculus exclusive.</p>\n<p>Oculus clearly thinks so too, packing in the <i>Rock Band VR</i> adapter with Touch purchases rather than making Harmonix distribute it. Dig out your Touch box and you’ll find a little oval of plastic, which affixes to the back of your <i>Rock Band</i> guitar. Both the Xbox One and PS4 guitars work, though you’ll need Windows 10 and the accompanying dongle for the former or a Bluetooth connection for the latter. The right-hand Touch controller then slots over the headstock and through the holder.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0127-0138/171431-1-eng-GB/f0127-012.jpg\" width=\"873\" height=\"488\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0127-01\" title=\"f0127-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n <span class=\"credit\">\nIMAGE: ROCK BAND VR</span></figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>It’s bizarre and causes some weight balance issues, making the guitar neck heavier than the rest, but once in-game the tracking works excellently. Twist the guitar, throw it up in the air, smash it on the ground, whatever—you’ll still get position-tracking.</p>\n<p>In fact I’d say <i>Rock Band VR</i> is the perfect program for Oculus Touch. My main complaint during our review was Oculus’s subpar tracking system, which had issues if you reached up high, reached down low, or (in two-sensor mode) turned around and occluded the controllers.</p>\n<p>With <i>Rock Band VR</i> your hands are always around waist level, and it’s a stage so 90 percent of the time you’re facing forward. And if you do turn around, you’ll still know where “Forward” is, which is equally important. <i>Rock Band VR</i> is Touch’s optimal use case.</p>\n<p>It’s not the <i>Rock Band</i> of old though. Not officially, anyway. <i>Rock Band VR</i> is more interested in simulating the feeling of being on stage, the “feeling” (loosely) of playing guitar for a crowd. As such, Harmonix ditched the iconic note highway and doubled down on the “Freestyle” tech it used for solos in <i>Rock Band 4</i>.</p>\n<p>Strum along to the beat and the guitar just plays things. What it plays is sort-of controlled by the player—different combinations of fingers produce arpeggios, power chords, muted power chords, single notes, and more. The game then loosely fits “What You Played” to the song itself, rendering out sections of “Through the Fire and Flames” as if they were played with arpeggios, power chords, muted power chords, and so on.</p>\n<p class=\"pullQuote\">Sometimes it sounds great. Sometimes it sounds terrible.</p>\n<p>Sometimes it sounds great. Sometimes it sounds terrible. I understand why Harmonix went to this system—it frees up the player’s eyes, allowing you to feel more like you’re putting on a concert. You can look down at the crowd, watch the drummer, hang out with the bassist, or whatever, all without worrying too much about what you’re playing. Compared to the desert-dry eyes I get whenever I <i>actually</i> play <i>Rock Band</i>, this iteration is downright relaxing.</p>\n<p>It’s a bit too relaxing though, at times. There is a scoring system built in, based around executing combos. Alternate between power chords and muted power chords for two bars for instance and you’ll score a bonus for the “Alternator” progression. There’s a surprising amount of depth to this system, and I’ve definitely improved the longer I’ve played.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0128-0133/171424-1-eng-GB/f0128-012.jpg\" width=\"802\" height=\"473\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0128-01\" title=\"f0128-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n <span class=\"credit\">\nIMAGE: HAYDEN DINGMAN</span></figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div>\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0129-0132/171417-1-eng-GB/f0129-012.jpg\" width=\"873\" height=\"490\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0129-01\" title=\"f0129-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n <span class=\"credit\">\nIMAGE: ROCK BAND VR</span></figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>Like <i>Rock Band 4</i>’s solos though, freestyle doesn’t feel near as satisfying as nailing a tough sequence of notes. The tech is impressive, and when you make a song sound unintentionally great with a weird power chord breakdown in the middle or whatever, well it tickles some creative musician part of your brain. In some ways it’s more like playing guitar than actual <i>Rock Band</i>.</p>\n<p>But in other ways, less. There just isn’t much asked of the player. Show up, play some stuff, relax. It’s a conscious decision, meant to allow the player freedom to focus their attention elsewhere. The problem is there’s not much to focus on, past your first song or two. The act of playing a song doesn’t change much, and there’s only so many times you can try and mess with the drummer before you’ve been-there-done-that. Even for those willing to give freestyle a shot, I think it’ll become a bit stale long before the note highway did/does.</p>\n<p>The one thing that’s kept me playing freestyle is the campaign. It’s not quite as involved as <i>Rock Band</i> 4’s “Behind the Music”-style expansion, but it takes the same tack: Trying to make you feel like you’re part of a real band. You’re treated to some backstage moments with your band members, some silly venue gimmicks, and it’s an overall lighthearted and fun take on what being in a rock band is like.</p>\n<p class=\"pullQuote\">In <i>Rock Band VR</i> it’s just you and a gigantic, oversized note highway.</p>\n<p>Though again, returning to the setlist issues: Whatever a show asks for, you play. And some of the sets are bizarre, like “Someone just stuck Carrie Underwood into the middle of these classic rock songs for no reason.”</p>\n<p>Luckily the note highway is still there to fall back on. Accessible from the main menu, “Classic Mode” just puts you in an empty void with the note highway stretching out before you. From there? It plays like <i>Rock Band</i>, same as ever. Or, you know, <i>Guitar Hero</i>.</p>\n<p>It plays like the best version of those games, in some ways. No more “Standing Slightly Off-Angle From The TV So You Can’t See Very Well.” No more “Someone Walked In Front Of You By Accident.” And no more “Your Instrument Occupies Only A Quarter Of This Very Crowded Screen.”</p>\n<p>None of that. In <i>Rock Band VR</i> it’s just you and a gigantic, oversized note highway. I’ve actually really enjoyed it, insofar as it’s just “Me playing a <i>Rock Band</i> guitar in an empty virtual room, in my empty actual room.”</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0130-0131/171410-1-eng-GB/f0130-012.jpg\" width=\"873\" height=\"473\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0130-01\" title=\"f0130-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n <span class=\"credit\">\nIMAGE: ROCK BAND VR</span></figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div>\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0131-0134/171403-1-eng-GB/f0131-012.jpg\" width=\"873\" height=\"490\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0131-01\" title=\"f0131-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>Part of me laments the fact Harmonix didn’t put together a full-band experience here, as it would be great to play with friends or strangers over the internet, with some sort of basic position tracking on all four. I think that’s the missing piece, the aspect that would really put <i>Rock Band VR</i> over the top and make it a must-have. As I’ve gotten older and it’s gotten harder to get friends together to play <i>Rock Band</i>, some sort of virtual solution would’ve been the best compromise.</p>\n<h3><b>Bottom line</b></h3><p>But as it is? It’s <i>Rock Band</i>, on a PC. Sort of. There are missteps—a few overlong tutorial sections, a “safe” soundtrack, and freestyle mode might not hold your attention for as long as Harmonix hopes.</p>\n<p>It’s an excellent use of Oculus’s tech though, both as a simulated stage experience and as a use-case for Touch that doesn’t constantly break. Freestyle lacks complexity, sure, but it nails that “Being a rock star” feel for a few songs. And when you’re done? Classic Mode’s there to fall back on.</p>\n<p>Rock Band VR’s not exactly a must-have, but it’s up there–at least for people who haven’t burned out on the plastic instrument genre. Me? As long as Harmonix keeps supporting it with DLC I’ll probably keep checking back in, snagging a few songs, and putting on a show.</p>\n<h3><b>Rock Band VR</b></h3><p><b>AT A GLANCE</b></p>\n<p>Rock Band VR brings the rhythm series to PC (finally), drops you in the rhinestone boots of your favorite guitarists, and puts the Oculus Touch controllers to a weird— but perfect—use.</p>\n<p><b>PROS</b></p>\n<p>• In its best moments it makes you feel like you’re actually on-stage</p>\n<p>• No issues with Oculus’s tracking or the Touch controllers (for once!)</p>\n<p>• Soundtrack made up of greatest hits from rhythm games past</p>\n<p><b>CONS</b></p>\n<p>• Attaching Touch to the Rock Band guitar causes weight and balance issues</p>\n<p>• Soundtrack desperately needs fleshing out</p>\n<p>• Freestyle isn’t as satisfying as nailing a complex set of notes in actual Rock Band</p>\n<p>$70</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n

almost a year, but I’ve ignored it because my beat doesn’t include mobile devices. That changed about a month ago when Logitech integrated Amazon’s Alexa Voice Service into its ZeroTouch app. Now I can use voice commands to control my smart home while I’m in the car and my smartphone is connected to the ZeroTouch (<a href=\"http://logitech.com/zerotouch\" target=\"_self\">logitech.com/zerotouch</a>).</p>\n<p class=\"pullQuote\">I’ve encountered a few bumps in the road during my month-long review (pun intended), but I’ve concluded that the air-vent version of this holder fully justifies its lofty $60 price tag.</p>\n<p>I’ve encountered a few bumps in the road during my month-long review (pun intended), but I’ve concluded that the air-vent version (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/0touchventamz\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/0touchventamz</a>) of this holder fully justifies its lofty $60 price tag (simpler phone holders cost about 10 bucks.) The dashboard version (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/0touchdbamz\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/0touchdbamz</a>) has all the same features, but I’m not as enamored with it because it must be glued to your dashboard and it costs $80. Apple iPhone users, meanwhile, might want to stop reading now: the ZeroTouch is an Android-only device for the time being.</p>\n<p>The hiccups I encountered turned out to be not the fault of the product, but there is one other limitation (beyond being Android-only) that you’ll want to know about right up front. It’s not a bug, as the saying goes, it’s a feature: If you want the ZeroTouch’s (and Alexa’s) voice responses played through your car’s speakers, you’ll need to set your head unit to operate in media mode. That’s an Android requirement, but it makes it nearly impossible to listen to terrestrial radio on the head unit and interact with the Zero Touch—or Alexa—at the same time.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0134-0136/171509-1-eng-GB/f0134-012.jpg\" width=\"661\" height=\"442\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0134-01\" title=\"f0134-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>Icons and text</b> are prominently displayed, but you almost never need to look at the phone because a voice reads everything to you.</p>\n <span class=\"credit\">\nIMAGE: MICHAEL BROWN</span></figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>Fortunately, this doesn’t impact using Bluetooth to make and receive calls via your head unit. I’m accustomed to listening to NPR news broadcasts when I’m in the car, however, so I tried using the ZeroTouch independently of the head unit for a while. I don’t recommend it because it’s too distracting: The head unit’s radio will cut out when your phone rings, so you can answer the call, but it won’t do that for the ZeroTouch’s voice prompts. Those are played on the phone’s speaker while the head unit is playing the radio. I found myself constantly reaching for the head unit’s volume control either because the ZeroTouch was alerting me to an incoming message or because I wanted to use the ZeroTouch.</p>\n<p>If you want to listen to music on your car stereo, it’s far better to pair the ZeroTouch with your head unit and stream music from your phone over Bluetooth. The ZeroTouch supports Spotify, Deezer, Pandora, or Google Play Music. To do that, however, your car’s Bluetooth system must be capable of supporting both phone calls and media streaming. That wasn’t an issue with the new Kenwood KMM-BT515HD head unit I recently installed in my truck, but the Bluetooth in my 2010 VW Golf only allowed me to make and receive phone calls. The only way I could stream media and hear the ZeroTouch’s voice prompts on my phone in the car was to physically connect the phone’s headphone jack to the car’s aux input.</p>\n<p>I’ll dive deeper into this and the ZeroTouch’s other features later; for now, I want to focus on Logitech’s Alexa integration.</p>\n<h3><b>Alexa and the ZeroTouch</b></h3><p>In my home, I have several Amazon Echo devices connected to a Vivint smart home system that monitors my home’s security and controls nearly all its interior and exterior lighting, entry locks, thermostat, garage-door opener, and security cameras. I almost never reach out for a light switch, adjust the temperature at the thermostat, or even touch the Vivint Sky control panel (other than to disarm the system in the morning). Instead I tell Alexa to turn lights on and off, adjust the temperature, lock an exterior door, or arm the alarm system.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0135-0135/171502-1-eng-GB/f0135-012.jpg\" width=\"873\" height=\"583\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0135-01\" title=\"f0135-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>This model of</b> the Logitech ZeroTouch is designed to be glued to your dashboard. Make sure it doesn’t obstruct your view through the windshield, or you could be ticketed in some jurisdictions. (It’s obviously not permanently mounted in this photo.)</p>\n <span class=\"credit\">\nIMAGE: MICHAEL BROWN</span></figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>Before the ZeroTouch, I had to pull out my phone and launch the Vivint app if I needed to do any of those things from the car. And with 25 devices just for lighting control, it took a lot of scrolling to find the one I wanted to use. Now I just dock my phone to the ZeroTouch, briefly put my hand in front of its proximity detector (Logitech calls this gesture a “high five”), and summon Alexa.</p>\n<p>If it’s dark when I get home, I can tell Alexa to turn on the garage light before I get out of the car. If I forgot to arm the security system, close the garage door, or lock any entry door before I left, I can tell Alexa to do it from anywhere I have network access. And if I can’t remember what I did or didn’t do, I can ask Alexa to check for me.</p>\n<p>There are some things Alexa can’t do: She can’t disarm my security system, she can’t unlock doors, and she can’t open my garage door. Nor would I want her to, because Amazon’s cloud-based AI can’t distinguish an authorized user’s voice from that of a burglar—or a nosy neighbor, for that matter.</p>\n<p>In addition to controlling my smart home, Alexa in the car can do all the same things that Alexa in my house can do: She can estimate my commute time, tell me about the appointments on my calendar, give me a weather report, play news and sports updates, play music, read me a Kindle book, and a whole lot more. Don’t have an Echo at home? You don’t need one.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0136-0133/171495-1-eng-GB/f0136-012.jpg\" width=\"448\" height=\"416\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0136-01\" title=\"f0136-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>Logitech’s ZeroTouch automobile</b> smartphone mount has a battery-powered Bluetooth radio onboard. This model attaches to one of your car’s air vents.</p>\n <span class=\"credit\">\nIMAGE: LOGITECH</span></figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>Beyond Alexa</b></h3><p>The ZeroTouch is a great Android accessory even without its Alexa integration. It’s available in two form factors: A black dashboard mount with an adhesive bottom that sells for $80, and a black, white, or red air vent model ($60) that clips to one of your car’s air vents. The presence of a coin-cell-powered Bluetooth radio in each model explains why they cost so much. These are much more than just phone holders. That said, I think the less-expensive air vent model is the better value. Own more than one car or have more than one smartphone in your household? You can pair your phone with multiple mounts, and each mount can be paired with more than one phone (provided they’re Android phones).</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0137-0135/171488-1-eng-GB/f0137-012.jpg\" width=\"560\" height=\"535\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0137-01\" title=\"f0137-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>You can request</b> your favorite artists and playlists with Spotify with voice commands, such as “Play Ray Wylie Hubbard on Spotify.”</p>\n <span class=\"credit\">\nIMAGE: MICHAEL BROWN</span></figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>Both ZeroTouch models hold onto your phone via a magnet and require you to glue a metal plate to the back of your phone for this purpose. The 1.5-inch-long by .75-inch-wide plate is thin enough to fit inside most phone cases, and while the most logical place to put it is in the middle of the phone’s back—right about where the NFC antenna and wireless charging coil are located on my Samsung Galaxy S6 Active—I had no problem using NFC pairing. I don’t have a compatible wireless charging pad, however, so I couldn’t test for interference in that context. I can tell you that the mount is secure: I tested the air vent model in my full-sized 4x4 pickup and the mount never detached from the truck’s air vent and my phone never fell off the mount, even while driving over rough country roads.</p>\n<p>The ZeroTouch automatically detects when the phone is attached to the mount and launches the ZeroTouch app. If you receive a text message or an email (you can set up multiple email accounts, with one designated as the default), the app will chime, tell you who the message is from, and ask if you want to hear it. Respond “yes,” and the app will read the message and then ask if you want to respond. After you’ve dictated your response, the app will read it back to you and then ask if you want to send it.</p>\n<p>You need never take your eyes off the road or your hands off the wheel to accomplish any of this. If you’d prefer, you can configure the app to auto-reply (the default message reads “I’m driving and will get back to you once I’m off the road”). The process is similar for sending a text message or email, except that you need to give your phone a high five to wake the app first. Everything else is accomplished with voice commands.</p>\n<p>You can use voice commands for other tasks, too, including navigation. Give the ZeroTouch a high five and say “navigate,” and it will ask where you want to go. Answer the question and the app will tap the phone’s GPS and Google Maps. If you don’t know the address of your destination, you can say the name of the location or even the type of destination you’re looking for (“post office,” “gas station,” or “pizza,” for instance). The app will give you three choices, complete with Yelp ratings, and help you navigate to the one you choose. You can also save addresses for your home and work.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0138-0137/171481-1-eng-GB/f0138-012.jpg\" width=\"329\" height=\"583\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0138-01\" title=\"f0138-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>Forgot where you</b> parked your car?

For longer trips, I’ve been routinely connecting my phone to the head unit’s USB port so that the phone’s battery gets charged while I’m driving.</p>\n<p><b> Logitech ZeroTouch Air Vent Car Mount with Amazon Alexa</b></p>\n<p>$60</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0133-0135/171474-1-eng-GB/f0133-012.jpg\" width=\"96\" height=\"18\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0133-01\" title=\"f0133-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p><b> Logitech ZeroTouch Dashboard Car Mount with Amazon Alexa</b></p>\n<p>$80</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0133-0211/171467-1-eng-GB/f0133-022.jpg\" width=\"96\" height=\"18\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0133-02\" title=\"f0133-02\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div>","layout":{},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":1,"link_source":"","competition":[],"flatplan_title":"","notes":"","gutter_credit":"","other":"","image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1494015085.8054","name":"f0132-01","source":"IMAGE: LOGITECH","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0132-0140/171516-1-eng-GB/f0132-012.jpg?t=default_ipad_portrait&ext/f0132-012_default_ipad_portrait.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"768","height":"514","legacy_id":"17967","is_default":true},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1494015085.8054","name":"f0132-01","source":"IMAGE: LOGITECH","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0132-0140/171516-1-eng-GB/f0132-012.jpg?t=default_ipad_landscape&ext/f0132-012_default_ipad_landscape.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"1024","height":"685","legacy_id":"17967","is_default":false}],"related_objects":{"image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_7_1494015079.2173","name":"f0133-02","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0133-0211/171467-1-eng-GB/f0133-022.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"96","height":"18","legacy_id":"17960"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_7_1494015079.2173","name":"f0133-02","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0133-0211/171467-1-eng-GB/f0133-022.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"96","height":"18","legacy_id":"17960"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_6_1494015080.1524","name":"f0133-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0133-0135/171474-1-eng-GB/f0133-012.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"96","height":"18","legacy_id":"17961"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_6_1494015080.1524","name":"f0133-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0133-0135/171474-1-eng-GB/f0133-012.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"96","height":"18","legacy_id":"17961"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_5_1494015080.9985","name":"f0138-01","source":"IMAGE: LOGITECH","caption":"<p><b>Forgot where you</b> parked your car?

TAG Heuer had a surprise hit with its original TAG Heuer Connected, and now it’s embracing Android Wear 2.0 with the Connected Modular 45 (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/thconmod45\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/thconmod45</a>), an incredibly swank, finely machined, lusciously tactile smartwatch.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0141-0136/171587-1-eng-GB/f0141-012.jpg\" width=\"873\" height=\"496\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0141-01\" title=\"f0141-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>TAG Heuer Connected</b> Modular 45: Yes, these are all basically the same watch.</p>\n <span class=\"credit\">\nIMAGE: JON PHILLIPS</span></figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>No, make that a family. It’s a smartwatch family. No, scratch that. It’s a smartwatch <i>system</i>. Officially described as a Carrera model, the Connected Modular 45 comes in 11 essential designs, with 45 more looks available for special order. But because its lugs, straps, and buckles are all user-interchangeable, the Modular 45 is, well, whatever you want it to be—if you have the money to spend. Pricing starts at $1,650 and reaches all the way to “If you have to ask...”</p>\n<p>I’m a mechanical watch guy, and (disclosure) my first big watch splurge was a TAG Heuer Formula 1 in 2006. So I absolutely get the appeal of the Modular 45’s chiseled, brushed titanium case, and all the TAG Heuer flourishes and design cues. The 45mm case (ergo the name) definitely rises off the wrist with an aggressive posture, but the watches themselves are surprisingly light. The cases will visually overpower smaller anatomy, so small-boned buyers beware.</p>\n<p>It took me about 10 minutes to master TAG Heuer’s parts swapping system. Basically, you have three elements in play: The central module itself, then the lugs and straps.</p>\n<p>You first connect the lugs to the straps, which click right in, and secure with preciously fine pins. Next you connect the lugs to the case. It can be a fiddly procedure the first five or six times you try, and removing all the pieces is even a bit harder: To separate a lug from the case, you push a button, and then disengage the two pieces with jusssst the right angle of departure.</p>\n<p>But, hey, it’s a fine Swiss watch. If you buy the Modular 45, you’ll probably spend half a day manhandling it. You know, just getting to know it—obsessing over your purchase. So that’s plenty of time to master the parts-swapping system.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0142-0135/171580-1-eng-GB/f0142-012.jpg\" width=\"731\" height=\"304\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0142-01\" title=\"f0142-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>Here we see</b> the lug’s finely machined connecting points.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div>\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0142-027/171573-1-eng-GB/f0142-022.jpg\" width=\"732\" height=\"515\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0142-02\" title=\"f0142-02\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>The TAG Heuer</b> Connected Modular 45 really begins to show its size on a woman’s wrist.</p>\n <span class=\"credit\">\nTOP IMAGE: MATT STRAUSS; BOTTOM: JON PHILLIPS</span></figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>Endless customization</b></h3><p>Once everything was clicked in and secure, I gave my floor model watch a few purposeful tugs and wrist shakes. The watch withstood the abuse, but I was still left with sneaking concerns: Did I really lock all the parts together, and is this watch really as buckled down and secure as my TAG Heuer at home? Only time—and customer feedback—will tell. But nonetheless, I was eventually able to disassemble and reassemble a watch in under 15 seconds, so the TAG Heuer system is nothing if not expedient.</p>\n<p>I really can’t see more than a handful of people buying multiple parts so that they can frequently change the look of their Modular 45. But you will be able to buy lugs, straps, and buckles separately, so if you’re TAG Heuer-obsessed, have at it. The much more relevant point is that there are so many complete looks available for purchase.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0143-0129/171566-1-eng-GB/f0143-012.jpg\" width=\"873\" height=\"521\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0143-01\" title=\"f0143-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>The TAG Heuer</b> Connected Modular 45 bezels—dig the rose gold—are yet another customization point.

The three-hand Calibre 5 and the grande complication Tourbillon Heuer 02-T are traditional timepieces that employ the same hardware customization system as the Android Wear 2.0 versions.</p>\n<p>While I wouldn’t expect a tech geek to get multiple iterations of the Wear module, I can see a watch geek buying a smartwatch version and the Calibre 5 to swap out looks from day to night. It’s a compelling feature, and something only a mechanical watch company can offer.</p>\n<h3><b>A bit of Intel engineering</b></h3><p>Unlike so many Android Wear watches running Qualcomm’s Snapdragon Wear 2100 chip, the Modular 45 runs on Intel’s Atom Z34XX, a smartphone processor. Intel worked with TAG Heuer and Google to imbue the watch with a bit of extra artificial intelligence, and Intel also worked on special antenna technology to help Wi-Fi cut through the all-metal case. In effect, the watch’s antenna signal peeks through a seam between the bezel and the case itself.</p>\n<p>The watches are water-resistant to 50 meters, and the microphone hole can remain open when the Modular 45 is submerged in water.

There’s a proximity sensor on the bottom of the case that recognizes when the watch is on your wrist, and denies payments if you’re not actually wearing the watch.

The Ryzen 5 1600X’s value proposition is much clearer. With 6 overclockable cores and 12 threads, its competitor would be the $420 Core i7-6800K, in a vacuum—but we don’t live in a vacuum.

It’s a massacre.</p>\n<p>You’ll need to read PCWorld’s comprehensive Ryzen 5 1600X review for the detailed scoop on its performance. Here, we’re going to build one hell of an all-around system that basks in the Ryzen 5 1600X’s status as the jack—nay, the king—of all trades, and the best mainstream CPU powerhouse you can buy.</p>\n<h3><b>What’s inside the Ryzen 1600X PC</b></h3><p>While our Ryzen 7 1800X build celebrating the apex of all-AMD power contained several indulgences (the closed-loop cooler and premium power supply alone cost over $500), this build’s a bit more restrained. Don’t get me wrong: At a hair over $1,500, this isn’t a cheap PC. But it’s one designed to offer damned fine (though not best-in-class) performance in all computing areas—gaming, streaming, audio/video editing, programming, you name it—with a price-to-performance ratio that isn’t outrageous.</p>\n<p>Got it? Good. Let’s dig in.</p>\n<p><b>Processor:</b> The $250 Ryzen 5 1600X, duh. Haven’t you been paying attention? The 1600X’s 6 cores and 12 threads hum along between 3.6GHz and 4GHz, and since it’s rocking an “X” designation, AMD’s eXtended Frequency Range technology can up that top speed by another 100MHz if you’re rocking a particularly beefy CPU cooler.</p>\n<p><b>CPU cooler:</b> …which we’re not. Instead, this build utilizes the Wraith Max, the most potent (and RGB-laden) member of AMD’s Wraith cooler lineup, which the company sent us for testing. Intel stock coolers can’t hold a candle to this thing. Note, however, that while the Wraith Max will ship with select Ryzen models, it does not come bundled with the 1600X at this time.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0177-019/171933-1-eng-GB/f0177-012.jpg\" width=\"731\" height=\"400\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0177-01\" title=\"f0177-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>couSpoiler alert: AMD’s</b> Wraith Max in action.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div>\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0178-0113/171926-1-eng-GB/f0178-012.jpg\" width=\"591\" height=\"378\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0178-01\" title=\"f0178-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>The Gigabyte Aorus</b> AX370- Gaming 5 motherboard.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>Since you’ll need to pick up your own cooler for the Ryzen 5 1600X, we have a few recommendations: The Cooler Master Hyper 212 Evo ($30 on Amazon) is our go-to for folks who want a solid CPU cooler without breaking the bank, and Cooler Master will send you an AMD AM4 motherboard bracket if you ask. If you want to push the fastest overclocks possible, the superb Noctua NH-D15 air cooler offers an AM4-specific variant for $90 on Newegg, while Corsair—like Cooler Master—will send you AM4 mounting hardware for the popular Hydro H100i v2 closed-loop liquid cooler ($120 on Amazon) if you ask for it.</p>\n<p><b>Motherboard:</b> After careful consideration, I decided to go with the same Gigabyte Aorus AX370-Gaming 5 motherboard ($195 on Amazon and Newegg, though often sold out) used in PCWorld’s previous Ryzen 7 1800X build. As I explained in PCWorld’s Ryzen motherboard breakdown (see page 13), the X370 and B350 chipsets for AM4 motherboards are largely similar, but the little extras found in high-end X370 boards make sense in a versatile build like this. Compared to a B350 board, X370 offers two extra SATA connections, two additional PCIe lanes, four more USB 3 ports, and CrossFire/SLI support for systems with multiple graphics cards.</p>\n<p>If you don’t think you’ll need those perks, consider swapping this out for a B350 board to save a sizeable chunk o’ cash. I’ve had good experiences with Gigabyte’s GA-AB350 Gaming 3 ($110 on Newegg), and rival boards like the Asus Prime B350 Plus ($100 on Amazon) and MSI’s B350 Tomahawk ($110 on Newegg) sell for roughly the same price.</p>\n<p>So why’d we go with the Aorus AX370-Gaming 5 in particular? Already having it on hand certainly didn’t hurt. But beyond that convenience, the Gaming 5’s an early star in the AM4 motherboard lineup. It’s attractive, loaded with all the features you could ask for (including M.2 and U.2 SSD support), and includes nifty extras like RGB Fusion and Smart Fan 5 technology baked right into the BIOS. Speaking of the BIOS, that’s another Gaming 5 strength. Many Ryzen motherboards lack polish and stability in these early days of the all-new AM4 platform, but Gigabyte’s motherboard has been solid as a rock in my extensive testing.</p>\n<p><b>Memory:</b> AMD sent Geil’s Evo X 16GB DDR4 kit ($125 on Newegg) along with the Ryzen 5 review kit, clocked at 3,200MHz. We decided to use it for a few different reasons.</p>\n<p>Depending on the application you’re using, Ryzen performance can respond greatly to memory speed—but in these early days, memory support is finicky on many AM4 mother-boards. The capacity is right on the money, too; you could get by with 8GB if you’re gaming and slinging Office docs alone, but 16GB is more welcome in productivity and editing machines. Oh, and I’m a sucker for RGB lighting, and Geil’s RAM rocks LEDs that can illuminate your case.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0179-0110/171919-1-eng-GB/f0179-012.jpg\" width=\"358\" height=\"361\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0179-01\" title=\"f0179-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>Those lit-up Geil</b> Evo X RAM sticks sure look good.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>That said, Geil’s Evo X won’t be for everyone even if you dig RGB. Those lights require additional cables that feature red wiring rather than all-black sleeves, which can be an eyesore if you’re an aesthetics freak. The cables add some additional frustrations as well, which we’ll cover in the build guide. The Evo X sticks are downright massive, too, which could be an issue if you plan on using a CPU cooler with a large heat sink. They sure do look pretty though.</p>\n<p>If low-profile RAM—in both stature and aesthetics—is more your taste, Corsair’s Vengeance LPX 16GB DDR4 kit will set you back the same $125 on Amazon.</p>\n<p><b>Graphics:</b> Nvidia’s GeForce GTX 1070 Founders Edition ($380 on Amazon) delivers tremendous 1440p and 1080p gaming prowess at significantly less cost than the GTX 1080 or 1080 Ti, along with great graphics power for image and video editing. It’s what PCWorld’s video guru uses in his personal rig, and that’s good enough for me. Thematically, I’d have preferred to use an Radeon card, but a GTX 1070 competitor won’t show up (presumably) until AMD’s Radeon Vega appears.</p>\n<p>Nvidia partners like EVGA, Zotac, and MSI offer customized GTX 1070s with higher clock speeds and beefier coolers, which many gamers prefer. Those graphics cards eject hot air back down into your system, however, whereas the Founders Edition uses a blower-style cooler that pushes the heat out the I/O ports on the rear of your system. That makes the Founders Edition cards more compelling if you’re using a tiny chassis.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0180-0111/171912-1-eng-GB/f0180-012.jpg\" width=\"873\" height=\"446\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0180-01\" title=\"f0180-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>The GTX 1070</b> Founders Edition.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>Spoiler warning!</p>\n<p><b>Case:</b> We’re using a tiny chassis. In fact, we’re using the same Corsair Carbide 400C ($100 on Amazon) featured in our Ryzen 7 1800X build. Stuffing so much power into a puny case is fun! I’d considered using a luxurious Phanteks Enthoo Evolv ATX Tempered Glass ($190 on Amazon) that I have on hand, just to jazz things up a bit, but then I remembered that this build revolves around smart buying decisions to offer as much all-around performance as possible. (You’ll see where the extra money went in a bit.)</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0181-015/171905-1-eng-GB/f0181-012.jpg\" width=\"248\" height=\"340\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0181-01\" title=\"f0181-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>Corsair’s Carbide 400C</b> case: small, yet spacious and well thought-out.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>The Corsair 400C it is, and without regrets—it’s a damned good mainstream case.</p>\n<p><b>Power supply:</b> PC hardware doesn’t demand anywhere near as much electricity as it used to, but I’m still a firm believer in buying an efficient power supply from a respected brand. The EVGA Supernova 650 P2 ($110 on Amazon) fits the bill nicely. It’s 80 Plus Platinum certified, and you don’t need more than 650 watts in a modern system with a CPU and a single graphics card.</p>\n<p><b>Storage:</b> Here’s the hardware we splurged on with the savings in other areas. The 512GB Samsung 960 Pro ($330 on Amazon, but provided by AMD for this build) doesn’t come cheap. Nor should it; it’s hands-down the speediest SSD to ever cross PCWorld’s lab. It’s ludicrously fast.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0181-02/171898-1-eng-GB/f0181-022.jpg\" width=\"375\" height=\"247\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0181-02\" title=\"f0181-02\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>The Samsung 960</b> Pro.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>While near-instantaneous boot times are nice on any system, the Samsung 960 Pro’s speed would be wasted if you mostly plan on gaming, slinging Office docs, and other everyday tasks. This beast burns through large file transfers, though, making it a worthwhile—if pricey—investment for creative professionals, streamers who edit video files, or anybody else doing plus-sized work on the regular.</p>\n<p>If that doesn’t sound like you, consider picking up another drive instead. We still like Samsung’s 850 EVO for general use, and at $178 on Amazon for the 512GB model, it’s roughly half the price of the speedy 960 Pro. Other SSDs can be found for even less if you’re not picky.</p>\n<p><b>The extras:</b> Add it all up and you’re looking at a grand total of $1,520 for this Ryzen 5 1600X system. That doesn’t include the price of Windows 10, keyboard and mouse, or a monitor however— build guides like this generally assume you have those available to bring over from another system. If you don’t, however, expect to spend a bit more.</p>\n<p>You can pick up a basic mouse and keyboard pretty cheaply if you want, or if you’re looking for nicer gear to match the overall quality level of this build, PCWorld’s guide to the best gaming mice (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/gamingmice\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/gamingmice</a>) and best gaming keyboard (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/gamingkboards17\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/gamingkboards17</a>) can help. Windows 10 Home costs $119, (the Pro version is $199), though you can often find product keys available for under $30 on Kinguin (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com</a>/ kinguinw10hm), which is sort of like eBay for software. And if you’re into hardcore audio editing, a dedicated top-end sound card like the Sound Blaster ZxR will set you back another $233 on Amazon, or less if you don’t need all the ZxR’s bells and whistles.</p>\n<p>Enough chatter.

We’re just going to go over the broad strokes and aspects unique to this particular build here.</p>\n<p>As always, I started by building out the motherboard first—it’s easier to install the major components before your motherboard’s in the case.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0183-018/171884-1-eng-GB/f0183-012.jpg\" width=\"591\" height=\"358\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0183-01\" title=\"f0183-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>The Samsung 960</b> Pro blends right in on the Aorus Gaming 5 motherboard even before you add a graphics card.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>Since the Samsung 960 Pro’s an NVMe SSD, my very first step was slotting that into place and screwing it in. Gigabyte’s Ryzen motherboards slap the M.2 slot under the first PCIe slot, which means your SSD is covered by your graphics card. It’s not ideal—I prefer the M.2 connector over the PCIe slot, to keep your GPU’s hot air from exhausting onto your M.2 SSD—but I’ve never noticed performance loss from placement like this.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0183-023/171877-1-eng-GB/f0183-022.jpg\" width=\"364\" height=\"232\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0183-02\" title=\"f0183-02\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>Come.

(Be sure to read your motherboard manual to make sure you install your modules in the optimal slots for your configuration!)</p>\n<p>The Gaming 5 includes an RGB header to sync RGB-equipped devices with the motherboard’s lights using Gigabyte’s BIOS-based RGB Fusion software. The Geil Evo X includes a cable to connect the memory to an RGB header. Sweet, right? Nope. The RGB cable bundled with the Evo X is incredibly short—far too short to reach the RGB header on the left side of the board, where Gigabyte and most other motherboards place it. So rather than syncing the RAM’s colors with the motherboard, I instead had to use a secondary cable (with the aforementioned ugly red wires) that connects to a system fan header for power. Doing so limits you to using the Evo X’s native red, blue, or green lighting presets.</p>\n<p>Ugh.</p>\n<p>Installing the Ryzen 1600X itself was simple. Just match the corner with the triangle on the bottom of the processor with the matching triangle on motherboard socket. It should slip right in, then you secure it in place with the retention lever. Easy-peasy!</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0184-0110/171870-1-eng-GB/f0184-012.jpg\" width=\"505\" height=\"378\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0184-01\" title=\"f0184-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>The Ryzen 5</b> 1600X in the motherboard.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>Setting up the Wraith Max cooler proved mostly straightforward as well. It uses a retention scheme that clips onto to the AM4 socket’s native mounting hardware, so you won’t need to swap anything out or muck around with bolts.</p>\n<p>That said, this installation reminded me how much I prefer bolt-based CPU coolers. The heatsink at the top of the motherboard doesn’t leave much room to get your fingers in there to secure the Wraith Max’s clip, so the Wraith’s heat sink moved around a lot as I struggled to secure it—which meant the pre-applied thermal paste didn’t create a solid seal with the processor. I wound up having to uninstall the Wraith Max completely after building the PC to reapply new thermal paste after seeing extraordinarily high temperatures after my initial installation.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0185-018/171863-1-eng-GB/f0185-012.jpg\" width=\"589\" height=\"349\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0185-01\" title=\"f0185-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>The Wraith Max’s</b> RGB effect is subtle, classy, and completely optional rather than over the top.

The Wraith Max’s RGB connector is at the bottom-left of the fan; there’s maybe an inch of physical space separating it from the motherboard RGB header. But the RGB cord AMD ships with the Wraith Max is roughly a foot long. That means you need to find something to do with all that cabling, but the length is too short to, say, cleanly route it out to a motherboard cut-out and then back in from another.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0186-018/171849-1-eng-GB/f0186-012.jpg\" width=\"592\" height=\"334\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0186-01\" title=\"f0186-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>The Corsair Carbide</b> 400C makes cable management a breeze.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>I wound up having to loosely tie the cable together and trail it across the middle of the motherboard, which doesn’t look horrible in the final build, but definitely isn’t ideal.</p>\n<p>Those are all nitpicks though.

It’s leaps and bounds better than stock Intel coolers.</p>\n<p>The rest of the Ryzen 1600X build went together quickly and easily. Despite its tiny stature, the Corsair 400C includes ample space above the motherboard to route your topmost cables, unlike some other cases in this price range. It also features nice rubber grommets in each of the motherboard cut-outs, and a power supply cover that hides the mess of wires snaking out from your PSU—not that there’s many in this build, as the EVGA Supernova 650 P2 is fully modular.</p>\n<h3><b>Performance results</b></h3><p>Everything worked just fine the first time I booted up the Ryzen 7 1600X rig.

PCWorld’s guide to AMD’s Ryzen Master (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/ryzenmaster\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/ryzenmaster</a>) overclocking software can help on that front. The Wraith Max ran quiet and kept temperatures reasonable even under heavy gaming loads, but if you’re looking to crank clock speeds to the max, I’d definitely recommend investing in an aftermarket cooler.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0188-0111/171828-1-eng-GB/f0188-012.jpg\" width=\"329\" height=\"390\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0188-01\" title=\"f0188-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>The completed Ryzen</b> 5 1600X build.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>For more information on the build’s processing and file transfer chops, be sure to check out PCWorld’s Ryzen 5 1600X review (see page 107) and Samsung 960 Pro review (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/ss960prorv\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/ss960prorv</a>) for the full low-down on that hardware.</p>\n<p>All in all, I consider this build a rousing success. It’s small, it’s clean, it’s relatively quiet, and it’s incredibly versatile. The only part I’d change is the RAM—not because it’s underpowered, but because the situation with the RGB header cord irks me so much. (Hey, I’m vain when it comes to my builds.)</p>\n<p>A PC built around a Core i5-7600K might beat this system in pure gaming performance, but not by much with a GTX 1070 in tow, and Intel’s chip wouldn’t come close to this Ryzen 1600X PC’s productivity prowess. Hail to AMD’s new midrange champion.</p>\n","layout":{},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":1,"link_source":"","competition":[],"flatplan_title":"","notes":"","gutter_credit":"","other":"","image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1494015141.4493","name":"f0175-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0175-0110/171947-1-eng-GB/f0175-012.jpg?t=default_ipad_portrait&ext/f0175-012_default_ipad_portrait.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"768","height":"508","legacy_id":"18024","is_default":true},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1494015141.4493","name":"f0175-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0175-0110/171947-1-eng-GB/f0175-012.jpg?t=default_ipad_landscape&ext/f0175-012_default_ipad_landscape.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"1024","height":"678","legacy_id":"18024","is_default":false}],"related_objects":{"image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_17_1494015124.8245","name":"f0188-01","source":"","caption":"<p><b>The

Memorizing key combinations takes some work, but once you have, shortcuts make using an operating system so much more efficient.</p>\n<p>Many people know the everyday keyboard shortcuts (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/20w10keycuts\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/20w10keycuts</a>), such as how to copy, cut, and paste text with the keyboard, how to close a window, and how to lock a PC.</p>\n<p>That’s a solid start—but there are even more powerful keyboard shortcuts lurking beyond the basics. Here are some of our favorite less commonly used shortcuts. We’ve grouped these by operating system to make it easier for users of Windows 7, 8.1, and 10 to see what’s available for their system.</p>\n<h3><b>Windows 7 and up</b></h3><p>• <i>F2</i>: Prepare selected file for renaming—no more careful clicking.</p>\n<p>• <i>Alt</i> + <i>Enter</i>: Select a file and then use this shortcut to display its properties</p>\n<p>• Windows Key + <i>M</i>: Minimize all windows to the taskbar (Windows Key + S<i>hift</i> + <i>M</i> restores them).</p>\n<p>• Windows Key + <i>Home</i>: Minimize everything but the active window</p>\n<p>• Windows Key + <i>Pause</i>: Display the system properties dialog box</p>\n<p>• Windows key + <i>Shift</i> + right or left arrow: Move the active window to the next monitor in the direction indicated</p>\n<p>• <i>Ctrl</i> + <i>Y</i>: Redo an action (the opposite of Ctrl + Z)</p>\n<h3><b>Windows 8.1 and up</b></h3><p>• Windows Key + comma key: Peek at the desktop</p>\n<h3><b>Windows 10 only</b></h3><p>• Windows key + <i>Alt</i> + <i>D</i>: Display the time and calendar panel (equivalent of clicking the time on the taskbar)</p>\n<p>• Windows key + <i>Tab</i>: Open task view. Remember Task View (go. <a href=\"http://pcworld.com/w10taskview\" target=\"_self\">pcworld.com/w10taskview</a>)? It’s how you create virtual desktops in Windows 10.

(Well, except Bryan Lunduke, who will say it sucks before he says it’s awesome; <a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/linuxsucks\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/linuxsucks</a>.) For the desktop user, the freedom from worry about most viruses is a big plus, and not spending $100 upgrading Windows is a big plus too.</p>\n<p>As awesome as Linux is for desktop use, Linux (and BSD for that matter) truly shines as a server. While providing web-based services is one of those server-y things Linux does really well, Linux can do a lot more than host a blog about family outings</p>\n<p>If you’re looking to host your own services instead of paying for or relying on those in the cloud, running your own home server is one of the best ways to keep your files private.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0191-018/172040-1-eng-GB/f0191-012.jpg\" width=\"873\" height=\"490\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0191-01\" title=\"f0191-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n <span class=\"credit\">\nIMAGE: PCBOTS</span></figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>Choosing software</b></h3><p>Choosing the specific Linux distribution for your home server can be daunting in itself since there are so many strains to choose from. Most of the time, I just roll with Ubuntu and recommend that first-time users do the same. The reason is simple: Ubuntu Server is easy to administer, well documented, and has a pretty low learning curve, especially if you’ve ever used desktop Ubuntu. (See these instructions for installing Ubuntu Server, go. <a href=\"http://pcworld.com/installubuntusvr\" target=\"_self\">pcworld.com/installubuntusvr</a>.)</p>\n<p class=\"pullQuote\">There is a huge amount of free and open-source software you can host yourself, but finding it can be tricky.</p>\n<p>The next big thing you’ll have to worry about is what programs to run on the server. There is a huge amount of free and open-source software you can host yourself, but finding it can be tricky. Luckily, a GitHub user named Edward D. maintains a list of self-hosted software (<a href=\"http://github.com/Kickball/awesome-selfhosted\" target=\"_self\">github.com/Kickball/awesome-selfhosted</a>) that you can run on a Linux server. The list has everything from blog software to CRM. It even features some awesome meta packages (which let you bulk-install a group of applications) like sovereign (<a href=\"http://github.com/sovereign/sovereign\" target=\"_self\">github.com/sovereign/sovereign</a>).</p>\n<p>Indeed, sovereign is a good starting point for users who are looking to be digitally self-reliant. With a couple commands, sovereign will install an email server, a VPN service, nightly backups, a CalDAV and CardDAV server, and ownCloud, just to name a few.</p>\n<p>Once you have an idea of what you want to host on your server, the next step is choosing the right hardware.</p>\n<h3><b>Choosing hardware</b></h3><h4><b>Recycling: Free</b></h4><p>One of the most common ways to use Linux in a home server is to install the OS on an old desktop.</p>\n<p>The hardware requirements for Windows have marched forward as time and Windows versions have progressed. While you might technically get Windows 10 to run on a PC that’s been sitting in the garage for five years, its performance might be less than ideal.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0193-018/172033-1-eng-GB/f0193-012.jpg\" width=\"873\" height=\"520\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0193-01\" title=\"f0193-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>That old PC could be a nice host for Linux. On top of saving you some money, repurposing an old PC as a Linux server is good for the environment. Reusing the PC keeps e-waste out of landfills (you do know PCs shouldn’t go in the garbage bin, right?) and stretches the life of the heavy metals and precious and/or toxic materials that comprise many PC parts.</p>\n<h3><b>Raspberry Pi 3: $35 and up</b></h3><p>There’s a reason people love the little Raspberry Pi (go. <a href=\"http://pcworld.com/raspberry\" target=\"_self\">pcworld.com/raspberry</a> pi3): For 35 bucks you get a palm-sized computer that has networking, USB ports, and general-purpose pins to satisfy all of your tinkering needs. While the Pi is a great tinkerer’s toy, it’s also great as a low-power server.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0193-022/172026-1-eng-GB/f0193-022.jpg\" width=\"501\" height=\"304\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0193-02\" title=\"f0193-02\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n <span class=\"credit\">\nRIGHT: AMAZON</span></figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>The Raspberry Pi is powered via a Micro-USB connection and sips power compared to big desktop components. If you’re looking for a server to host just a couple of services to a small number of users (like you and your roommate), the Pi is a wonderful platform to start with.</p>\n<p>The Pi doesn’t have any storage onboard, but if you plan on running a file or media server with it, you can always buy or reuse an external USB hard drive or a large USB stick.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0194-018/172019-1-eng-GB/f0194-012.jpg\" width=\"741\" height=\"193\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0194-01\" title=\"f0194-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n <span class=\"credit\">\nIMAGE: INTEL</span></figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>NUCs and small PCs: $179 and up</b></h3><p>Small PCs are often marketed as low-powered desktops or home-theater PCs, but they also make great servers. Intel’s Next Unit of Computing (NUC) models (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/nucamz\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/nucamz</a>) are well equipped for light- to medium-duty server use in a home.</p>\n<p>Much more robust than their ARM-based Raspberry Pi counterparts, Intel’s NUCs will consume more power but be able to handle more computationally intensive tasks. Some NUC models will have room for a 2.5-inch SSD for onboard storage. Other models will force you to outsource bulk storage of big files to an external drive, not unlike the Pi.</p>\n<p>If you prefer AMD to Intel, there are some other options as well, including Gigabyte’s Brix, which offers many of the same features as the NUC.</p>\n<h3><b>Network attached storage (NAS) appliances: $150 and up</b></h3><p>If you’re worried you don’t have the technical chops to install and maintain your own Linux server, you can always go for a network attached storage (NAS) system. A NAS is basically a small Linux or BSD server with the primary function of hosting files. You can think of a NAS as your own extensible Google Drive or Dropbox.</p>\n<p>Lots of companies offer NAS solutions in one form or another, but two of the big names are QNAP and Synology. Both companies offer many of the same features, but the web interfaces are different for each.</p>\n<p>For small businesses that just need something to work, a medium-sized NAS can be a simple, plug-and-play solution. With a NAS, you generally don’t have to fight with drivers or settings during setup; everything can be accomplished using an easy-to-follow web interface.</p>\n<p>While you can find diskless NAS devices for as little as $150, they will—naturally—come without any hard drives. Hard drives for NAS boxes tend to cost a little more than the typical desktop hard drive, since they are designed to be always-on, and to keep data safe for a long period of time.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0195-018/172012-1-eng-GB/f0195-012.jpg\" width=\"392\" height=\"464\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0195-01\" title=\"f0195-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>Synology DS716+II</b></p>\n <span class=\"credit\">\nIMAGE: AMAZON</span></figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>Virtual private server (VPS): $5/month and up</b></h3><p>Okay, so this isn’t a way to have a Linux server in the home. A virtual private server is exactly what it sounds like: a virtual machine instance in a server farm. “Private” refers to the fact that other VPS machines in the same server farm can’t steal resources or interact with your VPS. In effect, it’s like having your own little Linux box connected to a server farm somewhere.</p>\n<p>VPS solutions can be great if you need to run a small blog or some other service that you’d rather not run from home. Unlike running a service on a home server, a VPS does not require you to open up ports on your router and fiddle with dynamic DNS.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0196-018/172005-1-eng-GB/f0196-012.jpg\" width=\"731\" height=\"486\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0196-01\" title=\"f0196-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>Servers at SAP’s</b> facility in St. Leon-Rot, Germany.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>Of the VPS providers out there, Digital Ocean offers some of the better deals for the individual or small business.

QUESTION I</b> often get from potential cord cutters is whether they can still watch the news without cable. These days, it’s easier to accomplish than ever, as more companies invest in streaming the news, and streaming channel bundles emerge with access to major cable news networks such as CNN, Fox News, and MSNBC.</p>\n<p>I first wrote about cable-free news options in 2015 (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com</a>/ cordcut2015). Here’s an update that includes all the best services and apps to emerge since then;</p>\n<h3><b>National broadcast news networks</b></h3><p><b>CBS News:</b> Not to be confused with CBS’s nightly and weekly broadcasts, this round-the-clock streaming service provides anchored news coverage throughout the day and live broadcasts of major events. In a sense, it’s an antidote to cable news, with a heavy emphasis on reported stories instead of talking heads. For cord cutters, it’s a must-see. Available on: Roku, Amazon Fire TV, Apple TV, Android TV, and Xbox</p>\n<p><b>CBS/CBS All Access:</b> The main CBS app includes the latest episodes of the broadcaster’s major news programs, including <i>CBS Evening News</i>, <i>60 Minutes</i>, and <i>Face the Nation</i>. Those programs can be accessed for free on mobile devices and televisions via Chromecast, though other TV devices require a $6-per-month CBS All Access subscription.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0198-014/172090-1-eng-GB/f0198-012.jpg\" width=\"718\" height=\"429\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0198-01\" title=\"f0198-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n <span class=\"credit\">\nIMAGE: CBSN</span></figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div>\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0199-016/172083-1-eng-GB/f0199-012.jpg\" width=\"873\" height=\"492\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0199-01\" title=\"f0199-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n <span class=\"credit\">\nIMAGE: NEWSON</span></figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>AVAILABLE ON: Roku, Amazon Fire TV, Apple TV, Android TV, Chromecast, Xbox, and PlayStation 4</p>\n<p><b>NBC News:</b> This app is worth considering if only for its full Nightly News broadcasts, which become available for streaming the day after they air. Clips from <i>Meet the Press</i> and MSNBC programs are also available for good measure. <b>AVAILABLE ON:</b> Roku, Amazon Fire TV, Apple TV, and Android TV</p>\n<h3><b>Local news</b></h3><p><b>NewsOn:</b> This local news venture provides live and on-demand broadcasts from more than 170 stations across 111 U.S. markets. These are the same newscasts that air on local ABC, CBS, NBC, and Fox stations, and they’re free with ads. You can even tune into stations outside your area to see what’s happening elsewhere in the country. <b>AVAILABLE ON:</b> Roku</p>\n<p><b>Antenna:</b> Over-the-air antenna remains an excellent way to watch the local news, provided you can get reception in your home. You’ll find TechHive’s top picks (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/bestdigants\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/bestdigants</a>).</p>\n<p><b>CBS All Access:</b> The $6-per-month streaming service provides local channel feeds in many markets, so you can watch live newscasts from your local station. <b>AVAILABLE ON:</b> Roku, Amazon Fire TV, Apple TV, Android TV, Chromecast, Xbox, and PlayStation 4</p>\n<p><b>The wild world of standalone apps:</b> Your local news station may offer its own app for streaming devices, but not all of these apps have live feeds, and the quality of each app can vary by area, network, and station owner. I recommend searching your device’s app store for the name of your nearest city or the call signs of your local stations to see what’s available.</p>\n<h3><b>Alternative streaming news sources</b></h3><p><b><a href=\"http://Haystack.tv\" target=\"_self\">Haystack.tv</a>:</b> This slick app lets you create your own personalized newscast based on the topics and sources that interest you. It also includes local news clips in some areas. <b>AVAILABLE ON:</b> Amazon Fire TV, Android TV, Apple TV, and Chromecast</p>\n<p><b>Roku News:</b> For quickly catching up on national stories, the often-overlooked built-in news feed on Roku players is surprisingly useful. On the home screen, just scroll down to “News,” then push your remote’s play button for a quick succession of clips from various sources. AVAILABLE ON: Roku players and Roku-powered smart TVs</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0200-017/172076-1-eng-GB/f0200-012.jpg\" width=\"873\" height=\"583\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0200-01\" title=\"f0200-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n <span class=\"credit\">\nIMAGE: HAYSTACK</span></figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div>\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0201-017/172069-1-eng-GB/f0201-012.jpg\" width=\"873\" height=\"494\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0201-01\" title=\"f0201-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n <span class=\"credit\">\nIMAGE: JARED NEWMAN</span></figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p><b>Pluto TV:</b> Pluto turns online video sources into cable-like channels that you can flip through, and many of those sources cover the news. Install this app, and you can tune into round-the-clock feeds from NBC, CNBC, TYT Network, NewsmaxTV, Newsy, RT America, Sky News, Bloomberg, and Cheddar. AVAILABLE ON: Roku, Amazon Fire TV, Android TV, Apple TV, and Chromecast</p>\n<p><b>Newsy:</b> The nice thing about Newsy’s TV app is how it immediately launches into a brief rundown of the latest top stories. You’re then free to peruse the rest of the Newsy app, which includes a live news feed and an assortment of clips, all explaining the news with a bit of useful context thrown in. AVAILABLE ON: Roku, Amazon Fire TV, Apple TV, Chromecast</p>\n<h3><b>Cable news networks</b></h3><p><b>Sling TV:</b> Both the $20-per-month Sling Orange plan and the $25-per-month Sling Blue plan include CNN and Bloomberg, but not Fox News or MSNBC. The $5-per-month News Extra add-on includes several other news networks, including HLN, Fusion, and BBC World News. AVAILABLE ON: Roku, Amazon Fire TV, Apple TV, Android TV, Chromecast, and Xbox</p>\n<p><b>PlayStation Vue:</b> With the $30-per-month Access Slim plan, you get CNN, Fox News, MSNBC, HLN, Fox Business, and CNBC. In some markets where local broadcast feeds are available, that price jumps to $40 per month for the Access plan. BBC World News requires an Elite plan for $15 per month more. AVAILABLE ON: Roku, Amazon Fire TV, Apple TV, Android TV, Chromecast, and PlayStation consoles</p>\n<p><b>DirecTV Now:</b> The $35-per-month “Live a Little” plan includes CNN, Fox News, HLN, MSNBC, Fox Business, CNBC, and Bloomberg. To get BBC World News, you’ll need the $60-per-month “Go Big” plan. AVAILABLE ON: Roku, Amazon Fire TV, Apple TV</p>\n<p><b>CNN:</b> The moocher’s route: Unlike the other big cable networks, CNN offers a streaming app on TV devices with a live feed, though you need a cable login to access it.
