Perhaps more interestingly, for the first time Microsoft has detailed information about the user data it collects for diagnostics.</p>\n<h3><b>Diagnostics collection</b></h3><p>Let’s start with the diagnostics collection, as Microsoft’s come under heavy fire from privacy advocates for refusing to allow users to disable it completely while simultaneously refusing to detail exactly what information Windows 10 collects from users.</p>\n<p>Microsoft published two Technet pages describing the data Microsoft collects from users on the Creators Update. There are two levels of diagnostic data: basic (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/technetbasic\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/technetbasic</a>) and full (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/technetfull\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/technetfull</a>). The information is quite detailed and we won’t get into it here, but if you’re interested, you can find all the nitty-gritty details in those links. Note that while the Basic listing reveals all, the Full listing is a summary of the <i>kinds</i> of data that setting collects.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0055-0149/170666-1-eng-GB/f0055-012.jpg\" width=\"530\" height=\"398\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0055-01\" title=\"f0055-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>Windows 10’s privacy</b> dashboard at installation.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>Even the basic level can gather quite a bit of info from your PC, though in a blog post, Windows chief Terry Myerson pledges that “we only collect data at the Basic level that is necessary to keep your Windows 10 device secure and up to date.” Microsoft still offers no native way to turn off Windows 10’s diagnostic collection completely.</p>\n<h3><b>Privacy dashboard</b></h3><p>Instead of a string of screens when you first install the new version of Windows 10, Microsoft is putting all the key privacy settings on one screen. The dashboard you’ll see depends on whether you’re already running Windows 10 on your machine or setting up a new PC for the first time.</p>\n<p>Both dashboards show the same information but are arranged differently. The first-time installation version is a full-screen experience with a blue background similar to other installation screens. Current Windows 10 installs will see what looks like a Settings app screen that shows up after scheduling a Creators Update upgrade.</p>\n<p>There are five privacy options that include: Location, Diagnostics, Relevant Ads, Speech Recognition, and Tailored Experiences With Diagnostic Data. That last item is a fancy way to say “tips and recommendations,” or as most Windows 10 users call it, “stuff I don’t want.” Each screen also has a Learn More button to get detailed information about the privacy settings if the short descriptions aren’t enough.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0056-0158/170659-1-eng-GB/f0056-012.jpg\" width=\"539\" height=\"354\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0056-01\" title=\"f0056-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>The Creators Update</b> privacy dashboard during an upgrade.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>Windows 10 Mobile users will see a similar privacy dashboard, though phones have a cellular data toggle and no tailored experiences option.</p>\n<p><b>Why this matters:</b> With Windows 10’s focus on Windows as a service and built-in cloud-based features like Cortana, the company has stirred up a lot of privacy concerns (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/w10privacy\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/w10privacy</a>). This new transparency gives users a better sense of what information is being collected—and why. The new privacy dashboards also put in one place most of the personal information the operating system wants to use on a regular basis. It’s a smart move on Microsoft’s part. As the Creators Update rolls out we’ll see whether this new information puts users at ease or just increases the concerns over data collection.</p>\n","layout":{},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":1,"link_source":"","competition":[],"flatplan_title":"","notes":"","gutter_credit":"","other":"","image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1494014990.7952","name":"f0054-01","source":"IMAGE: THINKSTOCK","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0054-0160/170673-1-eng-GB/f0054-012.jpg?t=default_ipad_portrait&ext/f0054-012_default_ipad_portrait.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"768","height":"496","legacy_id":"17858","is_default":true},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1494014990.7952","name":"f0054-01","source":"IMAGE: THINKSTOCK","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0054-0160/170673-1-eng-GB/f0054-012.jpg?t=default_ipad_landscape&ext/f0054-012_default_ipad_landscape.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"1024","height":"661","legacy_id":"17858","is_default":false}],"related_objects":{"image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_2_1494014988.8349","name":"f0056-01","source":"","caption":"<p><b>The Creators Update</b> privacy dashboard during an upgrade.</p>\n","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0056-0158/170659-1-eng-GB/f0056-012.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"539","height":"354","legacy_id":"17856"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_2_1494014988.8349","name":"f0056-01","source":"","caption":"<p><b>The Creators Update</b> privacy dashboard during an upgrade.</p>\n","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0056-0158/170659-1-eng-GB/f0056-012.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"539","height":"354","legacy_id":"17856"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_1_1494014989.7656","name":"f0055-01","source":"","caption":"<p><b>Windows 10’s privacy</b> dashboard at installation.</p>\n","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0055-0149/170666-1-eng-GB/f0055-012.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"530","height":"398","legacy_id":"17857"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_1_1494014989.7656","name":"f0055-01","source":"","caption":"<p><b>Windows 10’s privacy</b> dashboard at installation.</p>\n","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0055-0149/170666-1-eng-GB/f0055-012.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"530","height":"398","legacy_id":"17857"}]},"url_alias":"http://pcworld-us.audiencemedia.com","type":"story","order":"11","folio_number":"54","folio_numbers":"54,55,56","pdf_page_index":"54","thumbnail":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0054-0160/170673-1-eng-GB/f0054-012.jpg?t=tablet_story_thumbnail&ext/f0054-012_tablet_story_thumbnail.jpg","color":"FFFFFF","real_id":"17855","main_section_id":"534","ads":[]},{"id":"zinio_245_100340926_1494014992.3402","title":"Google combats fake news with ‘Fact Check’ results in search and news","sub_title":"","author":[{"id":"0","name":"","email":"noreply@audiencemedia.com","is_default":false}],"tag":"","strap_line":"CONSUMER WATCH","intro":"","body":"<p class=\"byline\"><b>BY IAN PAUL</b></p>\n<p>GOOGLE IS READY to roll out its fact check label (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/factchecklabel\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/factchecklabel</a>) to Google News editions worldwide after introducing the feature in October for the United States and the U.K. The label will also appear in searches in all languages that Google supports.</p>\n<p>When you’re searching for a topic that’s been answered by a source using the fact check label, Google’s results page will include a snippet with three components: information about the claim being made, who made the claim, and whether that claim is true, false, or somewhere in between.

If all that’s required is proper HTML markup, a site could try to get a fact check label for a false story. However, Google is willing to use its power as the world’s most popular search engine to counteract any shenanigans. The company’s support pages (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/gglfactck\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/gglfactck</a>) say that if a site does not meet Google’s standards for fact checking the search engine may ignore the publisher’s markup or remove the site from Google News.</p>\n<p>Another situation that users may confront is when two fact-check labels offer different conclusions. Google says this is possible under its new scheme. “There may be search result pages where different publishers checked the same claim and reached different conclusions,” Google said in a blog post. “We think it’s still helpful for people to understand the degree of consensus around a particular claim and have clear information on which sources agree.”</p>\n","layout":{},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":1,"link_source":"","competition":[],"flatplan_title":"","notes":"","gutter_credit":"","other":"","image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1494014993.7539","name":"f0057-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0057-0146/170709-1-eng-GB/f0057-012.jpg?t=default_ipad_portrait&ext/f0057-012_default_ipad_portrait.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"554","height":"1024","legacy_id":"17862","is_default":true},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1494014993.7539","name":"f0057-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0057-0146/170709-1-eng-GB/f0057-012.jpg?t=default_ipad_landscape&ext/f0057-012_default_ipad_landscape.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"415","height":"768","legacy_id":"17862","is_default":false}],"related_objects":{"image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_1_1494014992.4374","name":"f0058-01","source":"","caption":"<p><b>A fact check</b> snippet in Google search.</p>\n","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0058-0159/170702-1-eng-GB/f0058-012.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"726","height":"378","legacy_id":"17861"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_1_1494014992.4374","name":"f0058-01","source":"","caption":"<p><b>A fact check</b> snippet in Google search.</p>\n","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0058-0159/170702-1-eng-GB/f0058-012.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"726","height":"378","legacy_id":"17861"}]},"url_alias":"http://pcworld-us.audiencemedia.com","type":"story","order":"12","folio_number":"57","folio_numbers":"57,58","pdf_page_index":"57","thumbnail":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0057-0146/170709-1-eng-GB/f0057-012.jpg?t=tablet_story_thumbnail&ext/f0057-012_tablet_story_thumbnail.jpg","color":"FFFFFF","real_id":"17860","main_section_id":"534","ads":[]},{"id":"zinio_245_100340926_1494014994.9716","title":"LastPass password manager fixes serious password leak vulnerabilities","sub_title":"","author":[{"id":"0","name":"LUCIAN CONSTANTIN","email":"noreply@audiencemedia.com","is_default":false}],"tag":"","strap_line":"CONSUMER WATCH","intro":"","body":"<p class=\"byline\"><b>BY LUCIAN CONSTANTIN</b></p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0059-0146/170738-1-eng-GB/f0059-012.jpg\" width=\"873\" height=\"594\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0059-01\" title=\"f0059-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>DEVELOPERS OF THE popular LastPass password manager rushed to push out a fix to solve a serious vulnerability that could have allowed attackers to steal users’ passwords or execute malicious code on their computers.</p>\n<p>The vulnerability was discovered by Google security researcher Tavis Ormandy and was reported to LastPass. It affected the browser extensions installed by the service’s users for Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Microsoft Edge.</p>\n<p>According to a description in the Google Project Zero bug tracker, the vulnerability could have given attackers access to internal commands inside the LastPass extension. Those are the commands used by the extension to copy passwords or fill in web forms using information stored in the user’s secure vault.</p>\n<p>If the extension’s binary component is installed, the <b>openattach</b> command can be used to run arbitrary code on the computer, Ormandy said on the bug tracker.</p>\n<p>The LastPass developers deployed a workaround on their server to prevent exploitation and plan to include a full fix in new versions.</p>\n<p>Recently, Ormandy reported another vulnerability in the Firefox extension that, according to the LastPass developers, was related to the first one.

The company is yet again adding ads to Windows 10, but this time it’s in possibly the most egregious spot yet: File Explorer.</p>\n<p>Users have been complaining on Twitter and other online watering holes for a few days now. We haven’t seen the ads on our PCs yet, but Joel Hruska and Ryan Whitwam over at ExtremeTech (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/etmsads\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/etmsads</a>) apparently did.</p>\n<p>Right now, the only ad reported is for an Office 365 subscription, hidden in an offer to expand your OneDrive cloud storage space. It appears in a large tile area at the top of the File Explorer window with two buttons to either Learn More or to dismiss it with Not Now.</p>\n<p><b>The story behind the story:</b> While the new ads are surprising, really we should have seen this coming. In August, Microsoft rolled out Windows Insider Preview build 14901, which included a new “notifications” feature. Notifications appeared at the top of File Explorer—just as they do now for people getting hit with ads.
