Apple and Google have both built their AI aides deeply into their mobile operating systems, so Alexa has to live inside apps for now. On the iPhone it’s inside the Amazon shopping app (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/amzalxapp\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/amzalxapp</a>), and on the Mate 9 (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/alxmate9\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/alxmate9</a>, the only Android phone that supports it), it’s accessible via a dedicated Huawei Alexa app. So to use it, you’ll need to open the respective app before you can start asking questions.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0151-0127/171658-1-eng-GB/f0151-012.jpg\" width=\"873\" height=\"504\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0151-01\" title=\"f0151-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n <span class=\"credit\">\nIMAGE: CHRISTOPHER HEBERT</span></figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p class=\"pullQuote\">ALEXA HAS EXPANDED TO APPS, BUT THE ECHO EXPERIENCE STILL LOOMS LARGE.</p>\n<p>That’s a bit of an obstacle on phones that can already respond to our “Hey Siri” and “OK Google” voice commands, but in actuality it only takes a few seconds. And on the Mate 9, you can set a knuckle gesture to open the app a little quicker.</p>\n<p>You’ll also need to install the companion Amazon Alexa app and sign in with your Amazon account. Both versions of the app appear as separate devices with their own customizable settings, and anything you customize in your account (like your favorite sports teams or daily briefing) will be applied to all of them.</p>\n<p>Once the apps are open, you can’t just go asking questions, however. At least not on the iPhone. There you’ll still need to press the microphone icon to the right of the search bar to start your query. On the Mate 9, you can either press the center button or say Alexa, and it will respond. (Usually. On both the iPhone and the Mate 9, I experienced some audio issues when not holding the phone near my mouth.) While the Mate 9’s method is definitely better than the iPhone one, it’s still a far cry from the tremendous microphones built into the Echo and Dot.</p>\n<h3><b>Let’s talk</b></h3><p>Listening issues aside, Alexa on the Mate 9 and the iPhone can do a lot of the same things it does on the Echo. Both are able to shop for things at Amazon. Both can answer a wide array of general knowledge questions, from describing historical people and places, to conversions and sports factoids. They will also both tell you who won last night’s Warrior’s game (or game results for any other team or sport), as well as tell you who they’re playing next.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0152-0131/171651-1-eng-GB/f0152-012.jpg\" width=\"353\" height=\"627\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0152-01\" title=\"f0152-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div>\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0152-029/171644-1-eng-GB/f0152-022.jpg\" width=\"355\" height=\"627\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0152-02\" title=\"f0152-02\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>On the Huawei</b> Mate 9 (left), you can say “Alexa” to summon the assistant once the app is open, but on the iPhone version (right), you’ll need to press the microphone icon in the top right corner.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div>\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0153-0129/171637-1-eng-GB/f0153-012.jpg\" width=\"795\" height=\"448\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0153-01\" title=\"f0153-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n <span class=\"credit\">\nIMAGE: AMAZON</span></figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p class=\"pullQuote\">BUT WHILE IT SEEMS AS THOUGH ALEXA HAS BEEN TAILOR-MADE FOR A SMARTPHONE, THE EXPERIENCES HERE ARE HARDLY PERFECT.</p>\n<p>And Alexa’s quirky personality comes through too. Ask it to tell a joke, and it’ll happily oblige. (Unfortunately, the jokes are just as bad on the phones as they are on Echo.) And you can also play games like 20 Questions and Rock, Paper, Scissors, or have a little fun with the “Simon Says” mimic game where it repeats everything you say (within reason).</p>\n<p>But while it seems as though Alexa has been tailor-made for a smartphone, the experiences here are hardly perfect. While it will tell you the weather, it uses the location you have saved in the Alexa app (which can be different on each device), not your current location as determined by GPS. The same is true for traffic reports (it sticks to your preset daily commute), and there’s no way to access Google or Apple maps for turn-by-turn directions.</p>\n<h3><b>Falling short</b></h3><p>Things get weirder still when it comes to music and alarms, the most basic functions of any smartbot. The Mate 9 can’t play songs at all, but the iPhone can. So, if you subscribe to Amazon Prime Music or just have songs in your locker, you’ll be able to ask the Amazon shopping app to play something, but on the Mate 9, where it’s a marquee feature, it won’t oblige. And, you can’t set timers and alarms with either of the apps, which is a strange limitation.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0154-0124/171630-1-eng-GB/f0154-012.jpg\" width=\"873\" height=\"414\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0154-01\" title=\"f0154-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n <span class=\"credit\">\nIMAGE: IDG</span></figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p class=\"pullQuote\"><b>ALEXA DOESN’T DO ANYTHING SIRI OR GOOGLE ASSISTANT CAN’T DO ANYWAY, AND THE EXTRA EFFORT TO SUMMON IT WILL BE A DETERRENT FOR MOST PEOPLE.</b> IMAGE:</p>\n<p>So, clearly, there’s a long way to go. You’ll still need to purchase one of Amazon’s devices to get the full Alexa experience, and while the apps might technically get Alexa onto our phones, it’s not something most people are going to use all that often. Alexa doesn’t do anything Siri or Google Assistant can’t do anyway, and the extra effort to summon it will be a deterrent for most people.</p>\n<p>But all is not lost. While it’s unlikely that Alexa will be able to break free from its app confines on the iPhone, it could follow Cortana’s lead (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/corttalk\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/corttalk</a>) and offer a true lock-screen alternative to Google Assistant on Android phones, assuming Amazon replicates the Mate 9 functionality in the Play Store at some point.</p>\n<p>But without hooking up with all of Google’s services, it’s unlikely it will ever pose a serious threat to Google Assistant. What made Alexa a hit was its novel concept: an always-listening assistant in our homes. And that’s still the best place for it.</p>\n","layout":{},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":1,"link_source":"","competition":[],"flatplan_title":"","notes":"","gutter_credit":"","other":"","image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1494015103.7685","name":"f0149-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0149-0127/171672-1-eng-GB/f0149-012.jpg?t=default_ipad_portrait&ext/f0149-012_default_ipad_portrait.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"768","height":"1024","legacy_id":"17987","is_default":true},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1494015103.7685","name":"f0149-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0149-0127/171672-1-eng-GB/f0149-012.jpg?t=default_ipad_landscape&ext/f0149-012_default_ipad_landscape.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"576","height":"768","legacy_id":"17987","is_default":false}],"related_objects":{"image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_6_1494015097.4533","name":"f0154-01","source":"IMAGE:

No, I’m not talking about Windows 8. Dig deep into your memory, and you may recall a time when Windows 3.1 ruled Earth.</p>\n<p>Twenty-five years ago, Microsoft released version 3.1 of its MS-DOS graphical-shell-turned operating-system. Windows 3.1 became the first version of Windows to be widely distributed with new PCs, cementing the dominance of Microsoft’s OS on the IBM PC platform and signaling the dawn of the Golden Age of Windows.</p>\n<p>In honor of this anniversary, let’s take a visual tour through Windows 3.1. In the following pages, I’ll highlight many of the innovations this colorful GUI brought to Windows for the first time.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0158-0122/171792-1-eng-GB/f0158-012.jpg\" width=\"295\" height=\"241\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0158-01\" title=\"f0158-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div>\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0159-0125/171785-1-eng-GB/f0159-012.jpg\" width=\"731\" height=\"487\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0159-01\" title=\"f0159-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>PROGRAM MANAGER</b></h3><p>Before Windows Explorer, there was Program Manager, where you could group application icons together any way you wanted, allowing for primitive program organization. (For viewing files on your computer, you ran File Manager.) It worked well enough, but juggling the many windows could prove tricky—and you could end up with 50-plus program groups filling your screen.</p>\n<h3><b>FILE MANAGER</b></h3><p>File Manager let you explore the file system of your computer visually, using a directory tree and an icon-based view of files. Copying between folders was as easy as a drag and drop, which attracted many novice PC users to Windows. Microsoft combined File Manager and Program Manager into Windows Explorer in Windows 95, and the arrangement has been that way ever since.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0160-0125/171778-1-eng-GB/f0160-012.jpg\" width=\"731\" height=\"487\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0160-01\" title=\"f0160-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div>\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0161-0125/171771-1-eng-GB/f0161-012.jpg\" width=\"731\" height=\"487\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0161-01\" title=\"f0161-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>TRUETYPE FONTS</b></h3><p>The TrueType font system marked the most important visual innovation in Windows 3.1. TrueType was actually developed by Apple Computer, which—if you can believe it—licensed the technology to Microsoft for free. Why? Apple didn’t want Adobe to monopolize digital type.</p>\n<p>Rather than using blocky pixels in a bitmap, TrueType described fonts as curves and lines, which allowed fonts to scale smoothly to any size. This capability produced amazing printed documents, a big reason why Windows 3.1 flourished as a desktop publishing platform. Win 3.1 included 15 fonts with now-familiar names such as Arial, Courier, System, and Times New Roman.</p>\n<h3><b>BUILT-IN SCREENSAVERS</b></h3><p>Prior to Windows 3.1, if you wanted to save your monitor from CRT burn-in, you either turned it off or installed a third-party screensaver such as After Dark. In version 3.1, Microsoft included four screensavers: Blank Screen (oooh!), Flying Windows (assorted Windows logos soaring by), Marquee (a phrase of your choice scrolling across the screen), and Starfield Simulation (a flight through space, with the stars streaking past).</p>\n<p>Of course, users could install many more screensavers, which spawned a back-of-the-magazine cottage industry of screensaver plug-ins that functioned more as eye candy than as a genuine means to protect your monitor.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0162-0123/171764-1-eng-GB/f0162-012.jpg\" width=\"873\" height=\"446\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0162-01\" title=\"f0162-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div>\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0163-0125/171757-1-eng-GB/f0163-012.jpg\" width=\"731\" height=\"487\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0163-01\" title=\"f0163-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>MINESWEEPER AND SOLITAIRE</b></h3><p>In the days before easy and ubiquitous access to celebrity-news blogs, office workers often whiled away their idle hours with games of Solitaire and Minesweeper (well, that and doodling with Paintbrush). Solitaire first appeared in Windows 3.0, but Microsoft introduced the puzzle classic Minesweeper in 3.1, replacing 3.0’s Reversi. Some people claim that Windows Solitaire has wasted more hours of productivity than any other PC application.</p>\n<h3><b>THE REGISTRY IS BORN</b></h3><p>Windows 3.1 brought many improvements, but it also introduced a feature that would become the bane of many Windows users: the Registry. We all know how easy it is for this custom database of hidden system settings to become jumbled and wreak havoc on our machines. The Registry has survived all the complaints, though: Behind the modern-looking, Metro touch interface of Windows 8, the Registry still lurks.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0164-0122/171750-1-eng-GB/f0164-012.jpg\" width=\"731\" height=\"487\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0164-01\" title=\"f0164-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div>\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0165-0120/171743-1-eng-GB/f0165-012.jpg\" width=\"731\" height=\"487\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0165-01\" title=\"f0165-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>CONTROL PANEL</b></h3><p>Back in the days of 3.1, you needed only 12 icons in the Control Panel to configure all of Windows; in my Windows 7 Control Panel, I count 52 icons. (Of course, Windows 3.1 took up just 11MB of disk space, versus 23GB for my Windows 7 install—a good indication of the OS’s increasing complexity over the years.)</p>\n<p>Windows 3.1 was the first version of Windows to have a modular Control Panel. You could add new panels to the window shown here simply by copying a special CPL file into the Windows system folder.</p>\n<h3><b>EMBEDDED IMAGES</b></h3><p>Windows 3.1 introduced a systemwide means of embedding and linking different types of files together called OLE, short for Object Linking and Embedding. What does that mean? For example, you could take a Paintbrush bitmap file and embed it into a Write word processing file, as shown here. But if the bitmap were &quot;linked&quot; instead, any external changes in the bitmap would be reflected in the Write file. We take such functionality for granted these days, but 25 years ago this was a major convenience.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0166-0119/171736-1-eng-GB/f0166-012.jpg\" width=\"731\" height=\"487\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0166-01\" title=\"f0166-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div>\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0167-0122/171729-1-eng-GB/f0167-012.jpg\" width=\"731\" height=\"487\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0167-01\" title=\"f0167-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>UNIFORM OPEN/SAVE DIALOG BOXES</b></h3><p>Prior to Windows 3.1, application authors had to code their own Open/Save file dialog boxes from scratch for every program, which led to confusing inconsistencies. Microsoft remedied that in 3.1 by introducing a systemwide Open/Save dialog box system (shown here in Paintbrush) that developers could plug into their products.</p>\n<h3><b>MULTIMEDIA SUPPORT</b></h3><p>Microsoft first supported sound and video playback as part of Windows 3.0 with Multimedia Extensions, released in 1991, but only on new machines. The company made those additions standard in Windows 3.1, allowing users to play and record high-quality digitized audio files using sound cards such as the popular SoundBlaster Pro. And in Media Player, users could watch AVI video files—if their hardware could handle the video without choking.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0168-0124/171722-1-eng-GB/f0168-012.jpg\" width=\"731\" height=\"487\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0168-01\" title=\"f0168-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div>\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0169-0118/171715-1-eng-GB/f0169-012.jpg\" width=\"731\" height=\"487\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0169-01\" title=\"f0169-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>NOTEPAD ANDCALCULATOR</b></h3><p>Neither Notepad nor Calculator originated with Windows 3.1, but these often-used accessories are worth a look anyway. Though the appearance of Notepad should be familiar to most modern Windows users, the colorful, flat buttons of Calculator may seem a little strange. Those buttons are a vestige of the time before the shaded, 3D-button look of 1990’s Windows 3.0 became standard. Windows 95 introduced a more &quot;Windows-looking&quot; Calculator three years later.</p>\n<h3><b>TASK LIST</b></h3><p>In modern versions of Windows, you hold down Ctrl-Alt-Delete to access Task Manager. In Windows 3.1, you pressed Ctrl-Esc or double-clicked on the desktop to bring up the precursor of Task Manager, called Task List. The utility let you view all open applications and close one if it became unruly. (That wasn’t as useful as it sounds, though, since most application crashes at the time took Windows down with them.)</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0170-0119/171708-1-eng-GB/f0170-012.jpg\" width=\"731\" height=\"487\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0170-01\" title=\"f0170-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div>\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0171-0114/171701-1-eng-GB/f0171-012.jpg\" width=\"731\" height=\"487\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0171-01\" title=\"f0171-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>DIGITALDOODLES</b></h3><p>We’ll end our tour of 3.1 with an abstract illustration created by my brother in Paintbrush, the ancestor of today’s Paint.
