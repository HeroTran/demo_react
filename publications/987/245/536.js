Sometimes you have applications that use tabs to view multiple files in one window. For those that don’t, users often turn to Windows’ Snap function or multiple monitors.</p>\n<p>This tip uses a different solution by importing a longtime keyboard shortcut from the Mac, <b>Alt + `</b> (backtick). (The Mac version uses <b>Cmd</b> instead of <b>Alt</b>.) This simple keyboard shortcut, which you can easily hit with the same hand, automatically switches between multiple windows in the same program.</p>\n<p>You can accomplish something similar with Windows’ tried-and-true <b>Alt + Tab</b>, but that shortcut switches between every open window on your desktop.</p>\n<p>There are several programs that offer the backtick solution, but the one we’ll cover now is relatively new: Easy Windows Switcher (<a href=\"http://neosmart.net/EasySwitch\" target=\"_self\">neosmart.net/EasySwitch</a>) from NeoSmart Technologies.</p>\n<p>It’s a simple, behind-the-scenes program that’s only purpose is to allow you to hit <b>Alt + `</b> to switch between windows from the same desktop application.</p>\n<p>To install it, head over to the company’s site (link above) and download the EXE file. The site asks for your name and email before downloading, but handing that information over is not a requirement. Just hit the Download! button and you’ll be ready to go.</p>\n<p>Now click on the EXE file, and a properties window will open asking if you want to run Easy Windows Switcher for the current user session or to always have it run for the current user account. Choose whichever you prefer and that’s it. Open a program, hit <b>Alt + `</b> and you’ll be switching between open windows in no time.</p>\n<p>If Easy Windows Switcher isn’t for you, there’s also VistaSwitcher (go. <a href=\"http://pcworld.com/vistaswitcher\" target=\"_self\">pcworld.com/vistaswitcher</a>), a program we haven’t looked at since 2009 (it still works), but offers the backtick shortcut among other features.</p>\n","layout":{},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":1,"link_source":"","competition":[],"flatplan_title":"","notes":"","gutter_credit":"","other":"","image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1494015157.382","name":"f0203-01","source":"IMAGE: MICROSOFT","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0203-016/172133-1-eng-GB/f0203-012.jpg?t=default_ipad_portrait&ext/f0203-012_default_ipad_portrait.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"768","height":"562","legacy_id":"18046","is_default":true},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1494015157.382","name":"f0203-01","source":"IMAGE: MICROSOFT","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0203-016/172133-1-eng-GB/f0203-012.jpg?t=default_ipad_landscape&ext/f0203-012_default_ipad_landscape.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"1024","height":"750","legacy_id":"18046","is_default":false}],"related_objects":{"image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_1_1494015156.3905","name":"f0203-02","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0203-022/172126-1-eng-GB/f0203-022.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"873","height":"515","legacy_id":"18045"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_1_1494015156.3905","name":"f0203-02","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0203-022/172126-1-eng-GB/f0203-022.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"873","height":"515","legacy_id":"18045"}]},"url_alias":"http://pcworld-us.audiencemedia.com","type":"story","order":"29","folio_number":"203","folio_numbers":"203,204","pdf_page_index":"203","thumbnail":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0203-016/172133-1-eng-GB/f0203-012.jpg?t=tablet_story_thumbnail&ext/f0203-012_tablet_story_thumbnail.jpg","color":"FFFFFF","real_id":"18044","main_section_id":"536","ads":[]},{"id":"zinio_245_100340926_1494015158.6701","title":"4 ways to bolster your online privacy","sub_title":"","author":[{"id":"0","name":"JOSH NOREM","email":"noreply@audiencemedia.com","is_default":false}],"tag":"","strap_line":"HERE’S HOW","intro":"ANSWER LINE","body":"<p class=\"byline\"><b>BY JOSH NOREM</b></p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0205-015/172197-1-eng-GB/f0205-012.jpg\" width=\"110\" height=\"90\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0205-01\" title=\"f0205-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div>\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0205-023/172190-1-eng-GB/f0205-022.jpg\" width=\"873\" height=\"639\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0205-02\" title=\"f0205-02\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>EILEEN W. WROTE to me expressing concerns about online privacy, and though we’ve written about it previously (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/browserprivacy\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/browserprivacy</a>) I decided to add a few more tips and tricks for future readers. It is true you can never really be truly anonymous when browsing the web from any computer, but you can take several steps to make your browsing difficult to track and to make sure information you want to keep private isn’t being shared.</p>\n<h3><b>1. Use Tor</b></h3><p>If you want to make your online web browsing as difficult as humanly possible to track, use the Tor browser (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/torbundle\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/torbundle</a>) or hardware (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/anonabox\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/anonabox</a>) that connects you to the internet through Tor.</p>\n<p>Tor stands for The Onion Router, which is analogous to how it connects you to the internet (via several layers). Instead of just going from your home to whatever server is hosting the site you want to visit, the Tor network bounces your connection around the globe and encrypts each link, so in the end it will look like a computer in some faraway land is connecting to the site.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0206-016/172183-1-eng-GB/f0206-012.jpg\" width=\"519\" height=\"330\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0206-01\" title=\"f0206-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>How Tor works</b> - you’re connected to the web through a series of nodes, and each connection is encrypted.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div>\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0206-022/172176-1-eng-GB/f0206-022.jpg\" width=\"522\" height=\"216\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0206-02\" title=\"f0206-02\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>The Tor browser</b> shows you the nodes you are currently using along with their location.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>Though the feds have cracked this network previously, it’s still one of the best ways to cover your tracks when surfing online. The only caveat is all those connections bouncing around the globe take time, so it’s slower than a standard Internet connection.</p>\n<p>To use it just download, install, and use the Tor browser. If you want to use Google/Firefox/Edge or similar you’ll need to connect to Tor via hardware like the Anonabox. It’s also worth pointing out that downloading torrents (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/dltorrents\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/dltorrents</a>) over Tor is not supported, and exit nodes are set up to forbid file sharing.</p>\n<h3><b>2. Search with Duckduckgo or Startpage</b></h3><p>Every time you search with a regular search engine such as Google, Bing, or Yahoo, your results are recorded into a database, and the websites you visit from those results can see what you searched for as well. These two search engines— Duckduckgo (<a href=\"http://duckduckgo.com\" target=\"_self\">duckduckgo.com</a>) and Startpage (<a href=\"http://startpage.com\" target=\"_self\">startpage.com</a>)—are trying to put an end to this situation by keeping all your searches private.</p>\n<p>The only caveat is that Duckduckgo is based in the United States, so if you’re afraid the NSA or another government authority will find their way in someday, that's a consideration. I can’t tell where Startpage is located. Its holding company is in the Netherlands and it lists a European privacy award on its website (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/startpageprivacy\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/startpageprivacy</a>), so it appears to be based in Europe and thus theoretically out of the reach of U.S. agencies.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0207-014/172169-1-eng-GB/f0207-012.jpg\" width=\"370\" height=\"498\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0207-01\" title=\"f0207-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>Opera 40 has</b> a free, built-in VPN service that offers unlimited data.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>3. Use a VPN</b></h3><p>If you don’t want to hassle with the slowness of Tor, you can always use a VPN (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/vpnweb\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/vpnweb</a>), which stands for Virtual Private Network. This essentially means you connect to another computer somewhere in the world, and that computer connects you to the web, so sites can’t see that it’s you who's connecting to their server.</p>\n<p>The VPN services will see your IP address when you connect, obviously, but they typically don’t hold onto the data for very long and often will scrub their databases regularly, but it depends on the service you use. When evaluating a VPN just be sure to check out its privacy policy first, as it will spell out in great detail how it handles customer information. It’s not bulletproof, but much more secure in terms of privacy than most common measures, such as incognito mode on your browser.</p>\n<p>You can use Tor with a VPN if you really want to go underground. VPNs are also great workarounds for accessing content that isn’t allowed in your country. It’s worth pointing out that the web browser Opera 40 (<a href=\"http://opera.com\" target=\"_self\">opera.com</a>) includes a free built-in VPN with unlimited data.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0208-016/172162-1-eng-GB/f0208-012.jpg\" width=\"397\" height=\"318\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0208-01\" title=\"f0208-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>The various sections</b> of Google’s Privacy checkup - better get some coffee before starting.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>4. Configure your Google privacy settings</b></h3><p>Even though Google recently announced an opt-out program for those who don’t want data collected on them, for most of us it just simply isn’t an option. It’s also a safe bet that many of you reading this use at least one, if not more of its services like Gmail, Google Maps, Android OS on your phone, Google Search, YouTube, and so forth. The company collects a vast amount of data and spreads it all over its services, so it’s worth it to take a few moments to make sure your settings for all its services are how you want them. Thankfully Google walks you through the whole process step-by-step (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/googleprivacy\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/googleprivacy</a>, you should be signed into Google first).</p>\n<p class=\"pullQuote\">What are your favorite commands?
