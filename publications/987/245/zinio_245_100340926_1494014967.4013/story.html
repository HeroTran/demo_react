<p>IT LOOKS LIKE we can’t jokingly call the Pascal GPU-based Titan X the “Titan XP” anymore, because Nvidia just rolled out a new version of its flagship graphics card that’s officially dubbed “Titan Xp.” And this thing is a monster.</p>
<p>The original $1,200 Pascal-based Titan X shattered performance records, but the recently released GeForce GTX 1080 Ti rendered it obsolete, offering slightly faster performance for just $700 as Nvidia prepares for Radeon Vega’s imminent release.</p>

    </div><p>The Titan Xp (<a href="http://go.pcworld.com/titanxpprod" target="_self">go.pcworld.com/titanxpprod</a>) restores natural balance to Nvidia’s lineup by upping CUDA cores and clock speeds. Whereas the original Titan X Pascal (and the GTX 1080 Ti) packed 3,584 CUDA cores, the new version upgrades to a full-fat version of Nvidia’s GP102 graphics processor, with 3,840 cores. Those cores are faster, too, with a boost clock of 1,582MHz compared to the Titan X’s 1,531MHz.</p>

    </div><p>The Titan’s already speedy GDDR5X memory is enhanced in the Titan Xp as well, hitting 11.4Gbps—a 1.4Gbps boost over its predecessor. That gives Nvidia’s new flagship a whopping 547.7GBps of memory bandwidth. The original Titan X hits 480GBps, and mainstream graphics cards hover in the 200GBps to 250GBps range.</p>
<p>Even though Nvidia’s beefed up the Titan’s potency, it still sticks to the same physical dimensions and power requirements as the initial Titan X Pascal, snazzy black shroud and all.</p>
<p>One more notable inclusion: macOS support, mere days after Apple teased the world with promises of an upgraded Mac Pro. Look for beta drivers to launch later in April. Nvidia told <i>9to5 Mac</i> that those beta drivers will enable Mac support for <i>all</i> GTX 10-series graphics cards, not just the new Titan Xp.</p>
<p>The impact on you at home: Again—this thing’s a monster. We haven’t tested the card but the Titan Xp should easily eclipse the GTX 1080 Ti in pure gaming performance. That said, Nvidia’s new behemoth sticks to the same $1,200 asking price as the Titan X Pascal, so gamers who want top-of-the-line graphics performance at a high, but not outright ludicrous, price will probably want to stick with the GTX 1080 Ti.</p>
