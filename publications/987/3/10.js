I tried to compare the updated ThinkPad X1 Carbon with Broadwell to the Haswell ThinkPad Carbon X1, for instance, but it wasn’t quite applesto-apples. I initially determined that the Broadwell CPU was significantly faster than the Haswell. Something didn’t ring right, though, and ultimately I decided Lenovo’s redesign of the laptop likely contributed to the results and really made it useless to try to draw any conclusion on the CPUs themselves.</p>\n<p>My second chance came when I found upon two laptops that were identical—save for the CPU. Dell’s commercial Latitude E5250 at one point simultaneously shipped with Haswell and Broadwell parts.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0125-012/3856-1-eng-GB/f0125-012.jpg\" width=\"587\" height=\"473\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0125-01\" title=\"f0125-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>The Dell Latitude</b> E5250, at one point, came in both Haswell and Broadwell trim, making it perfect for testing.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>THE COMPETITORS</b></h3><p>The chips are very close. The Haswell-based E5250 uses an Intel Core i5-4310U, a dual-core chip with Hyper-Threading and a rated clock speed from 2GHz to 3GHz. The Broadwell-based E5250 has a Core i5-5200U that’s also a dual-core with Hyper-Threading and ranges from 2.2GHz to 2.7GHz. While the Broadwell’s base clock speed is a little higher, its top speed is a bit lower. Perhaps more importantly, both CPUs are also the same price.</p>\n<p>For graphics, the Broadwell has Intel HD 5500, while the Haswell has Intel HD 4400 graphics. If you want to see more details of the two CPU competitors, I’ve lined them up at Intel’s ARK site (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/ark\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/ark</a>).</p>\n<p>Everything else, from what I can tell, is the same. Both feature touch-panel, 1920 x 1080-resolution displays, 256GB Samsung mSATA PM851 mSATA drives, 8GB of DDR3L RAM in singlechannel mode, the same 51-watt-hour capacity batteries, and the same Windows 8.1 OS. In fact, both even use the same motherboard, which I visually confirmed by opening up both E5250 laptops. The only difference in the motherboard is one has a Haswell soldered down to it, while the other has a Broadwell soldered down to it. This is no surprise: Intel designed the Broadwell to be “drop-in” compatible, and many makers did just that.</p>\n<p class=\"pullQuote\">Single-threaded performance is very close—but surprise, the Haswell chip wins here.</p>\n<h3><b>THE TESTS</b></h3><p>For benchmarks, I stuck with tests that would isolate the CPU performance as much as possible. First up is the pure CPU benchmark Cinebench R15, which measures a chip’s performance rendering 3D. The performance, for the most part, is very close—but surprise, the Haswell chip actually wins here. I suspect that’s because the singlethreaded mode gives the Haswell chip a small advantage due to its higher clock speed when on Turbo Boost mode. The Broadwell tops out at 2.7GHz versus the 3GHz of the Haswell chip’s top speed. That gives the Haswell chip about a 10 percent clock speed advantage.</p>\n<p>The good news for Broadwell is that its improvements in performance close the clock speed gap. Despite that roughly 10 percent clock speed difference between the two, the actual performance gap in Cinebench R15 is closer to 5 percent.</p>\n<h3><b>CINEBENCH 3D RENDERING PERFORMANCE</b></h3><p>What happens when you run CineBench R15 in multi-threaded mode, though, where it measures the overall performance of all the cores in a CPU? We see the Broadwell come back to edge out the Haswell chip. This is because, while the Broadwell chip is slower in overall clock speed when only one core is working, it runs a little cooler (thanks to its 14nm process). The Haswell has an advantage in the beginning, but as it heats up, it starts to throttle back on frequency so it’s only about 100MHz faster by the end of the test. Combined with the better efficiency of Broadwell, it’s just enough to make the 5th-gen chip barely faster here.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0127-012/3849-1-eng-GB/f0127-012.jpg\" width=\"591\" height=\"327\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0127-01\" title=\"f0127-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>Cinebench R15</b> in singlethreaded mode measures CPU performance and isolates just one core.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div>\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0127-02/3842-1-eng-GB/f0127-022.jpg\" width=\"591\" height=\"322\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0127-02\" title=\"f0127-02\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>Despite being slower</b> on single-threaded tasks than the Haswell chip, the Broadwell makes up for it in multithreaded performance.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div>\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0128-012/3835-1-eng-GB/f0128-012.jpg\" width=\"591\" height=\"342\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0128-01\" title=\"f0128-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>In general workloads</b>, the higher clock speeds of the Haswell give it a slight advantage.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>PCMARK 8 OFFICE PERFORMANCE</b></h3><p>I also ran PCMark 8’s Work test using the conventional setting. This keeps the workload to the CPU side instead of using a little of the graphics core for some tasks. PCMark 8 Work test is designed to simulate tasks such as videoconferencing and general-office droning.</p>\n<p>PCMark 8’s not heavily multi-threaded like CineBench and doesn’t heat up the Haswell enough to make throttling a big problem. The Haswell CPU’s slightly higher clock speed gives it the advantage here, but for the most part it’s not enough to write home about. It’s actually a fairly realistic evaluation of the low demands of mundane office tasks: The dual-core Haswell laptop scores 2,922. Consider that a tested desktop (not shown here) with a six-core Core i7-5820K scored 3,321. That tells me PCMark 8’s right on the mark for office tasks and you don’t need that many cores for office work.</p>\n<h3><b>HANDBRAKE ENCODING PERFORMANCE</b></h3><p>Looking for a heavier-duty task, I also threw in our standard encoding test, where we take a 30GB, 1080p MKV file and use Handbrake to transcode, using the Android for Tablet profile. On dual-core machines, it takes in excess of two hours to complete.</p>\n<p>This test gives us two really useful data points. The first is how well a particular CPU performs in this heavily multi-threaded test. Short of an 18-core CPU with 1080p resolution files, it’ll max out all cores.</p>\n<p>The second data point you get from this test is how much the design of a laptop suffers from thermal throttling. Modern CPUs are designed to slow down when they get too hot or if the PC maker determines it’s heating up the entire laptop too much. For example, if you look at the Handbrake test in my recent review of the Lenovo LaVie Z (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/lavie\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/lavie</a>), you can see how much certain PC designs will throttle back the CPU’s speed—the review’s Handbrake chart shows the impact of thermal throttling from the Surface Pro 3 and the Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon, both of which have the same CPU. If you look at the result from the HP Spectre x360 and compare it to the Dell XPS 13 that has the same CPU, you also see the performance drop off to aid and abet the cooling capability of the laptop (or the decision by the laptop maker not to heat it up too much).</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0129-012/3828-1-eng-GB/f0129-012.jpg\" width=\"591\" height=\"342\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0129-01\" title=\"f0129-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>In our Handbrake</b> task, the older Haswell and the newer Broadwell are almost dead even.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div>\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0130-012/3821-1-eng-GB/f0130-012.jpg\" width=\"591\" height=\"342\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0130-01\" title=\"f0130-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>Broadwell features</b> an improved graphics core over Haswell and that shows up here.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>With all that said, let’s now look at the results from the Broadwell and Haswell units. Both use the exact same cooling system, from what I could tell looking inside both. The Broadwell technically loses here, by less than 1 percent. But when you remember that the Haswell technically has the higher clock speed, it’s actually a win for the Broadwell to be so close.</p>\n<h3><b>3DMARK GRAPHICS PERFORMANCE</b></h3><p>While Intel says Haswell-to-Broadwell performance shows maybe a 5 percent difference on CPU functions, on graphics the company says the spread’s more significant. That shows up in 3DMark, where the Broadwell-chipped Dell offers up about 10 percent more graphics performance in Cloudgate. I even saw a 15 percent difference between the two when the graphics load is scaled back further to 3DMark Ice Storm Extreme. Don’t fool yourself—you won’t be playing <i>Batman: Arkham Knight</i> at 4K with either CPU, nor any recent graphicsintensive game, but a game of <i>Minecraft</i>, <i>Counter Strike,</i> or <i>Portal 2</i> with the settings turned down enough are playable.</p>\n<p>My last benchmark chart for the mobile dual-cores is the most important one for the applications in an ultra-portable laptop. Let’s be realistic: People aren’t encoding 4K video or playing <i>Battlefield 4</i> on these laptops, they’re pushing browsers, Office, and maybe Photoshop, or coding on them. All within the performance envelope of a dual-core processor. What people care about most is the battery life.</p>\n<p>MobileMark 2014’s Office Productivity battery test uses common applications such as Word, Acrobat, and Chrome to simulate a day of pushing mundane office tasks while on a battery. The test even lets the laptop go to sleep for a few minutes, when the typical office drone might be checking their phone or chatting to the person in the next airplane seat.</p>\n<p>Here we see the 14nm Broadwell CPU pay off very healthy dividends over the 22nm Haswell CPU. Remember, both laptops use the exact same-capacity battery, SSD, OS, and just about everything else. For the record, the RAM chips were different, as were the battery makers, but they used the same specifications.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0131-012/3814-1-eng-GB/f0131-012.jpg\" width=\"591\" height=\"365\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0131-01\" title=\"f0131-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>Here’s the one</b> that matters: Broadwell is indeed better at battery life than Haswell but probably not enough to make you jump ship.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>With all things being equal, a 10 percent improvement in battery life is significant when you consider that Haswell was already an outstanding performer. Haswell significantly moved the ball forward over Intel’s 3rd-generation Ivy Bridge CPU. Matt Smith actually did a somewhat similar test (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/smith\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/smith</a>), pitting an Ivy Bridge laptop against a Haswell laptop. Both laptops were similar, but Haswell CPUs required a wealth of new components such as chipset and voltage changes, so comparisons don’t really isolate just the CPU.</p>\n<p>I’m fairly certain that if the laptops used here had CPU sockets and I could switch the chips, my results would be the same.</p>\n<h3><b>CONCLUSION</b></h3><p>Broadwell cuts both ways. Broadwell is better than Haswell by 5 percent to 10 percent or so on a given task when the CPU models are exactly the same. Battery life is better by 10 percent or so. Graphics performance is much improved, but it’s still just integrated graphics, best suited for office dronage or low-ambition gaming.</p>\n<p>If you were to buy a laptop today, Broadwell is the way to go—if your options are between a Broadwell-based CPU and a Haswell-based one at the same price.</p>\n<p>If you have a Haswell-based laptop, however, there’s no point in upgrading to Broadwell. I don’t expect that many people who bought a Haswell-based laptop in 2014 are deciding to upgrade to one with a Broadwell CPU a year later just for the CPU. They might upgrade for pen support, a better screen, or a larger SSD or keyboard, however.</p>\n<p>This information is really aimed at those using even older, 2nd-generation Sandy Bridge CPUs or 3rd-generation Ivy Bridge CPUs. Moving to a modern Broadwell laptop would deliver significant improvement in battery life and clock-for-clock performance, not to mention all of the other advances in screen quality, touch, and SSD support. For those replacing an older laptop, Broadwell is the better CPU, and our tests prove it.</p>\n","layout":{"landscape":{"id":"am-landscape-9","link":"news_article-l.twig"},"portrait":{"id":"am-portrait-9","link":"news_article.twig"}},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":0,"link_source":"","competition":[],"flatplan_title":"","notes":"","gutter_credit":"","other":"","image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1439381055.7948","name":"f0124-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0124-012/3863-1-eng-GB/f0124-012_story_img_size_768x0.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"783","height":"768","legacy_id":"516","is_default":true},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1439381055.7948","name":"f0124-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0124-012/3863-1-eng-GB/f0124-012_story_img_size_768x0.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"783","height":"768","legacy_id":"516","is_default":false}],"related_objects":{"image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_7_1439381051.2538","name":"f0131-01","source":"","caption":"<p><b>Here’s

greatest inventions of the last few decades. Thanks to Wi-Fi every device in your home can easily get online, whether it’s your iPad, desktop PC, the high-definition television in the living room, and maybe even your coffee pot or fridge.</p>\n<p>But are you getting the most out of your wireless Internet connection? Is it truly as fast as your service provider claims? Are the neighbors screwing up your signal? Do you know how to connect all your various devices together to share files at home?</p>\n<h3><b>Wi-Fi made more wonderful</b></h3><p>Here are five free Wi-Fi-enhancing tools that can help you answer “yes” to all of those questions.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0136-012/3920-1-eng-GB/f0136-012.jpg\" width=\"673\" height=\"379\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0136-01\" title=\"f0136-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>1. Channel changers</b></h3><p>Sometimes getting a better Wi-Fi signal is as simple as changing the channel. If you live in a densely populated area such as an apartment or townhouse complex, you are probably surrounded by dozens or even hundreds of individual Wi-Fi routers. Each one is broadcasting a signal to help its owner get online. The problem is that sometimes a bunch of closely situated routers can end up interfering with each other.</p>\n<p>When that happens you can help yourself out by changing your router’s broadcast channel. To help you find an ideal channel (read: the least populated) use ViStumbler (<a href=\"http://vistumbler.net\" target=\"_self\">vistumbler.net</a>) on Windows to get all kinds of data on the Wi-Fi routers around you. Or you could give Wifi Analyzer (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/wifianalyzer\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/wifianalyzer</a>) for Android a try—this is also a great option to test signal strength at different points in your house.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0137-012/3913-1-eng-GB/f0137-012.jpg\" width=\"679\" height=\"428\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0137-01\" title=\"f0137-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>2. Speed test</b></h3><p>The golden rule of Wi-Fi service is to never believe the speed promises your Internet Service Provider makes, at least not without checking. That’s where Ookla’s <a href=\"http://speedtest.net\" target=\"_self\">Speedtest.net</a> (<a href=\"http://speedtest.net\" target=\"_self\">speedtest.net</a>) comes in. This simple service quickly checks your network speeds in an easy to understand format that highlights your download and upload speeds.</p>\n<p>There are also mobile apps for Android, iOS, and Windows Phone, which is handy when you want to quickly check out your hotel Wi-Fi speeds, or even what kind of speeds you can get in the attic.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0138-012/3906-1-eng-GB/f0138-012.jpg\" width=\"477\" height=\"276\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0138-01\" title=\"f0138-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>3. Transform your PC into a hotspot</b></h3><p>It’s easy to let your phone or tablet become a Wi-Fi hotspot that other devices can connect to, since most modern mobile operating systems come with a one-click solution to make this happen. Your laptop or desktop PC, however, does not. There are built-in methods for various builds of Windows, but they are either a little complicated or involve jumping onto the command line. (Ugh.)</p>\n<p>To get around this there are many third-party apps you can download to make your PC a hotspot, including Connectify (<a href=\"http://connectify.me\" target=\"_self\">connectify.me</a>), MyPublicWiFi (<a href=\"http://mypublicwifi.com\" target=\"_self\">mypublicwifi.com</a>), and Virtual Router (virtualrouter. <a href=\"http://codeplex.com\" target=\"_self\">codeplex.com</a>).</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0139-012/3899-1-eng-GB/f0139-012.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"533\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0139-01\" title=\"f0139-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>4. Chrome Connectivity Diagnostics</b></h3><p>So you’ve tried changing channels, but you’re still having issues with your Wi-Fi. Google has a Chrome app that can help called Chrome Connectivity Diagnostics (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/chromeconnectdiag\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/chromeconnectdiag</a>). This app runs a number of tests on your laptop’s current Wi-Fi connection to determine whether you have an Internet connection available to you, a DNS connec tion, and the right ports open on your laptop, and then it runs a bunch of checks with Google products.</p>\n<p>If there are any issues you’ll see them at the top of your window under a heading called Warning Tests<i>.</i> As you can see, my network was having issues one day with a slow connection. Click the problem and you get a summary of what’s going on. There are also some Chrome OS– only features including Wi-Fi network strength and whether your default gateway is reachable.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0140-012/3892-1-eng-GB/f0140-012.jpg\" width=\"616\" height=\"490\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0140-01\" title=\"f0140-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>5. Transfer files</b></h3><p>Part of the beauty of Wi-Fi is that you have a variety of devices all over the house and they are all connected to the same network. Getting those devices to talk to each other, however, is not so simple—unless you know about the right software to use.</p>\n<p>The simplest option for PCs is just to use the Windows HomeGroup (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/win7homegroup\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/win7homegroup</a>) feature first introduced in Windows 7. This will let you share printers, music, videos, and documents. For mobile devices, tools like AirDroid (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/airdrodmirroring\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/airdrodmirroring</a>), Pushbullet (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/pushbulletportal\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/pushbulletportal</a>), and Dooblou WiFi File Explorer (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/dooblouwifi\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/dooblouwifi</a>) can help move data to a PC. Finally, if you want to keep a folder or set of folders in sync, then your best option is BitTorrent Sync (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/bittorrentsync\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/bittorrentsync</a>).</p>\n<p>Some of these tools don’t necessarily require you to be on the same network, but things tend to go faster when they are.</p>\n","layout":{"landscape":{"id":"am-landscape-14","link":"news_secondary_02-l.twig"},"portrait":{"id":"am-portrait-14","link":"news_secondary_02.twig"}},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":0,"link_source":"","competition":[],"flatplan_title":"","notes":"","gutter_credit":"","other":"","image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1439381060.4766","name":"f0134-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0134-012/3927-1-eng-GB/f0134-012_story_img_size_768x0.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"969","height":"768","legacy_id":"524","is_default":true},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1439381060.4766","name":"f0134-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0134-012/3927-1-eng-GB/f0134-012_story_img_size_768x0.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"969","height":"768","legacy_id":"524","is_default":false}],"related_objects":{"image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_5_1439381057.4945","name":"f0140-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0140-012/3892-1-eng-GB/f0140-012.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"616","height":"490","legacy_id":"519"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_5_1439381057.4945","name":"f0140-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0140-012/3892-1-eng-GB/f0140-012.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"616","height":"490","legacy_id":"519"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_4_1439381058.0697","name":"f0139-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0139-012/3899-1-eng-GB/f0139-012.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"600","height":"533","legacy_id":"520"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_4_1439381058.0697","name":"f0139-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0139-012/3899-1-eng-GB/f0139-012.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"600","height":"533","legacy_id":"520"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_3_1439381058.6823","name":"f0138-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0138-012/3906-1-eng-GB/f0138-012.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"477","height":"276","legacy_id":"521"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_3_1439381058.6823","name":"f0138-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0138-012/3906-1-eng-GB/f0138-012.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"477","height":"276","legacy_id":"521"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_2_1439381059.2423","name":"f0137-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0137-012/3913-1-eng-GB/f0137-012.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"679","height":"428","legacy_id":"522"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_2_1439381059.2423","name":"f0137-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0137-012/3913-1-eng-GB/f0137-012.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"679","height":"428","legacy_id":"522"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_1_1439381059.8622","name":"f0136-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0136-012/3920-1-eng-GB/f0136-012.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"673","height":"379","legacy_id":"523"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_1_1439381059.8622","name":"f0136-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0136-012/3920-1-eng-GB/f0136-012.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"673","height":"379","legacy_id":"523"}]},"url_alias":"http://pcworld-us.audiencemedia.com","type":"story","order":"20","folio_number":"134","folio_numbers":"134,135,136,137,138,139","pdf_page_index":"134","thumbnail":"http://pcworld-us.audiencemedia.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0134-012/3927-1-eng-GB/f0134-012_tablet_story_thumbnail.jpg","color":"FFFFFF","real_id":"518","main_section_id":"10","ads":[]},{"id":"zinio_
