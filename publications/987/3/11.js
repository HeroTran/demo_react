If you’re new to Labs, it’s the testing ground for Gmail’s more experimental features. The successful ones go on to become standard Gmail capabilities—the much-loved Send &amp; Archive button was once a Gmail Lab experiment—but while they’re in the Labs, there’s always the outside chance they could break, change, or disappear</p>\n<p>To enable any Gmail Lab feature, click the gear icon in the top left of the Gmail pane. Go to Settings → Labs. Scroll down to the feature you want, select the Enable radio button, and click Save Changes. Should you run into trouble using any of these, you can get to your email by going to <a href=\"https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/?labs=0\" target=\"_self\">https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/?labs=0</a>, which disables these features so you can reach your inbox.</p>\n<p>Assuming you’re comfortable being Gmail’s guinea pig, here are four Google Labs features you should experiment with yourself.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0145-01/3977-1-eng-GB/f0145-012.jpg\" width=\"591\" height=\"385\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0145-01\" title=\"f0145-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>Gmail Labs</b> calls its features “some crazy experimental stuff.”</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>Undo Send</b></h3><p>Whether it was a simple snarky remark or a seething message, we’ve all felt the pang of regret after sending an email we probably shouldn’t have. If you just can’t control your impulses, Gmail’s Undo Send feature can save you from having to eat a heaping helping of humble pie.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0146-012/3970-1-eng-GB/f0146-012.jpg\" width=\"592\" height=\"48\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0146-01\" title=\"f0146-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>Once you</b> enable Undo Send, configure your cancellation period on the General Settings tab.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>This feature will delay sending your email messages 5, 10, 20, or 30 seconds, giving you a grace period during which you can hit an Undo button and prevent your missive from going out. Once you’ve enabled it, just set your Cancellation Period on the General tab under Settings.</p>\n<h3><b>Canned Responses</b></h3><p>We all have certain email replies that we send over and over—“busy” responses, receipt confirmations, and away messages, for example. Google Labs Canned Responses lets you pre-write and save these evergreen messages so you can send them with one click.</p>\n<p>Once you’ve enabled this feature, creating a canned response is simple. From your inbox, click Compose, and type a reply you want to save. Next, click the arrow in the lower right corner of the message window and select Canned Responses → New Canned Response. Name the response, and click OK. When you want to use a canned response, click the arrow again from the message you’re replying to, and select Canned Response, then the name of the one you want to insert.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0146-02/3963-1-eng-GB/f0146-022.jpg\" width=\"591\" height=\"262\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0146-02\" title=\"f0146-02\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>Canned Responses</b> lets you insert common replies with one click.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div>\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0147-01/3956-1-eng-GB/f0147-012.jpg\" width=\"592\" height=\"317\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0147-01\" title=\"f0147-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>Preview Pane</b> lets you view messages as you browse your inbox.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>Preview Pane</b></h3><p>One downside to Gmail is you have to open a message to see its contents, which is a time suck when you’re trying to browse through your inbox. Preview Pane gives Gmail’s web interface the multipane view we’ve become accustomed to on most desktop email clients, and let’s you view messages as you scroll through them.</p>\n<p>When you enable this feature, a new button will appear next to the gear icon in your inbox. From here you can toggle Preview Pane on and off and select either a vertical or horizontal orientation.</p>\n<h3><b>Auto-advance</b></h3><p>If you’re processing your emails in bulk at designated times rather than as they arrive—as you should be—you know it’s a drag to have to return to your inbox after handling each message to select the next one. Auto-advance saves you time by automatically moving to the next oldest message (if you process your inbox from the top down) or next newest (if you process from bottom up). You can configure your preference on the General tab under Settings.</p>\n","layout":{"landscape":{"id":"am-landscape-2","link":"hh_article_02-l.twig"},"portrait":{"id":"am-portrait-2","link":"hh_article_02.twig"}},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":0,"link_source":"","competition":[],"flatplan_title":"","notes":"","gutter_credit":"","other":"","image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1439381064.0639","name":"f0144-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0144-012/3984-1-eng-GB/f0144-012_story_img_size_768x0.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"664","height":"768","legacy_id":"531","is_default":true},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1439381064.0639","name":"f0144-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0144-012/3984-1-eng-GB/f0144-012_story_img_size_768x0.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"664","height":"768","legacy_id":"531","is_default":false}],"related_objects":{"image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_4_1439381061.7327","name":"f0147-01","source":"","caption":"<p><b>Preview

People ask this question all the time. The answer is “almost anything.” Excel has evolved into one of the most versatile programs available. In addition to spreadsheets that calculate everything, it’s also a database, a programming tool, a graphics program with charts, tables, drawing tools, photos, clipart, and even layout abilities, and it’s a limited, but functioning, word processor (with a spell checker, Thesaurus, grammar tools, research capabilities, translation functions, and more).</p>\n<p>With its graphic features, you can create anything from a detailed drawing to an edited photo. You can make calendars, note pads, list pads, schedules, grid/graph paper, greeting cards, business cards, etc. If you’re wondering why anyone would use Excel over programs such as Photoshop and/or Illustrator, the answer is simple. Not everyone has access to graphics and/or photoediting software. And, although Windows includes PC Paint as an Accessory program, it’s actually easier—in many cases—to use Excel for some projects. .</p>\n<p class=\"pullQuote\">With Excel’s graphic features, you can create anything from a detailed drawing to an edited photo.</p>\n<h3><b>How to start your calendar</b></h3><p>Open a blank worksheet. Highlight Columns A through G, then roll your cursor down to extend the highlight through Row 7, making the range A1 through G7. From the Home tab, select the Cells group, and click Format → Column Width. Type 18 in the Column Width dialog box, then click OK. With the range still highlighted, select the Cells group, and click Format → Row Height. Type 75 in the Row Height dialog box, and click OK. Move your cursor to the Home position, A1. Change the Row Height to 118. Cursor down to A2 and change the Row Height to 30.</p>\n<p>Highlight the range A1 through G7 again. Select the Page Layout tab, choose Orientation from the Page Setup group, and click Landscape. Next, click Margins from the same tab and group, and select Custom Margins from the list. The Margins tab in the Page Setup window appears. Press the Tab key once, and your cursor moves to the first setting: Top.</p>\n<p><b>TIP:</b> It’s so much easier and faster to just tab and type through these settings, rather than trying to highlight each field box and cursor the up/down arrows.</p>\n<p>In the Top field box, type .25, then press the Tab key and your cursor moves to Bottom. Enter .25, press the Tab key, cursor moves to the Left field box. Enter .25, Tab to the Right field box, enter .25. Press the Tab key, cursor moves up to Header, enter 0. Then tab again down to Footer, and enter 0. Press Tab again, and the cursor moves to the Center on Page panel. Check both Horizontally and Vertically, then click OK.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0150-012/4055-1-eng-GB/f0150-012.jpg\" width=\"592\" height=\"630\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0150-01\" title=\"f0150-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>1.

It looks like nothing happened, but press the Home key once, and notice the solid (or dotted) line around the area you just selected. This is the area of your spreadsheet that Excel prints, as long as you don’t change the Print Area to something else. Highlight a new area: A2 through G7. Click the Borders button in the Fonts group, under the Home tab, then choose All Borders from the drop-down list.</p>\n<p>Enter the days of the week in Row 2 (A2:G2), center horizontally and vertically, then enter the days of the current month on the calendar. Next, merge the top cells into one. Highlight Row A1 through G1, then select Merge &amp; Center from the Merge button under the Home tab, Alignment group. Now, let’s add a fancy title (June 2015). Click Insert → Text → WordArt and choose a style for your text , then type June 2015 in the field box.</p>\n<p>If you’d prefer a more ornate month and year, try some clipart. Delete the WordArt, then select Insert → Illustrations → Online Pictures, and type June in the search box. Choose an image for the title, then size to fit. Next, add some clipart images to decorate your calendar. Select Insert → Illustrations → Online Pictures again, type Summer in the search box, then choose from the filtered selection. Size to fit in the space provided.

The background is transparent, the wrong year is cropped out, and it’s sized to fit in the header space above your calendar.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0154-012/4027-1-eng-GB/f0154-012.jpg\" width=\"448\" height=\"797\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0154-01\" title=\"f0154-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>5.

To add text to a date, position your cursor on the target date; for example, June 12th. Press the function key F2 to edit this cell. The cursor positions to the right of the number 12. Because the numbers are on the bottom-right corner—unless you want to change that— press the Home key to reposition the cursor before the day.</p>\n<p>Now type the name of the occasion, then press Alt+Enter (hold down the Alt key, then press the Enter key, then release both keys), once for each additional line added—in this case, once to separate the text from the number, then three more times to move the text to the top of the calendar box. Now the data is on the right. No problem, just click the Align Right button on the Home tab, Alignment group and the data moves to the right.</p>\n<p>Note: You cannot rightjustify the number, then center or left-justify the text, because Excel doesn’t allow multiple paragraph styles in the same cell. You can click the Increase Indent button (also in the Alignment group) to move the data two pixels away from the right border. But you can use multiple font attributes such as Bold for the number and Italics or a different color for the text. Press F2 to edit, then highlight the number or the text and choose a new color or attribute. If you want both the same, then just position your cursor on that cell and choose an attribute and color</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0155-01/4020-1-eng-GB/f0155-012.jpg\" width=\"462\" height=\"554\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0155-01\" title=\"f0155-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>6.

But most such attacks take place under the radar, at smaller sites lacking the skills or time to protect themselves. Take the legions of WordPressbased sites, which got a rude awakening last year when many thousands (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/thousands\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/thousands</a>) of them were hacked.</p>\n<p>Don’t be one of those sites. Even if you don’t use WordPress, you can learn important lessons from what those poor blighters have been through.</p>\n<h3><b>The un-magic bullet: site maintenance</b></h3><p>Quickly spinning up a WordPress site on a hosted server is simpler than ever, but users need to understand that the sites require regular management. Cybercriminals and hackers are continuously looking for sites whose administrators use easy-to-guess passwords, inadvertently misconfigure the site, or fail to apply the latest patch.</p>\n<p>Earlier this year, for example, security firm Zscaler found that compromised WordPress websites were forwarding visitors’ login credentials (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/zscaler\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/zscaler</a>) to an attacker-controlled site. Last year, in one of the worst cases of serial compromise, a malicious program, known as SoakSoak, infected (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/infected\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/infected</a>) more than 100,000 WordPress sites using a vulnerability in a popular plugin. “The beautiful thing about these applications is that they are easy to use and make it easy to get a website up online,” Tony Perez, CEO of Sucuri, says. “But it’s a double-edged sword—we cannot depend on the users to be able to manage the sites securely.”</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0157-01/4091-1-eng-GB/f0157-012.jpg\" width=\"592\" height=\"516\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0157-01\" title=\"f0157-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>WordPress accounts</b> for about a quarter of all websites and 60 percent of all CMSpowered websites.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p class=\"pullQuote\">Security experts don’t blame the content management systems, which typically take security seriously.</p>\n<p>Security experts don’t blame the content management systems, which typically take security seriously. But WordPress sites account for 24 percent of all websites, and Joomla and Drupal account for another 5 percent, according to Web technology firm W3Techs. The software is under intense attacker scrutiny. Attackers have historically tried brute-force password guessing as a first assault on content management systems, followed by quickly attempting to take advantage of any just-published vulnerabilities.</p>\n<p>Passwords are an easy problem for users to solve, but keeping up with a steady stream of vulnerabilities and patches requires diligence, says Mark Maunder, CEO of WordPress security firm Wordfence. These three best practices will help you fend off attackers.</p>\n<h3><b>1. Update as soon as possible</b></h3><p>Anyone managing their own site should either use a hosting service that manages the core content management system (CMS) updates or create a process to keep up with information on vulnerabilities that could impact their installation.</p>\n<p>Be warned, it’s a tough job. Subscribing to any vulnerability feeds for their software and plugins is a necessity to quickly patch vulnerabilities in either the CMS or its plugins. Yet, it’s easy to be inundated, says Sucuri’s Perez.</p>\n<p>“It is almost impossible for developers to keep up with vulnerabilities,” he says. “They are trying to run their site, and trying to keep track of all the patches and applying them is difficult.”</p>\n<p>Web-security services like Sucuri, Cloudflare and Incapsula can buy administrators more time to patch their sites, by blocking known attacks.</p>\n<h3><b>2. Don’t forget your plugins and themes</b></h3><p>While keeping the main content management system up-to-date is challenging, patching every plugin can be a more onerous burden, as attackers have increasingly targeted vulnerabilities in plugins and themes to compromise websites.</p>\n<p>“In general, attackers are trying to own as many WordPress sites as possible using as many zero days or recently-disclosed vulnerabilities, and then using that site for other attacks,” says Wordfence’s Maunder.</p>\n<p>A variety of WordPress plugins provide security. Wordfence, BulletProof Security and iThemes Security perform a variety of security-related tasks, from scanning websites for compromises to setting the security controls of a WordPress site to harden the software against the most common attacks.</p>\n<h3><b>3. Regularly maintain your website</b></h3><p>Having a hosted website is a responsibility and requires frequent maintenance. Administrators should back up the site, and make sure the backup is copied off the Web server—many inexperienced administrators overlook that step, says Maunder.</p>\n<p>If you don’t have time to do this, go with a fully managed site. <a href=\"http://WordPress.com\" target=\"_self\">WordPress.com</a> has a wide variety of templates and more flexibility than ever before. For other content management systems, such as Joomla and Drupal, a hosted service provider can manage the CMS on that server and help keep your website patched.</p>\n","layout":{"landscape":{"id":"am-landscape-5","link":"hh_secondary-l.twig"},"portrait":{"id":"am-portrait-5","link":"hh_secondary.twig"}},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":0,"link_source":"","competition":[],"flatplan_title":"","notes":"","gutter_credit":"","other":"","image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1439381070.4814","name":"f0156-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0156-012/4098-1-eng-GB/f0156-012_story_img_size_768x0.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"722","height":"768","legacy_id":"545","is_default":true},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1439381070.4814","name":"f0156-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0156-012/4098-1-eng-GB/f0156-012_story_img_size_768x0.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"722","height":"768","legacy_id":"545","is_default":false}],"related_objects":{"image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_1_1439381069.8762","name":"f0157-01","source":"","caption":"<p><b>WordPress accounts</b> for about a quarter of all websites and 60 percent of all CMSpowered websites.</p>\n","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0157-01/4091-1-eng-GB/f0157-012.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"592","height":"516","legacy_id":"544"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_1_1439381069.8762","name":"f0157-01","source":"","caption":"<p><b>WordPress accounts</b> for about a quarter of all websites and 60 percent of all CMSpowered websites.</p>\n","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0157-01/4091-1-eng-GB/f0157-012.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"592","height":"516","legacy_id":"544"}]},"url_alias":"http://pcworld-us.audiencemedia.com","type":"story","order":"23","folio_number":"156","folio_numbers":"156,157,158,159","pdf_page_index":"156","thumbnail":"http://pcworld-us.audiencemedia.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0156-012/4098-1-eng-GB/f0156-012_tablet_story_thumbnail.jpg","color":"FFFFFF","real_id":"543","main_section_id":"11","ads":[]}],"type":null,"ads":[]}}
