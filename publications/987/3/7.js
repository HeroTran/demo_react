It’s a monumental shift for both Microsoft and its customers. But Microsoft has provided a wealth of information to ease the transition, and let you upgrade to Windows 10 as simply and easily as possible.</p>\n<p>For consumers, the choice is a simple one: You’ll be upgraded to one of two versions of Windows 10: Windows 10 Home, or Windows 10 Professional. (This guide doesn’t cover the upgrade process to Windows 10 Mobile for phones.) Microsoft has also released the official retail pricing for Windows 10 (go.pcworld.com/win10cost), in case you’re building your own PC.</p>\n<p>During the update process, plan to invest some time in prep work and at least an hour in the upgrade process itself. And be careful— some of your applications may be left behind.</p>\n<p>Aside from one major component of some versions of Windows 7, however, the transition between the earlier versions of Microsoft’s operating system and the new Windows 10 should be relatively painless. Basically, if you own a Pro version of Windows, you’ll migrate to the Professional version of Windows 10. Otherwise, expect to receive a copy of Windows 10 Home.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0009-012/2731-1-eng-GB/f0009-012.jpg\" width=\"595\" height=\"243\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0009-01\" title=\"f0009-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>The upgrade</b> path from Windows 7 and 8.1 to Windows 10.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>Besides this story, a good reference is Microsoft’s Windows 10 FAQ itself (go.pcworld.com/win10FAQ), which explains, for example, what the Windows 10 reservation app is, how it works, whether you can update more than one Windows PC (yes) and whether you can cancel advice: You must be running a genuine, licensed copy of Windows. your reservation (also yes). Also, it offers one piece of important</p>\n<h3><b>Windows 10 prep work</b></h3><p>If there’s one thing you need to make sure of, though, it’s that your PC is up to date. Windows 7 users must be running Service Pack 1 to enable the update, and Windows 8 users must have upgraded to the latest version of Windows 8.1. You’ll also need to enable your Windows 10 reservation. Look for the tiny Windows icon down in the right corner of your taskbar, and click it to launch the Windows 10 reservation app. (We walk you through the reservation process at: go.pcworld.com/win10res.)</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0010-012/2724-1-eng-GB/f0010-012.jpg\" width=\"592\" height=\"93\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0010-01\" title=\"f0010-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>Here are the system requirements for Windows 10:</p>\n<p><b>Processor:</b> 1 gigahertz (GHz) or faster processor or SoC</p>\n<p><b>RAM:</b> 1 gigabyte (GB) for a 32-bit version, or 2GB for 64-bit</p>\n<p><b>Hard-disk space:</b> 16GB for a 32-bit OS; 20GB for 64-bit OS</p>\n<p><b>Graphics card:</b> DirectX 9 or later with WDDM 1.0 driver</p>\n<p><b>Display:</b> 1024 x 600</p>\n<p>Microsoft also warns that even if your PC seemingly meets those specifications, it might not be upgraded. “Driver and firmware support, application compatibility, and feature support” could affect whether the Windows 10 upgrade takes place. Fortunately, there’s one way to be sure: use the “check my PC” function within the reservation app.</p>\n<p>Microsoft advises that the Windows 10 download will be about 3GB in size. Installation will take about 20 minutes for newer PCs, and possibly more than an hour for older ones. What the reservation process does is kick off background loading of some files before Windows 10 “unlocks” on July 29. (Some preordered PC games do the same thing.)</p>\n<p class=\"pullQuote\">Take advantage of cloud storage to save critical apps and files.</p>\n<p>Be smart: Make sure all of your important files are backed up before beginning the upgrade process, either via OneDrive or a local external hard drive. By default, your files will remain on the hard drive. “Applications, files and settings will migrate as part of the upgrade, however some applications or settings may not migrate,” Microsoft says, somewhat cryptically.</p>\n<p>And yes, it’s completely free, as long as you take advantage of the upgrade before July 29, 2016. Microsoft promises that upgrades will be free for the “supported lifespan” of the device; that’s the phrase that the company hasn’t really explained fully as yet.</p>\n<h3><b>What you’ll leave behind by migrating to Windows 10</b></h3><p>The upgrade process will involve some sacrifices—but Microsoft is making an effort to make the transition as painless as possible.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0011-012/2717-1-eng-GB/f0011-012.jpg\" width=\"264\" height=\"276\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0011-01\" title=\"f0011-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>Your beloved</b> Minesweeper will be revamped for Windows 10.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>For one thing, if you own the premium versions of Windows 7—Windows 7 Home Premium, Windows 7 Professional, Windows 7 Ultimate—as well as Windows 8 Pro with Media Center or Windows 8.1 Pro with Media Center…say goodbye to Media Center. Microsoft is going to install its own DVD-playing app into Windows 10 to replace it. Likewise, Windows 7 desktop gadgets will be uninstalled. And the Windows 7 versions of Solitaire, Minesweeper, and Hearts that came with Windows 7 will also vanish, to be replaced with new versions of those apps with Windows 10.</p>\n<p>Microsoft also says that it may erase “some applications that came from your OEM.” That seems to imply that some of your PC’s bloatware—or prized utilities, depending on your view—could vanish.</p>\n<p>Finally, Microsoft will uninstall, then reinstall, your antivirus application. If your subscription is out of date, however, only Microsoft’s own subpar antivirus app, Windows Defender, will be installed. Be sure and check this after upgrading.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0012-012/2710-1-eng-GB/f0012-012.jpg\" width=\"593\" height=\"325\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0012-01\" title=\"f0012-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>Windows Hello</b> won’t recognize your face without a specialized depth camera.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>Some additional assembly required</b></h3><p>Keep in mind that older hardware simply won’t include some of the hardware conveniences being included inside new Windows 10 machines. For example, Windows Hello (go.pcworld.com/w10hello), which logs you in to your PC by recognizing your face or your fingerprint, won’t work with a webcam—you’ll need a new depth camera (like a Kinect for Windows or Intel’s RealSense) to enable it, or a fingerprint reader. Speech recognition will work best with a high-fidelity microphone array, no surprise there. And there’s a whole host of nitty-gritty specifics that Microsoft has included for Windows 10 Professional, such as a requirement for BitLocker and Wi-Fi Direct Printing.</p>\n<p>In general, however, it seems like your pre-Windows 10 checklist will be pretty short: Sign up for a “reservation” for Windows 10, back up critical files, and keep an eye on your antivirus subscription as the transition takes place. Chances are we’ll be upgrading at the same time, so you can rest assured that we’re all in it together.</p>\n","layout":{"landscape":{"id":"am-landscape-10","link":"news_article_02-l.twig"},"portrait":{"id":"am-portrait-10","link":"news_article_02.twig"}},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":0,"link_source":"","competition":[],"flatplan_title":"","notes":"Change

Now it’s writing off (go.pcworld.com/writeoff) another $7.6 billion in impairment from the Nokia Devices and Services Business and laying off 7,800 employees.

Today, we’re seeing a number of well-built two-in-one PCs or ultrabooks that are just a bit more rugged than the Surface Pro 3.</p>\n<p>But Microsoft’s Surface model also assumes two conditions that the Windows Phone market lacks: a coterie of hardware makers trained to follow Microsoft’s lead, and a healthy app ecosystem. Microsoft hoped to solve the first problem by seeding budget phones in the U.S. and abroad, boosting sales and helping to make the case that a viable market existed. Its more recent plan (go.pcworld.com/msplan) to bring iOS and Android apps to the Windows platform was designed to convince software developers that they could make money from Windows, too.</p>\n<p>Hopefully, Nadella’s memo shows that its budget phone strategy was a mistake. Apple devotees can certainly tell you what components Phone fanboy would be hard-pressed to differentiate one Lumia budget phone from another.Apple built into the iPhone 6, but even the most ardent Windows</p>\n<p>Apple has shown us that a phone maker doesn’t need dozens of unremarkable budget phones. Instead, it marks down the price of yesterday’s flagship. Neither does it depend upon a number of hardware partners eager to flood the market with their own knockoffs.</p>\n<h3><b>Another case for the Surface phone</b></h3><p>I would argue that the core experience of a Windows Phone is as vibrant as anything Apple makes. But Microsoft needs to develop a flagship phone that can embody it. So far, something like the Surface phone has been merely a concept (go.pcworld.com/concept)—but maybe it truly needs to become a reality.</p>\n<p>This fall, Microsoft needs to proudly unveil Windows 10 Mobile and show that its new operating system creates the best business phone on the market today. It needs to show how the new universal Office apps let users edit and even create documents on the road. And if, just if, they lose everything except their Windows phone, they can replace their Windows PC with a Windows 10 phone running Continuum. Those Windows 10 phones should be well-designed, desirable devices that will attract new customers and deepen the ties with Windows faithfuls.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0018-012/2774-1-eng-GB/f0018-012.jpg\" width=\"590\" height=\"360\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0018-01\" title=\"f0018-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>It’s a phone!</b> It’s a PC!

Although Windows RT looked similar to Windows 8, it couldn’t run desktop software with the exception of Microsoft’s built-in apps and Office suite. The benefits of Windows RT were minimal, as Intel quickly closed the battery efficiency gap with its lightweight Atom processors, and the drawbacks of limited functionality and customer confusion were significant.

Windows 10’s big ticket features include the Cortana virtual assistant, the new Edge browser, a pop-up desktop Start menu, and a “Continuum” feature that seamlessly switches between full-screen and windowed apps.

TSMC, the company that manufactures graphics processors for AMD and Nvidia, has been stuck at the 28nm node for years now.

IBM—working with GlobalFoundries, Samsung, SUNY Polytechnic Institute, and others—carved the transistor channels out of silicon-germanium (SiGe) alloy in order to improve electron mobility at such a small scale.

The companies utilized extreme ultraviolet lithography, which Intel has also been investing heavily in for years now. The details behind EUV get complicated, but essentially, it’s a beam of light with a far narrower wavelength (read: width) than current lithography tools. The benefits of moving to a smaller feature-etching tool when working on a chip with 7nm components is obvious.</p>\n<p>The consortium also managed to stack the chip incredibly tightly, with a 30nm transistor pitch, which helped it achieve a nearly 50 percent surface area reduction over today’s top-end chips.</p>\n<p>The 7nm SiGe chips are nowhere near production-ready, but when they’re cleared for commercial use around 2017, IBM says they’ll result in “at least a 50 percent power/performance improvement for next generation…systems” on account of all those process improvements. <i>Ars Technica</i> (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/arstech\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/arstech</a>) has a wonderfully detailed write-up on the manufacturing process for IBM’s 7nm chips.</p>\n<p>But that’s not even the most impressive number. IBM says that when the industry embraces 7nm manufacturing techniques, processors will be able to be stuffed with an incredible 20 billion transistors. By comparison, Intel’s new Broadwell-U processors pack “only” 1.9 billion transistors.</p>\n","layout":{"landscape":{"id":"am-landscape-15","link":"news_secondary_03-l.twig"},"portrait":{"id":"am-portrait-15","link":"news_secondary_03.twig"}},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":0,"link_source":"","competition":[],"flatplan_title":"","notes":"","gutter_credit":"","other":"","image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1439380984.496","name":"f0022-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0022-012/2867-1-eng-GB/f0022-012_story_img_size_768x0.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"1088","height":"768","legacy_id":"392","is_default":true},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1439380984.496","name":"f0022-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0022-012/2867-1-eng-GB/f0022-012_story_img_size_768x0.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"1088","height":"768","legacy_id":"392","is_default":false}],"related_objects":{"image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_1_1439380983.7523","name":"f0023-01","source":"DARRYL BAUTISTA/IBM","caption":"<p><b>SUNY’s</b> Michael Liehr, left, and IBM’s Bala Haranand look at a wafer of 7nm chips</p>\n","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0023-012/2860-1-eng-GB/f0023-012.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"873","height":"528","legacy_id":"391"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_1_1439380983.7523","name":"f0023-01","source":"DARRYL BAUTISTA/IBM","caption":"<p><b>SUNY’s</b> Michael Liehr, left, and IBM’s Bala Haranand look at a wafer of 7nm chips</p>\n","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0023-012/2860-1-eng-GB/f0023-012.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"873","height":"528","legacy_id":"391"}]},"url_alias":"http://pcworld-us.audiencemedia.com","type":"story","order":"3","folio_number":"22","folio_numbers":"22,23,24","pdf_page_index":"22","thumbnail":"http://pcworld-us.audiencemedia.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0022-012/2867-1-eng-GB/f0022-012_tablet_story_thumbnail.jpg","color":"FFFFFF","real_id":"390","main_section_id":"7","ads":[]},{"id":"zinio_3_100340926_1439380985.7234","title":"BBC reveals Micro:bit, a programmable PC that fits in your pocket","sub_title":"","author":[{"id":"0","name":"IAN PAUL","email":"noreply@audiencemedia.com","is_default":false}],"tag":"","strap_line":"BBC reveals Micro:bit, a programmable PC that fits in your pocket","intro":"","body":"<p class=\"byline\"><b>BY IAN PAUL</b></p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0026-012/2910-1-eng-GB/f0026-012.jpg\" width=\"598\" height=\"415\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0026-01\" title=\"f0026-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p><b>T</b>he bbc is getting into the hardware hacking craze with its second device in the last 34 years for school-age children.

Instead, it’s a basic board for embedded projects such as a gaming device or a remote control. It’s also compatible with more advanced micro PCs like the Raspberry Pi and Arduino boards for projects that require more processing heft.</p>\n<p>The 1.6-inch by 2-inch Micro:bit comes with a 32-bit ARM Cortex M0 processor, 25 programmable LED lights arranged in a grid, two push buttons for user input, an accelerometer and compass, a micro-USB connector, and Bluetooth. The device was originally supposed to come with a slot for a watch battery, but the final design cut that, opting for a battery pack add-on instead that takes two AA batteries. You can find complete specs on the BBC’s website (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/bbcuk\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/bbcuk</a>).</p>\n<p>A new programmable computer wouldn’t be much good without the tools to build something with them. To that end, there will be a new website to help students with their coding. The website will work on PCs or mobile devices, and lets students save and test their code on the site. Code can be written in standard languages including JavaScript, Python, C++, as well as Blocks (a visual programming language) and Microsoft’s Touch Develop (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/touch\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/touch</a>). Once the code is ready for real-world action, they can transfer it to the Micro:bit via Bluetooth or a USB connection.</p>\n<p>The Micro:bit is a huge collaboration between numerous tech companies including ARM, element14 (sellers of the Raspberry Pi), Microsoft, and Samsung.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0028-012/2896-1-eng-GB/f0028-012.jpg\" width=\"332\" height=\"249\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0028-01\" title=\"f0028-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>Why this matters</b></h3><p>A recurring debate in the tech world is whether there’s any sense in teaching children to program. Some argue that programming is hard and, just as not everyone needs to know how to fix a car, not everyone needs to know how to program. But with computers becoming central to pretty much everything, there is value in learning some coding basics. Most of us remember enough from math class to know you have to multiply before you add. Similarly, a familiarity with how code works and a coding mentality to problem solving can go a long way in a technology-driven world.</p>\n<h3><b>Second time at bat</b></h3><p>The Micro:bit is the BBC’s second run at sparking the interest of students in computing. In 1981, the BBC worked with Acorn Computers to produce the BBC Microcomputer System (BBC Micro) sold primarily to schools in the U.K. as part of the BBC’s Computer Literacy Project. The device was similar in form to a Commodore 64, a non-descript beige box with a keyboard that hooked up to a monitor or television.</p>\n<p>Unlike the previous computer project, the Micro:bit will be distributed to individual students thanks to the ever lowering cost of components. It will also be 18 times faster at running code, 70 times smaller, and 617 times lighter than its predecessor, the BBC says (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/bbcnews\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/bbcnews</a>).</p>\n","layout":{"landscape":{"id":"am-landscape-14","link":"news_secondary_02-l.twig"},"portrait":{"id":"am-portrait-14","link":"news_secondary_02.twig"}},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":0,"link_source":"","competition":[],"flatplan_title":"","notes":"","gutter_credit":"","other":"","image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1439380987.5204","name":"f0026-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0026-012/2910-1-eng-GB/f0026-012_story_img_size_768x0.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"1107","height":"768","legacy_id":"397","is_default":true},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1439380987.5204","name":"f0026-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0026-012/2910-1-eng-GB/f0026-012_story_img_size_768x0.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"1107","height":"768","legacy_id":"397","is_default":false}],"related_objects":{"image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_2_1439380986.0183","name":"f0028-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0028-012/2896-1-eng-GB/f0028-012.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"332","height":"249","legacy_id":"395"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_2_1439380986.0183","name":"f0028-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0028-012/2896-1-eng-GB/f0028-012.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"332","height":"249","legacy_id":"395"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_1_1439380986.8078","name":"f0027-01","source":"","caption":"<p><b>The Micro:bit</b> requires an add-on battery pack to work as a standalone device</p>\n","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0027-012/2903-1-eng-GB/f0027-012.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"591","height":"332","legacy_id":"396"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_1_1439380986.8078","name":"f0027-01","source":"","caption":"<p><b>The Micro:bit</b> requires an add-on battery pack to work as a standalone device</p>\n","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0027-012/2903-1-eng-GB/f0027-012.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"591","height":"332","legacy_id":"396"}]},"url_alias":"http://pcworld-us.audiencemedia.com","type":"story","order":"4","folio_number":"26","folio_numbers":"26,27,28","pdf_page_index":"26","thumbnail":"http://pcworld-us.audiencemedia.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0026-012/2910-1-eng-GB/f0026-012_tablet_story_thumbnail.jpg","color":"FFFFFF","real_id":"394","main_section_id":"7","ads":[]},{"id":"zinio_3_100340926_1439380988.9724","title":"AMD Catalyst 15.7 drivers add pretty much every feature Radeon gamers begged for","sub_title":"","author":[{"id":"0","name":"BRAD CHACOS","email":"noreply@audiencemedia.com","is_default":false}],"tag":"","strap_line":"AMD Catalyst 15.7 drivers","intro":"","body":"<p class=\"byline\"><b>BY BRAD CHACOS</b></p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0030-01/2960-1-eng-GB/f0030-012.jpg\" width=\"873\" height=\"588\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0030-01\" title=\"f0030-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p><b>A</b>MD’s polishing up software support for its new Fury X and Radeon R300 series graphics cards with the release of new WHQLcertified Catalyst 15.7 drivers. This sweeping update plays nicely with Windows 10, adds the clamored-for (and oft-delayed) CrossFire multi-GPU support for FreeSync monitors (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/crossfire\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/crossfire</a>), and extends some of AMD’s formerly exclusive features (like frame rate target control) to the full range of older Radeon R200 series graphics cards.</p>\n<p>The Windows 10 support is no surprise, given that Microsoft’s nextgen operating system launches as we go to press.

DirectX 12 cometh (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/directx\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/directx</a>)! But beyond that, Catalyst 15.7’s new offerings should have Radeon gamers shouting “Hallelujah!” from the rooftops.</p>\n<h3><b>The story behind the story</b></h3><p>AMD is often criticized for failing to release new WHQL-certified drivers at the same blistering pace as Nvidia. That said, the abundance of new goodies enabled in Catalyst 15.7 proves that AMD can stay feature-competitive with the GeForce gang, even if those features are released at a slightly slower pace—and they’re sure to bring a smile to the faces of Radeon gamers everywhere.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0031-012/2953-1-eng-GB/f0031-012.jpg\" width=\"591\" height=\"370\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0031-01\" title=\"f0031-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>What’s new in AMD’s Catalyst 15.7 drivers</b></h3><p>The first of many improvements in the drivers is FreeSync support for CrossFire setups. AMD’s FreeSync (and Nvidia’s competing G-Sync) force your monitor and your graphics card to synchronize their refresh rates—hence the name—to provide a silky-smooth gaming experience free of screen-tearing and stuttering. Simply put, they rock.</p>\n<p>The first FreeSync monitors rolled out in March, but without support for multi-GPU CrossFire setups. That was kind of a bummer: FreeSync rocks, but buying a FreeSync-compatible monitor essentially locks you into using Radeon-brand graphics cards for five to ten years. That makes it most appealing to AMD’s Team Red diehards—aka, the very people most likely to be running a multi-GPU CrossFire setup. AMD had to cancel its initial plans to release CrossFire FreeSync support in April, stating “it’s now clear to us that support for AMD FreeSync monitors on a multi-GPU system is not quite ready for release”—but now it is. Hallelujah! (AMD dual-GPU configurations that pair an APU with a single discrete graphics card aren’t supported, however.)</p>\n<p>More importantly for gamers with more modest setups, Catalyst 15.7 extends support for AMD’s nifty Virtual Super Resolution and Frame Rate Target Control technologies to a wider range of older hardware.</p>\n<p>Virtual Super Resolution debuted with AMD’s feature-stuffed Catalyst Omega drivers last December, but it worked only with a handful of high-end graphics cards (the R9 285, R9 290, R9 290X, and dual-GPU R9 295X2), ostensibly due to the need for internal hardware scalers. Well, somebody at AMD must have figured out some software trickery, because VSR is now supported on those GPUs, the full range of new Radeon R300 series graphics cards, and all Radeon R7 260 and above GPUs, along with all A-series 7400K and above desktop GPUs. (Hallelujah!)</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0032-012/2946-1-eng-GB/f0032-012.jpg\" width=\"590\" height=\"323\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0032-01\" title=\"f0032-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>Virtual Super Resolution forces your graphics card to render games at a higher resolution than your monitor natively supports, then downsamples the image to your display’s native resolution when it’s sent to your monitor. Doing so enables a far wider field of view in games and provides smoother edges on images—functioning kindasorta like anti-aliasing. Virtual resolutions up to a full 4K are supported, if your hardware and monitor both support it.</p>\n<p>Frame Rate Target Control, on the other hand, appeared in the launch drivers for the Radeon R300 series graphics cards in June. This technology essentially lets you set a hard cap on your frame rates in games, which—as our extensive testing proved (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/control\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/control</a>)—can provide tangible, large benefits for both power and heat use when it’s enabled with titles that push a tremendous amount of frame anyway.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0033-012/2939-1-eng-GB/f0033-012.jpg\" width=\"590\" height=\"464\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0033-01\" title=\"f0033-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>Power savings</b> provided by enabling FRTC at various cap levels in BioShock: Infinite.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>The fact that the feature was originally limited to new R300-series cards irked some Radeon faithful, as the GPUs at the heart of the new graphics cards are essentially retooled versions of the graphics processors that also powered the older R200 series.

roughly 4 meters tall.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n

blacksmith Kogoro Kurata, who was inspired by the “mecha” robots of Japanese science fiction animation.</p>\n<p>Weighing some 5,000 kilograms, Kuratas has three wheels, two arms, a one-person cockpit and various mock weapons that shoot pellets and fireworks. It was put on sale on Amazon Japan as a starter kit for ¥120 million ($976,000) but is now listed as unavailable.</p>\n<p>“We can’t let another country win this,” Kurata, who is CEO of Suidobashi, said in a video posted to YouTube (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/kuratas\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/kuratas</a>). “Giant robots are Japanese culture.”</p>\n<p>Suidobashi did not immediately respond to a request for more information.</p>\n<p>The contest, which would take place next June, set the hearts of robot geeks aflutter after the challenge was issued in an over-the-top video (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/megabots\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/megabots</a>) by MegaBots that has notched more than 2 million views.</p>\n<p>MegaBots’ Mark II robot weighs some 5,400 kg, is piloted by a team of two, and moves around on tank-like tracks. Its cannons can fire 1.3-kg paint balls at 161 kilometers per hour. The company wants to build enough robots to form teams that would fight in arenas, but its 2014 Kickstarter campaign (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/kickstarter\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/kickstarter</a>) failed to reach its goal of $1.8 million.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0038-012/2989-1-eng-GB/f0038-012.jpg\" width=\"477\" height=\"623\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0038-01\" title=\"f0038-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>Suidobashi</b> Heavy Industry’s Kurata.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>Kurata said he wants the robots to be able to engage in a full-on knock-down fight to make the duel interesting.</p>\n<p>Indeed, living up to audience expectations could be the most challenging aspect of the fight. Kuratas and MegaBots Mark II are very costly to make and carry human pilots, so allowing them to be destroyed or seriously damaged in battle would likely be out of the question.</p>\n<p>But the spectacle would be better than other robot clashes, and could even form the basis for an annual piloted robot championship. As viewers of the recent DARPA Robotics Challenge finals (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/darpa1\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/darpa1</a>) saw, contests involving autonomous robots can be painfully slow. Even the matches at RoboCup (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/robocup\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/robocup</a>), an international competition aimed at developing fleetfooted, dextrous robots that can beat the best human soccer players, can move at a glacial pace as droids clumsily try to dribble the ball, kick it, and then topple over.</p>\n","layout":{"landscape":{"id":"am-landscape-15","link":"news_secondary_03-l.twig"},"portrait":{"id":"am-portrait-15","link":"news_secondary_03.twig"}},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":0,"link_source":"","competition":[],"flatplan_title":"","notes":"","gutter_credit":"","other":"","image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1439380995.3702","name":"f0036-01","source":"ILLUSTRATION BY CARLOS DELEON","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0036-012/3003-1-eng-GB/f0036-012_story_img_size_768x0.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"1048","height":"768","legacy_id":"408","is_default":true},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1439380995.3702","name":"f0036-01","source":"ILLUSTRATION BY CARLOS DELEON","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0036-012/3003-1-eng-GB/f0036-012_story_img_size_768x0.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"1048","height":"768","legacy_id":"408","is_default":false}],"related_objects":{"image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_2_1439380994.0728","name":"f0038-01","source":"","caption":"<p><b>Suidobashi</b> Heavy Industry’s Kurata.</p>\n","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0038-012/2989-1-eng-GB/f0038-012.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"477","height":"623","legacy_id":"406"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_2_1439380994.0728","name":"f0038-01","source":"","caption":"<p><b>Suidobashi</b> Heavy Industry’s Kurata.</p>\n","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0038-012/2989-1-eng-GB/f0038-012.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"477","height":"623","legacy_id":"406"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_1_1439380994.6368","name":"f0037-01","source":"","caption":"<p><b>MegaBots’</b> Mark II robot.</p>\n","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0037-012/2996-1-eng-GB/f0037-012.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"591","height":"392","legacy_id":"407"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_1_1439380994.6368","name":"f0037-01","source":"","caption":"<p><b>MegaBots’</b> Mark II robot.</p>\n","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0037-012/2996-1-eng-GB/f0037-012.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"591","height":"392","legacy_id":"407"}]},"url_alias":"http://pcworld-us.audiencemedia.com","type":"story","order":"6","folio_number":"36","folio_numbers":"36,37,38","pdf_page_index":"36","thumbnail":"http://pcworld-us.audiencemedia.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0036-012/3003-1-eng-GB/f0036-012_tablet_story_thumbnail.jpg","color":"FFFFFF","real_id":"405","main_section_id":"7","ads":[]}],"type":null,"ads":[]}}
