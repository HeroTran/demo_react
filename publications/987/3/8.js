An update (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/fbapp\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/fbapp</a>) to Facebook’s iOS app expands the existing News Feed Preferences section with a way to choose whose updates appear at the top of the timeline. A similar update is coming to Facebook’s Android app and desktop website in the coming weeks.</p>\n<p>Users can check out the new settings by pressing the More button in the Facebook app’s bottom right corner, then tapping on News Feed Preferences and selecting Prioritize Who To See First. This brings up a list of friends and Pages that users can mark as favorites. Unread updates from favorite contacts will always appear at the top of the News Feed, overriding Facebook’s predictive algorithms.</p>\n<p>This preferences menu also lets users “unfollow” certain contacts, which simply hides their updates without severing the friendship. Other options include a way to discover new Pages based on ones that users have liked in the past, and a Reconnect menu that shows a list of unfollowed friends.</p>\n<h3><b>Why this matters</b></h3><p>Until now, Facebook has relied extensively on its own algorithms to decide what users see, drawing on their histories of likes, comments, and other interactions. But machine learning doesn’t always work perfectly, and can leave people with News Feeds that they’re less likely to interact with in the first place. Users have always wanted ways around the algorithm—just look at the number of people trying to sort their feeds chronologically (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/sort\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/sort</a>)—and the new preferences are one way to add greater flexibility.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0041-012/3032-1-eng-GB/f0041-012.jpg\" width=\"352\" height=\"890\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0041-01\" title=\"f0041-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div>","layout":{"portrait":{"id":"am-portrait-2","link":"hh_article_02.twig"}},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":0,"link_source":"","competition":[],"flatplan_title":"","notes":"","gutter_credit":"","other":"","image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1439380997.4625","name":"f0040-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0040-012/3039-1-eng-GB/f0040-012_default_ipad_portrait.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"320","height":"653","legacy_id":"412","is_default":true},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1439380997.4625","name":"f0040-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0040-012/3039-1-eng-GB/f0040-012_default_ipad_landscape.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"320","height":"653","legacy_id":"412","is_default":false}],"related_objects":{"image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_1_1439380996.7017","name":"f0041-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0041-012/3032-1-eng-GB/f0041-012.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"352","height":"890","legacy_id":"411"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_1_1439380996.7017","name":"f0041-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0041-012/3032-1-eng-GB/f0041-012.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"352","height":"890","legacy_id":"411"}]},"url_alias":"http://pcworld-us.audiencemedia.com","type":"story","order":"7","folio_number":"40","folio_numbers":"40,41","pdf_page_index":"40","thumbnail":"http://pcworld-us.audiencemedia.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0040-012/3039-1-eng-GB/f0040-012_tablet_story_thumbnail.jpg","color":"FFFFFF","real_id":"410","main_section_id":"8","ads":[]},{"id":"zinio_3_100340926_1439380998.4432","title":"Privacy group file FTC complaint against Google","sub_title":"","author":[{"id":"0","name":"GRANT GROSS","email":"noreply@audiencemedia.com","is_default":false}],"tag":"","strap_line":"Privacy group file FTC complaint against Google","intro":"","body":"<p class=\"byline\"><b>BY GRANT GROSS</b></p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0042-012/3075-1-eng-GB/f0042-012.jpg\" width=\"873\" height=\"670\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0042-01\" title=\"f0042-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p><b>G</b>oogle’s refusal to implement the EU’s controversial right-to-be-forgotten rules in the United States amounts to an unfair and deceptive business practice, a frequent critic of the search engine giant said.</p>\n<p>Consumer Watchdog (<a href=\"http://consumerwatchdog.org\" target=\"_self\">consumerwatchdog.org</a>) filed a complaint against Google with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, said John Simpson, director of the group’s Privacy Project.

Everything—all our digital footprints—are instantly available with a few clicks on a computer or taps on a mobile device.”</p>\n<p>A Google representative didn’t respond to a request for comment on bringing the right to be forgotten to the United States.</p>\n<p>Since launching as the Inside Google Project in late 2008, Consumer Watchdog’s Privacy Project has largely targeted Google, while paying significantly less attention to the privacy practices of several other Internet companies. Google representatives have questioned the impartiality of the group.</p>\n<p>Under the European Union’s right-to-be-forgotten rules, residents of EU countries can ask search engines to delete links to information about them they find objectionable. The ruling, which went into effect in May 2014, does not require the information be deleted from the Internet, only that search engines not link to it.</p>\n<p class=\"pullQuote\">The EU’s rule has been controversial, with some critics saying it amounts to censorship.</p>\n<p>The European Union’s rule has been controversial, with some critics saying it amounts to censorship. “As a simple test, ask yourself whether this would be possible in the United States without a repeal or modification of the First Amendment—it would not,” Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales said last year.</p>\n<p>Google, the largest search engine, has granted about 41 percent of the right-to-be-forgotten requests it has received in Europe. In several cases, Google has declined to remove links to news stories about criminal activity.</p>\n<p>Google has managed right-to-be-forgotten requests in Europe in a way that is not “burdensome” to the company, Consumer Watchdog said. Since the European Union implemented the right-to-be-forgotten rule, Google has received about 1 million requests to remove links from its search engine.</p>\n<p>Google’s cost of reviewing requests should be part of its “reasonable cost of doing business as a search engine,” Simpson said. The rule should apply in the United States not only to Google, but to other search engines as well, he added.</p>\n<p>Consumer Watchdog has focused on Google because it is “so dominant as a search engine,” Simpson said.</p>\n<p>Consumer Watchdog is not attempting to bring strong EU privacy laws to the United States, Simpson added. But real people are being “hurt” by Google’s failure to honor U.S. requests, he said.</p>\n<p>“We’re not arguing that European laws should apply in the U.S.,” he said. “We’re saying that aggressively marketing yourself as being concerned about consumers’ privacy, but not offering a key privacy tool is deceptive.”</p>\n","layout":{"landscape":{"id":"am-landscape-6","link":"hh_secondary_02-l.twig"},"portrait":{"id":"am-portrait-6","link":"hh_secondary_02.twig"}},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":0,"link_source":"","competition":[],"flatplan_title":"","notes":"","gutter_credit":"","other":"","image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1439380999.1451","name":"f0042-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0042-012/3075-1-eng-GB/f0042-012_story_img_size_768x0.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"1001","height":"768","legacy_id":"416","is_default":true},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1439380999.1451","name":"f0042-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0042-012/3075-1-eng-GB/f0042-012_story_img_size_768x0.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"1001","height":"768","legacy_id":"416","is_default":false}],"related_objects":{"image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_1_1439380998.5683","name":"f0043-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0043-01/3068-1-eng-GB/f0043-012.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"341","height":"341","legacy_id":"415"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_1_1439380998.5683","name":"f0043-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0043-01/3068-1-eng-GB/f0043-012.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"341","height":"341","legacy_id":"415"}]},"url_alias":"http://pcworld-us.audiencemedia.com","type":"story","order":"8","folio_number":"42","folio_numbers":"42,43,44","pdf_page_index":"42","thumbnail":"http://pcworld-us.audiencemedia.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0042-012/3075-1-eng-GB/f0042-012_tablet_story_thumbnail.jpg","color":"FFFFFF","real_id":"414","main_section_id":"8","ads":[]},{"id":"zinio_3_100340926_1439381000.6435","title":"The vanishing: What happened to Google Street View’s missing streets?","sub_title":"","author":[{"id":"0","name":"ZACH MINERS","email":"noreply@audiencemedia.com","is_default":false}],"tag":"","strap_line":"What happened to Google Street View’s missing streets?","intro":"","body":"<p class=\"byline\"><b>BY ZACH MINERS</b></p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0046-01/3125-1-eng-GB/f0046-012.jpg\" width=\"873\" height=\"517\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0046-01\" title=\"f0046-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p><b>W</b>ith the arrival of El Capitan (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/elcapitan2\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/elcapitan2</a>) on Google Street View recently, you can now haul yourself virtually up one of the most famous rock faces in the world. Navigating certain streets in urban areas, however, can still be a challenge.</p>\n<p>As Google expands Street View into ever more exotic places, it appears to have a problem in many of the towns and cities where the service has been available for years. Look closely at any major city, especially the residential areas, and Street View is littered with hundreds, even thousands, of little gaps. And although it’s hard to be sure, the problem may be getting worse.</p>\n<p>Street View is still a powerful tool and the gaps don’t greatly diminish its utility—unless they happen to be in front of the building you’re searching for. But it’s strange that even in cities that Google’s cars have photographed several times over, there are still numerous stretches— sometimes whole streets—where Street View imagery isn’t available.</p>\n<h3><b>A bug, not a feature</b></h3><p>Google called the gaps a “known issue” and implied it’s due partly to a glitch in its early mapping software. But it refused to answer questions beyond that, including whether privacy requests are a factor, and whether the gaps are becoming more frequent.</p>\n<p>“In places where we collected very early Street View imagery, the old data may sometimes cause an issue that prevents new images from surfacing,” the company said via email. “We’ve so far prioritized refresh of the bulk of the Street View imagery for our users, and we are certainly also working to fill these occasional gaps.”</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0047-012/3118-1-eng-GB/f0047-012.jpg\" width=\"592\" height=\"399\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0047-01\" title=\"f0047-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>The Barnsbury area</b> of north London, where there are gaps in Street View, pictured July 2, 2015.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>There are two types of gaps, broadly speaking. One is where a building has been blurred, which poses little problem for Street View explorers and is almost certainly due to a privacy request. Harder to fathom is where sections of streets are missing, signified by gaps in the blue lines that appear when you click on the yellow Street View icon in Google Maps.</p>\n<p>There could be many reasons for the gaps, as Google has discussed in the past. In some cases, construction work may have prevented its mapping car from passing through. A wide swathe of Hunters Point (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/hunterspoint\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/hunterspoint</a>) in San Francisco is missing, for example, but the images of adjacent streets show a lot of construction was going on. In other cases, a Street View driver might have skipped a street by accident, or the camera or recording software might have malfunctioned.</p>\n<p class=\"pullQuote\">One possible culprit is that people have asked to have their homes blurred for privacy reasons.</p>\n<h3><b>Why wasn’t this caught in subsequent visits?</b></h3><p>But Google often revisits towns to update its imagery, and it’s hard to see why the Sunset residential district in San Francisco, for example—more or less in Google’s backyard—would have so many gaps (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/gaps\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/gaps</a>). The pattern is similar in Tokyo, London, Berlin, and many other cities around the world. The gaps aren’t big, and it’s possible to overlook them at first glance, but once you’re aware they exist, they seem to appear all over the place.</p>\n<p>One possible culprit is that people have asked to have their homes blurred for privacy reasons. Google explains on its Maps privacy page (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/viewprivacy\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/viewprivacy</a>) how to request this, and it’s a relatively simple process.</p>\n<p>Famous people often file such requests. There’s a gap in the Street View imagery outside Mark Zuckerberg’s house in Palo Alto, for instance, although his home was visible in the past. But a lot of regular folk have asked to have their homes removed too, judging by the prevalence of blurred images in residential areas.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0049-01/3111-1-eng-GB/f0049-012.jpg\" width=\"592\" height=\"367\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0049-01\" title=\"f0049-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>Google has blurred</b> out the home of Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook’s chief operating officer.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>In some cases, those blurring requests may have caused some of the gaps in Street View. If you approach the edge of a gap on a residential street, you can often zoom in and see a house in the missing section that’s been blurred out. It’s hard to be sure about the causes, though, since Google isn’t talking.</p>\n<h3><b>Nein, says Germany</b></h3><p>In extreme cases, whole countries are affected. Privacy has been a particular issue in Germany, where many people objected to the rollout of Street View. Google now has Street View images only for big cities in Germany, like Berlin and Frankfurt, and appears to have given up on the rest of the country completely. Zoom out over Europe in Street View mode and Germany is mostly a blank island in (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/blankisland\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/blankisland</a>) a sea of blue.</p>\n<p>Some users have noted the gaps in a Google Maps forum (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/mapforum\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/mapforum</a>), and they point to some strange examples. On the tiny island of San Andres in the Caribbean Sea, a Street View car appears to have driven a third of the way around the island’s perimeter road and then stopped for no obvious reason. There are no apparent obstacles or construction—though there does happen to be a bar by the side of the road where the car stopped capturing images.</p>\n<p>There’s another curiosity in San Francisco’s Presidio Terrace, (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/presidio\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/presidio</a>) a gated community with a circular road and about two dozen homes. Most of it doesn’t appear on Street View, but there are a few short stretches deep inside the complex that do. A telltale shadow shows that one of Google’s cars was in there, but for some reason Google displays images for only a fraction of it.</p>\n<p>Other reasons for gaps in Street View could include temporary lane closures, the construction of new roads since Google photographed an area, and safety issues that prevented drivers visiting certain streets, said Jon Froehlich, an assistant professor of computer science at the University of Maryland, College Park, who has used Street View imagery to study accessibility problems (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/accessibility\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/accessibility</a>).</p>\n<p>Plenty of exotic locales are impressively covered, however, and Google is adding more all the time. If you want to use Street View to check out the Great Barrier Reef (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/reef\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/reef</a>)—where the fish apparently have no concerns about privacy—you can really go to town.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n

announced that there would be no added charges for its U.S.-based Simple Choice customers when they call, text, or use data to Mexico and Canada or when traveling there.</p>\n<p>The move makes T-Mobile the first carrier to offer continental phone service under a single plan anywhere in the world, company officials said.</p>\n<p>The new Mobile without Borders plan means that customers can call from the United States to both countries for no added cost, as well as make calls from those countries when they travel in either one.</p>\n<p>Both consumers and business customers will be eligible, although business customers will pay $1 more per phone line for accounts with more than 10 phone lines, with no added cost for the first 10 lines.</p>\n<p>T-Mobile CEO John Legere said the impact on business customers will be especially pronounced. About 70 percent of travel by small and medium-size businesses is to both countries, T-Mobile said, citing data from the travel industry. Also, 35 percent of all international calls across the phone industry were from the United States to the two countries last year.</p>\n<h3><b>Spiting Donald Trump</b></h3><p>During a conference call (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/conference\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/conference</a>) to announce the new plan, Legere blasted GOP presidential contender Donald Trump for his comments on wanting to build a wall on the U.S. border with Mexico, at a time when joint trade opportunities are expanding and the need for affordable communication and interactions is expanding. The new Mobile without Borders phone plan offers an alternative to the proposed wall, he contended, while jabbing at Trump.</p>\n<p>“Donald Trump wants to put a wall up, but our phone coverage will work seamlessly” between the two countries, Legere said. “Don’t worry about the wall.” He quickly added: “Sorry, Donald, for hurting your major platform for running for president. Donald Trump is the gift that keeps on giving…He really is entertaining.”</p>\n<p>Legere saved his biggest condemnation for AT&amp;T CEO Randall Stephenson, for recently buying two Mexican wireless carriers for $4 billion to be able to offer AT&amp;T phone services there as well as in the United States. “Sorry, Randall, you are not the only and first” provider for Mexico and the United States, Legere said.</p>\n<h3><b>Reciprocal roaming</b></h3><p>Legere said it wasn’t necessary for T-Mobile to operate its own network in Canada and Mexico and will rely instead on the two largest carriers in each country to supply service. T-Mobile was able to forge reciprocal roaming deals with the four foreign carriers, which he didn’t name, to lower traditional costs. In Mexico, Telcel, with 70 million customers, and Movistar, with 20 million, are the two largest carriers, according to recent industry data. In Canada, Rogers is the largest, with 9 million customers, while Telus and Bell are nearly tied, with 8 million apiece.</p>\n<p>Those T-Mobile partners have plenty of 4G LTE service in major cities that offer fast data services, Legere said. Even though T-Mobile has expanded LTE coverage in the United States, critics often ding the carrier for having weak or spotty coverage outside of major U.S. cities. Analysts said it remains to be seen how thorough the coverage is in Canada and Mexico.</p>\n<p class=\"pullQuote\">T-Mobile was able to forge reciprocal roaming deals with the four foreign carriers, which Legere didn’t name, to lower traditional costs.</p>\n<h3><b>International appeal</b></h3><p>Even with such concerns, analysts said the new plan will appeal to travelers, both consumer and business.</p>\n<p>“T-Mobile is stealing the industry’s—and especially AT&amp;T’s thunder—by expanding the free calling area to Mexico and Canada,” said Roger Entner, an analyst at Recon Analytics. “The new plan is most appealing to people who, no surprise, call and travel to Mexico and Canada the most.”</p>\n<p>T-Mobile posted details on Mobile without Borders for consumers (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/consumer\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/consumer</a>) as well as for business customers (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/bconsumer\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/bconsumer</a>) on its website.</p>\n<p>For business customers using Mobile without Borders, T-Mobile adapted its Un-carrier for Business (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/uncarrier\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/uncarrier</a>) plans announced in March.</p>\n<h3><b>Business plans affected, too</b></h3><p>Under the March announcement, the first 20 business lines would cost $16 a line (or $15 a line for 21 lines or more) per month, which includes voice and text and 1GB of data. With the Mobile without Borders plan, the first 10 business lines cost nothing extra, but there is a $1 added cost per phone line for 11 or more lines, T-Mobile officials said.</p>\n<p>With the Mobile without Borders plan, 50 percent of the calls, texts, and data used every three months must be done from inside the United States. That restriction keeps the plan devoted to U.S.-based customers, T-Mobile said.</p>\n<p>The March business plan was immediately so successful that it produced a 120 percent increase in traffic flow into 3,000 T-Mobile stores, Legere said. T-Mobile might provide more details on the bottom-line impact of its business plans when it announces earnings on July 30, he hinted.</p>\n<p>“Overall, we’ve been astounded” by the interest from businesses, said Rakesh Mahajan, senior director of marketing for @Work at T-Mobile. Some customers have said they didn’t realize T-Mobile was in the market for business customers.</p>\n<p>Mahajan said Mobile without Borders could be expanded beyond Mexico and Canada to other countries. “We started with the biggest opportunity and customers will figure out where we go next,” he said. Legere and other officials didn’t commit to offering such a plan in Europe, when asked.</p>\n<p>Mexico, in particular, has been an attractive market because trade barriers have been lowered in recent years, meaning more U.S. businesses are working with manufacturing partners in Mexico, he said.</p>\n","layout":{},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":0,"link_source":"","competition":[],"flatplan_title":"","notes":"","gutter_credit":"","other":"","image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1439381003.9839","name":"f0052-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0052-012/3154-1-eng-GB/f0052-012_default_ipad_portrait.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"768","height":"575","legacy_id":"425","is_default":true},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1439381003.9839","name":"f0052-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0052-012/3154-1-eng-GB/f0052-012_default_ipad_landscape.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"886","height":"663","legacy_id":"425","is_default":false}],"url_alias":"http://pcworld-us.audiencemedia.com","type":"story","order":"10","folio_number":"52","folio_numbers":"52,53,54,55","pdf_page_index":"52","thumbnail":"http://pcworld-us.audiencemedia.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0052-012/3154-1-eng-GB/f0052-012_tablet_story_thumbnail.jpg","color":"FFFFFF","real_id":"424","main_section_id":"8","ads":[]}],"type":null,"ads":[]}}
