If you've read anything else on Threadripper or &quot;Ryzen 9,&quot; it's nothing but rumor and speculation at this point. You may say the leaks look good, but we'll point out that they didn't even seem to get the name right, so you gotta wonder.</p>\n<h3><b>What will it be called?</b></h3><p>AMD's Jim Anderson introduced the new CPU as &quot;Ryzen Threadripper&quot; instead of the &quot;Ryzen 9&quot; moniker that had been rumored.</p>\n<p>Yes, Anderson did speak of &quot;beyond Ryzen 7,&quot; but the lack of a 9 was glaring.</p>\n<p>Even more telling, AMD's James Prior scolded one person on Twitter who used the number, writing: &quot;There was no ' 9 ' in the name—it's just Ryzen Threadripper. Accuracy matters.&quot;</p>\n<h3><b>What can previous Ryzen reviews tell us about what to expect from Threadripper performance?</b></h3><p>We won't know the full effect of Ryzen Threadripper's 16 cores and 32 threads until we test it. Meanwhile, our reviews of Ryzen 7 (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/ryzenrev\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/ryzenrev</a>) and Ryzen 5 (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/ryzen5rev\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/ryzen5rev</a>) can give you insights into the strengths and weaknesses of the Ryzen family.</p>\n<p>Threadripper could perform quite differently, however, if it does indeed have increased memory bandwidth from the rumored quad-channel controller. We also don't know the final clock speeds. For the most part, the core performance shouldn't change much, but stay tuned for our review.</p>\n<h3><b>What about the 14, 12, and 10-core versions?</b></h3><p>The only Threadripper AMD formally announced was the 16-core part. Yes, we know you've seen reports of 14, 12, and 10-core versions. We think that would make a lot of sense, as it matches up with previous CPU introductions.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0011-0152/173581-1-eng-GB/f0011-012.jpg\" width=\"507\" height=\"292\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0011-01\" title=\"f0011-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>AMD's long-awaited Ryzen</b> 7 1800X is a multi-threaded monster.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>What about the chipset and other specs?</b></h3><p>Again, there is no official news on this front, but the rumor mills have been active, saying all versions of the &quot;Ryzen 9&quot; would feature 44 PCIe lanes and quad-channel RAM support on the X390 and X399 chipset and the SP3 socket using 4,094 pins. The model numbers would predictably run in the 1900s, with the 10-core being the &quot;Ryzen 9 1955&quot; and the top end 16-core labeled as the &quot;Ryzen 9 1998X.&quot; The same rumor mills put the thermals at 155 watts at the top down to 125 watts at the bottom.</p>\n<p>Again, these are rumors, but with Computex and E3 just around the corner we should get firmer information soon.</p>\n<h3><b>What will Threadripper go up against?</b></h3><p>Threadripper will immediately go head-to-head with Intel's top consumer processor, the Core i7-6950X. As we found in our review (go. <a href=\"http://pcworld.com/10corei7-6950X\" target=\"_self\">pcworld.com/10corei7-6950X</a>) of that 10-core Broadwell CPU, it's a beast in its own right. One cool feature introduced in the Core i7-6950X is TurboBoost Max, which grades every CPU at the factory on how high it will clock up to.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0012-0142/173574-1-eng-GB/f0012-012.jpg\" width=\"304\" height=\"247\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0012-01\" title=\"f0012-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>At one point,</b> people believed the Core i7-980X would be called Core i9, but generations have passed with no such name.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>What about &quot;Core i9?&quot;</b></h3><p>AMD isn't the only company working on a monster CPU for consumers. Intel is also rumored to be planning a 12-core CPU using Skylake cores. While Broadwell-E and Haswell-E chips have been nearly identical to the the desktop cores they're based on, the so-called &quot;Skylake-X&quot; is expected to feature support for AVX-512 instructions, which could boost performance in apps that support it.</p>\n<p>The CPU would use a new X299 chipset, feature 44 PCIe lanes and quad-channel memory support. The CPU would adopt a new &quot;Core i9&quot; naming scheme.</p>\n<p>Intel has never publicly confirmed the new chip, but the rumors appear to be pretty solid. Of course, this isn't the first time we were supposed to see a Core i9. In 2009 PCWorld reported that the 6-core Gulftown CPU from Intel was supposed to be &quot;Core i9,&quot; so who knows what will happen.</p>\n<h3><b>Will you really benefit from that many cores?</b></h3><p>With Intel and AMD playing a core war this summer, you'd assume that more cores means better performance. The truth is more nuanced. How many cores you need really depends on what you do. If you primarily play games, a mega-core PC isn't likely to yield the performance you'd expect. If, however, you edit video, render 3D, and run other intensive workstation-like tasks, more cores generally means less waiting. Having an embarrassing number of cores can also aid in heavy-duty multitasking. You know, like simultaneously rendering 3D, video, audio, and playing games.</p>\n<h3><b>How much will it cost?</b></h3><p>The fact that AMD is planning to introduce new CPUs with crazy core and thread counts isn't the big deal. What's more important is how much it will cost. Intel's 8-core CPUs have never cost less than $1,000.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0013-0154/173567-1-eng-GB/f0013-012.jpg\" width=\"591\" height=\"490\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0013-01\" title=\"f0013-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>Even Handbrake can't</b> use all the resources of an 18-core, 36-thread CPU, so buy a mega-core CPU only if you can really use it properly.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>The 10-core Core i7-6950X cost $1,723. Does that mean a 16-core CPU will cost $2,000? Perhaps AMD anticipates Intel will reset its prices this summer, and it's trying to head off Intel at the pass. No one knows, and even the rumor-mongering press haven't placed any bets.</p>\n","layout":{},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":1,"link_source":"","competition":[],"flatplan_title":"","notes":"","gutter_credit":"","other":"","image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1496850458.998","name":"f0009-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0009-0160/173595-1-eng-GB/f0009-012.jpg?t=default_ipad_portrait&ext/f0009-012_default_ipad_portrait.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"768","height":"443","legacy_id":"18232","is_default":true},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1496850458.998","name":"f0009-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0009-0160/173595-1-eng-GB/f0009-012.jpg?t=default_ipad_landscape&ext/f0009-012_default_ipad_landscape.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"1024","height":"591","legacy_id":"18232","is_default":false}],"related_objects":{"image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_4_1496850454.1082","name":"f0013-01","source":"","caption":"<p><b>Even

consumer-focused product announcements as well—and Build 2017 was no exception.</p>\n<p>From the future of Windows to Cortana everywhere to an app that uses machine learning and mixed realities to make your movies <i>awesome,</i> these are the biggest reveals from Build 2017 that everyday users should care about.</p>\n<h3><b>500 million Windows 10 devices</b></h3><p>Let’s get the flashy numbers out of the way first. Microsoft says there are half a billion Windows 10 devices in the wild—far off the adoption pace Microsoft originally envisioned for the operating system, but still a staggering number.</p>\n<p>Of those, 141 million devices use the Cortana digital assistant monthly. That’s a big number too, but with Cortana being the tip of Microsoft’s AI push, the fact that only 28 percent of Windows 10 users tap into the digital assistant feels a bit disappointing, and doubly so when you consider that Cortana replaced Windows 10’s default search option. Microsoft isn’t shying away from Cortana, though, which we’ll get into later.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0015-0158/173680-1-eng-GB/f0015-012.jpg\" width=\"591\" height=\"320\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0015-01\" title=\"f0015-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n <span class=\"credit\">\nIMAGES: MICROSOFT</span></figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>Windows 10 Fall Creators Update</b></h3><p>The biggest news for consumers from Build 2017 is the announcement of the aptly (if inelegantly) named Windows 10 Fall Creators Update.

Timeline captures everything you’re doing on a PC at a given moment, letting you jump back into apps and files easily. Clipboard lets you use the cloud to copy and paste across devices (even though basic copy-pasting is unreliable at best on Windows 10). OneDrive on Demand mimics Windows 8.1’s OneDrive placeholders, showing online-only files in your local file system. Finally, “pick up where you left off,” originally teased for April’s update, allows you to seamlessly continue editing files as you hop among devices.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0016-0162/173673-1-eng-GB/f0016-012.jpg\" width=\"251\" height=\"509\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0016-01\" title=\"f0016-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>Timeline in action.</b></p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>Timeline</b></h3><p>You summon it by opening Windows 10’s task switcher interface, and it shows a history of all your activity in supported apps in reverse chronological order.

A particularly nifty touch: Your activity in supported apps also appears in your Windows 10 Timeline, no matter which device you were using.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0017-0144/173659-1-eng-GB/f0017-012.jpg\" width=\"591\" height=\"331\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0017-01\" title=\"f0017-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>Microsoft’s infatuation with</b> Linux continues.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>More Linux love</b></h3><p>The Windows 10 Anniversary Update added a Linux subsystem that brought Ubuntu’s Bash shell to Microsoft’s operating system, and the Fall update is adding support for SUSE and Fedora Linux to the mix.</p>\n<p>Rather than advancing the current arcane workaround to enable Linux subsystem support, Microsoft’s instead working to migrate the process to the Windows Store, with individual listings for each separate Linux distro.</p>\n<p>That’s just a taste of what’s new. Read PCWorld’s Windows 10 Fall Creators Update coverage (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/w10fallcu\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/w10fallcu</a>) for the full scoop.</p>\n<h3><b>Story Remix</b></h3><p>As part of the Fall Creators Update, Microsoft’s also rolling out a new app called Story Remix that’s basically Movie Maker on steroids. Story Remix uses Microsoft’s machine learning chops to automatically create highlight reels from your pictures and videos, intelligently adding in transitions, music, and more.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0018-0157/173652-1-eng-GB/f0018-012.jpg\" width=\"590\" height=\"331\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0018-01\" title=\"f0018-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>Story Remix is</b> basically Movie Maker on steroids.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>But the real magic lies in the editing abilities: You can change the music type and tempo or even the “star” of the film, and the app will reorganize the entire film to match the tweaks. What’s more, the app includes Remix 3D integration so you can add 3D digital objects and animations to your video if you want to take a more hands-on approach. In examples, a 3D Tyrannosaurus Rex chased a woman across grass, and a fire effect was added to a soccer ball, flaming and adapting as the ball streaked toward the goal.</p>\n<p>We haven’t tried it ourselves yet, but this app looks seriously impressive—and easy to use. Check out PCWorld’s Story Remix article (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/storyremix\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/storyremix</a>) for details and plenty of pictures of the app in action.</p>\n<h3><b>iTunes in the Windows Store</b></h3><p>Surprise! Apple’s iTunes is coming to the Windows Store (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/ituneswin\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/ituneswin</a>), hot on the heels of the Windows 10 S announcement and Spotify’s embrace of Microsoft’s walled garden. Details are scarce beyond that: Windows chief Terry Myerson says the iTunes app will include Apple Music and “full support for the iPhone,” though he didn’t say what that actually <i>means</i> for a Windows Store app.</p>\n<p>No launch date for the iTunes Windows Store app was revealed.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0019-0145/173645-1-eng-GB/f0019-012.jpg\" width=\"547\" height=\"318\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0019-01\" title=\"f0019-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>Acer’s Mixed Reality</b> Developers Edition headset.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>New mixed reality hardware</b></h3><p>Microsoft also revealed more details about the affordable “mixed reality” Windows VR headsets (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/winvrhdst\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/winvrhdst</a>) originally expected to launch alongside the April Creator’s Update, and now releasing later this year.</p>\n<p>Acer’s been showing off its Mixed Reality Developers Edition headset (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/acerwinvr\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/acerwinvr</a>) for a while, and now it has a price: $299 for the headset alone, or $399 for the headset bundled with new “6 degrees of freedom” (6DOF) motion controllers also announced at Build.</p>\n<p>HP announced a Windows VR developer headset of its own, priced at $329.</p>\n<p>Expect both to launch this summer ahead of a wave of Windows VR headsets scheduled to release in time for the holidays.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0019-0211/173638-1-eng-GB/f0019-022.jpg\" width=\"310\" height=\"341\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0019-02\" title=\"f0019-02\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>Windows VR mixed</b> reality controllers.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>Windows VR controllers</b></h3><p>To the right is what the intial Windows VR mixed reality controllers look like—as if the HTC Vive and Oculus Rift’s bespoke hardware had a love child, basically. PC makers will be able to create custom mixed reality controllers of their own as long as they meet baseline specifications spelled out by Microsoft.</p>\n<h3><b>Cortana vs. Alexa</b></h3><p>That’s not the only new hardware revealed at Build 2017. A wave of Cortana-powered Amazon Echo rivals also burst onto the scene, led by Harman Kardon’s Invoke speaker (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/hkinvoke\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/hkinvoke</a>). HP and Intel also jumped on the Cortana appliance bandwagon (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/cortanaintel\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/cortanaintel</a>). HP is ready to create specific devices, and Intel is devising a reference platform that other manufacturers can use to build hardware of their own.</p>\n<p>These devices will act pretty much as you’d expect. The Harman Kardon Invoke uses Cortana to make Skype audio calls, play music, set reminders, and answer the usual gamut of queries, all controlled with your voice. A new Devices menu being tested in the Cortana mobile app suggests the smart speakers can be connected to Microsoft Groove, iHeartRadio, Pandora, TuneIn, and Spotify.</p>\n<h3><b>Cortana skills</b></h3><p>Cortana will be able to do even more in the future, perhaps. Microsoft also launched a “ Cortana Skills Kit” (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/csk\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/csk</a>) in public preview at Build, which lets developers build Cortana support into their apps. It’s similar to the heavily adopted Alexa skill kit that Amazon offers for Echo devices.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0020-0157/173631-1-eng-GB/f0020-012.jpg\" width=\"462\" height=\"342\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0020-01\" title=\"f0020-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>Microsoft is adding</b> offline folder support to the OneDrive mobile apps.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>OneDrive offline folders</b></h3><p>A complement to the OneDrive on Demand feature coming in the Fall Creators Update, Microsoft’s also adding offline folder support to the OneDrive mobile apps. If you download a folder and make changes while you’re offline, they’ll be uploaded to the cloud the next time your device connects to the Internet.</p>\n<p>You don’t need to wait to start using this, though. OneDrive offline folders are already available for Android to Office 365 Personal and Home subscribers and OneDrive business accounts, with iOS support slated to roll out in “the next few months.” Just click the Parachute icon to save a folder offline.</p>\n<p>Fear not, iPhone users—you aren’t being completely neglected today. Microsoft also announced OneDrive for iMessage, which lets you share OneDrive-stored pictures and documents without leaving your conversation. It’s available now if you snag the latest version of the app and enable the feature.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0021-0153/173624-1-eng-GB/f0021-012.jpg\" width=\"455\" height=\"389\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0021-01\" title=\"f0021-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>The Arccos Caddie</b> system taps into Microsoft’s Azure cloud to quantify your actual golfing history and capabilities.</p>\n <span class=\"credit\">\nIMAGE: ARCCOS</span></figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>Arccos Caddiexs</b></h3><p>Microsoft used a consumer app to show off its big data chops.

around the back nine.</p>\n<p>That’s a useful and practical example of how big data can provide actionable information in the real world—but at $250 for the Arccos 360 hardware, plus a subscription cost for the Caddie app, using the power of the cloud to mimic Tiger Woods isn’t cheap.</p>\n","layout":{},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":1,"link_source":"","competition":[],"flatplan_title":"","notes":"","gutter_credit":"","other":"","image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1496850470.9506","name":"f0014-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0014-0159/173687-1-eng-GB/f0014-012.jpg?t=default_ipad_portrait&ext/f0014-012_default_ipad_portrait.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"768","height":"778","legacy_id":"18244","is_default":true},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1496850470.9506","name":"f0014-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0014-0159/173687-1-eng-GB/f0014-012.jpg?t=default_ipad_landscape&ext/f0014-012_default_ipad_landscape.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"758","height":"768","legacy_id":"18244","is_default":false}],"related_objects":{"image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_9_1496850460.6546","name":"f0021-01","source":"IMAGE:

href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/rwareatk\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/rwareatk</a>), has been infecting computers by exploiting a Windows vulnerability involving the Server Message Block protocol, a file-sharing feature.</p>\n<p>Computers infected with WannaCry will have their data encrypted, and display a ransom note demanding $300 or $600 in bitcoin to free the files.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, Windows 10 customers were not targeted in the most recent attack. In March, Microsoft patched the vulnerability that the ransomware exploits—but only for newer Windows systems. That’s left older Windows machines, or those users who failed to patch newer machines, vulnerable (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/winsrvexp\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/winsrvexp</a>) to the May 12th attack.</p>\n<p>Researchers originally believed the ransomware was spread through attachments in email phishing campaigns. That no longer appears to be the case.</p>\n<p>Once a vulnerable PC becomes infected, the computer will attempt to spread to other machines over the local network as well as over the internet. The ransomware will specifically scan for unpatched machines that have the Server Message Block vulnerability exposed.</p>\n<p>Businesses can prevent this by disabling (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/dissmb\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/dissmb</a>) the Server Message Block protocol in vulnerable PCs. They can also use a firewall to block (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/blkwcry\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/blkwcry</a>)unrecognized internet traffic from accessing the networking ports the Server Message Block uses.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0024-0159/173716-1-eng-GB/f0024-012.jpg\" width=\"516\" height=\"284\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0024-01\" title=\"f0024-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>Infection attempts from</b> the WannaCry ransomware.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>Fortunately, the most recent ransomware attack may have been contained. A security researcher who goes by the name MalwareTech has activated a sort of kill-switch (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/wcrykills\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/wcrykills</a>) in WannaCry that stops it from spreading.</p>\n<p>As a result, over 100,000 new infections were prevented, according to U.K.’s National Cyber Security Centre. But experts also warn that WannaCry’s developers may be working on other versions that won’t be easy to disable.</p>\n<p>“It’s very important everyone understands that all they (the hackers) need to do is change some code and start again. Patch your systems now!” MalwareTech tweeted.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the kill-switch’s activation will provide no relief to existing victims. The ransomware will persist on systems already infected.</p>\n<p>The May 12th ransomware attack appears to have spread mainly in Europe and Asia, with Russia among those nations hardest hit, according to security researchers.</p>\n<p>Security experts are advising victims to wait before paying the ransom. It’s possible that researchers will develop a free solution that can remove the infection.</p>\n","layout":{},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":1,"link_source":"","competition":[],"flatplan_title":"","notes":"","gutter_credit":"","other":"","image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1496850475.1411","name":"f0022-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0022-0151/173730-1-eng-GB/f0022-012.jpg?t=default_ipad_portrait&ext/f0022-012_default_ipad_portrait.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"768","height":"504","legacy_id":"18249","is_default":true},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1496850475.1411","name":"f0022-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0022-0151/173730-1-eng-GB/f0022-012.jpg?t=default_ipad_landscape&ext/f0022-012_default_ipad_landscape.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"1024","height":"672","legacy_id":"18249","is_default":false}],"related_objects":{"image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_2_1496850472.7675","name":"f0024-01","source":"","caption":"<p><b>Infection attempts from</b> the WannaCry ransomware.</p>\n","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0024-0159/173716-1-eng-GB/f0024-012.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"516","height":"284","legacy_id":"18247"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_2_1496850472.7675","name":"f0024-01","source":"","caption":"<p><b>Infection attempts from</b> the WannaCry ransomware.</p>\n","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0024-0159/173716-1-eng-GB/f0024-012.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"516","height":"284","legacy_id":"18247"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_1_1496850473.8837","name":"f0023-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0023-0154/173723-1-eng-GB/f0023-012.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"589","height":"380","legacy_id":"18248"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_1_1496850473.8837","name":"f0023-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0023-0154/173723-1-eng-GB/f0023-012.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"589","height":"380","legacy_id":"18248"}]},"url_alias":"http://pcworld-us.audiencemedia.com","type":"story","order":"2","folio_number":"22","folio_numbers":"22,23,24","pdf_page_index":"22","thumbnail":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0022-0151/173730-1-eng-GB/f0022-012.jpg?t=tablet_story_thumbnail&ext/f0022-012_tablet_story_thumbnail.jpg","color":"FFFFFF","real_id":"18246","main_section_id":"541","ads":[]},{"id":"zinio_365_100340926_1496850477.5164","title":"Wanawiki is the WannaCry fix that might save affected PCs","sub_title":"","author":[{"id":"0","name":"MARK HACHMAN","email":"noreply@audiencemedia.com","is_default":false}],"tag":"","strap_line":"NEWS","intro":"","body":"<p class=\"byline\"><b>BY MARK HACHMAN</b></p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0025-0144/173759-1-eng-GB/f0025-012.jpg\" width=\"592\" height=\"528\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0025-01\" title=\"f0025-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>IF YOU OWN a Windows XP or Windows 7 PC that's been hit by the WannaCry ransomware, there's good news: French researchers have created a software utility called wanawiki that can potentially unlock an infected PC.</p>\n<p>Matt Suiche, the founder of CloudVolumes and Comae, published a blog post (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/wwikidem\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/wwikidem</a>) that describes how Benjamin Delpy's wanawiki tool works: It sniffs out the prime numbers used by the ransomware to reconstruct the key used to encrypt your PC. Once the wanawiki tool (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/wwiki\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/wwiki</a>) is run, the software can basically generate the key, and the tool will then unlock the encypted files.</p>\n<p class=\"pullQuote\">Experts have warned, however, that WannaCry itself isn’t that sophisticated, and further exploitswill spread using a vulnerability released by a group calling themselves the Shadow Brokers.</p>\n<p>There's a catch: To give the tool a chance to reconstruct the key, the infected PC cannot be rebooted. Also, wanawiki needs to be run as soon as possible, because the prime numbers the ransomware uses may be overwritten over time, Suiche wrote. Users with PCs infected by WannaCry need to download the tool, run it, and &quot;pray&quot; the prime numbers haven't been overwritten, according to Suiche.</p>\n<p>Over time, the fix has been proven to work on infected PCs running Windows XP and Windows Server 2003, as well as Windows 7. It's assumed, but not proven, that wanawiki will also unlock PCs running every OS version between Windows XP and Windows 7, including Windows Vista, Suiche wrote. Windows 10 PCs remain unaffected by WannaCry.</p>\n<p>According to Suiche, who collaborated with Delpy on the wanawiki tool, the software recreates the .DKY files that Wannacry looks for and also prevents the creation of new encrypted files. (This GIF file (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/wwikigif\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/wwikigif</a>) shows how the process works.)</p>\n<p>Though reports have claimed that slightly more than 200,000 PCs have been infected, the number has steadily increased in the seven days during which WannaCry has circulated. What makes WannaCry so serious is the type of PCs that have been affected: generally PCs at businesses and public agencies like the U.K.'s National Health Service that spend their budget on technologies to assist patients, rather than IT.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, Microsoft has released its own patch (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/wcrymsp\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/wcrymsp</a>) to thwart WannaCry. Experts have warned, however, that WannaCry itself isn't that sophisticated, and further exploits (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/wcrystart\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/wcrystart</a>) will spread using a vulnerability released by a group calling themselves the Shadow Brokers.</p>\n<p><b>Why this matters:</b> Recently, a group of security experts convened a day-long panel recently to provide advice to consumers on how to combat ransomware (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/fightrware\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/fightrware</a>). One of the steps was to sit tight while experts worked on a solution. That's what makes another step so important: If you've backed up files onto another, disconnected storage medium, you'll be able to recreate at least part of the work that was lost.</p>\n","layout":{},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":1,"link_source":"","competition":[],"flatplan_title":"","notes":"","gutter_credit":"","other":"","image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1496850477.6394","name":"f0025-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0025-0144/173759-1-eng-GB/f0025-012.jpg?t=default_ipad_portrait&ext/f0025-012_default_ipad_portrait.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"768","height":"685","legacy_id":"18252","is_default":true},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1496850477.6394","name":"f0025-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0025-0144/173759-1-eng-GB/f0025-012.jpg?t=default_ipad_landscape&ext/f0025-012_default_ipad_landscape.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"861","height":"768","legacy_id":"18252","is_default":false}],"url_alias":"http://pcworld-us.audiencemedia.com","type":"story","order":"3","folio_number":"25","folio_numbers":"25,26,27","pdf_page_index":"25","thumbnail":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0025-0144/173759-1-eng-GB/f0025-012.jpg?t=tablet_story_thumbnail&ext/f0025-012_tablet_story_thumbnail.jpg","color":"FFFFFF","real_id":"18251","main_section_id":"541","ads":[]},{"id":"zinio_365_100340926_1496850479.5719","title":"Meet Windows Defender Security Center, your PC’s safety belt in the Creators Update","sub_title":"","author":[{"id":"0","name":"IAN PAUL","email":"noreply@audiencemedia.com","is_default":false}],"tag":"","strap_line":"CONSUMER WATCH","intro":"The Creators Update puts antivirus, firewall, and other security features all in one place.","body":"<p class=\"byline\"><b>BY IAN PAUL</b></p>\n<p><b>Make smart purchases, stay safe online.</b></p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0029-0152/173844-1-eng-GB/f0029-012.jpg\" width=\"873\" height=\"491\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0029-01\" title=\"f0029-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div>\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/play/173837-1-eng-GB/play2.jpg\" width=\"42\" height=\"43\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"play\" title=\"play\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>Watch the video at <a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/wdcu\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/wdcu</a></p>\n<p><b>M</b><b>ICROSOFT MADE SOME</b> much needed changes to Windows Defender with the Creators Update (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/cu\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/cu</a>).

   \n    </div><p><b>NOPE, YOU’RE NOT</b> being paranoid. From pickpockets to malware, your Android phone is under siege from all sides. Wily attackers are continually switching up their tactics in hopes of taking control of your device.</p>\n<p>Let’s acknowledge that there’s no foolproof way to protect your Android device from thieves and hackers. Indeed, as a wise technology guru once told me, if a sophisticated crook decides to target your phone, good luck trying to stop them.</p>\n<p>That said, there are plenty of ways to keep your Android handset safe from the most common security threats, all with a minimum of effort. Just as a dead bolt will thwart a casual thief, so will a passcode foil a pickpocket, while the right security settings can keep most malware-infected apps at bay.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0040-0156/173965-1-eng-GB/f0040-012.jpg\" width=\"731\" height=\"344\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0040-01\" title=\"f0040-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>Android’s Smart Lock</b> feature is perfect for users who don’t want to bother with a PIN or a passcode.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>1. Lock your phone (if you haven’t already)</b></h3><p>This seems like a no-brainer, I know, but there are too many Android users toting around unlocked handsets because they’d rather not hassle with a passcode. I sympathize, to be perfectly honest—PINs are annoying, particularly if you’re having to tap one in every time you want to use your own phone.</p>\n<p>If you know a fellow Android user who doesn’t bother to lock their phone, remind them how they’d feel if they left their phone in the back of a taxicab, or if someone snatched their device from their hand. Then gently nudge them to tap Settings &gt; Security &gt; Screen Lock and have them create a PIN—or, if they’re lucky enough to have a phone with a fingerprint reader, scan some fingerprints for touch ID.</p>\n<p>Even better, steer them toward Smart Lock (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/sl\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/sl</a>), the Android feature that lets you unlock your handset with your face, or keep your phone unlocked whenever you’re at home, near a strategically placed NFC sticker, or whenever your device is on your person.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0041-0140/173958-1-eng-GB/f0041-012.jpg\" width=\"731\" height=\"331\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0041-01\" title=\"f0041-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>With the right</b> settings enabled, you can use the Android Device Manager to track your lost phone or even wipe it, if necessary.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>2. Locate and wipe your phone remotely</b></h3><p>OK, so you locked your Android phone with a PIN or Smart Lock but you lost it anyway. Now what? Luckily, you can use the Android Device Manager (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/adm\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/adm</a>) to track your lost device and even wipe it if necessary, but only if you’ve enabled a pair of settings first.</p>\n<p>Tap Settings &gt; Google &gt; Security, the toggle on these two settings: Remotely Locate This Device and Allow Remote Lock And Erase.</p>\n<p>Now, even if your Android phone is lost or stolen, you can still pinpoint its location (as long as it’s got a wireless connection and its battery holds out) and wipe its storage, including all your sensitive data.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0041-024/173951-1-eng-GB/f0041-022.jpg\" width=\"428\" height=\"333\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0041-02\" title=\"f0041-02\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>As long as</b> you leave the Unknown Sources setting disabled, apps from shady third-party sites won’t be able to install themselves on your Android device.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>3. Make sure Unknown Sources setting is disabled</b></h3><p>So much for physical threats to your Android phone—now, let’s move on to something trickier, starting with malicious apps.</p>\n<p>Google does its best to make sure the apps on the Google Play store are free from malware, but it can’t protect you from apps on third-party app stores or websites.</p>\n<p>Now, in some cases, third-party app stores will be totally legit—take Amazon’s app store, for example. In other cases, though, you might be dealing with an app store that’s a lot sketchier than Amazon’s. Even worse, you might encounter a website that tries to install an app on your phone without your permission.</p>\n<p>Luckily, Android has a setting that blocks any and all apps that aren’t from the official Google Play app store. Tap Settings &gt; Security, then toggle off the Unknown sources setting. You can always turn the Unknown sources setting back on to install an app from, say, the Amazon app store, but remember to turn the setting off again once you’re done.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0042-0157/173944-1-eng-GB/f0042-012.jpg\" width=\"731\" height=\"397\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0042-01\" title=\"f0042-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>Android can keep</b> an eye on your installed apps to check for any suspicious activity.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>4. Let Android scan and verify your apps</b></h3><p>Even with Google busily screening the apps in the Google Play store, there’s always a chance that a malicious app slips through the cracks. With the right setting enabled, your Android phone can periodically scan your installed apps for malware.</p>\n<p>Tap Settings &gt; Google &gt; Security &gt; Verify Apps, then switch on the Scan Device For Security Threats setting. Once you do, Android will keep an eye on your apps and flag any app that’s up to no good.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0043-0141/173937-1-eng-GB/f0043-012.jpg\" width=\"536\" height=\"371\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0043-01\" title=\"f0043-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>Keeping your Android</b> device updated with the latest security patches is one of the easiest—and best—ways to protect your phone from hackers.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>5. Keep your phone updated</b></h3><p>Hackers are continually changing up their strategies when it comes to cracking Android’s security features—and as they do, Google keeps releasing security updates to patch the latest known vulnerabilities.</p>\n<p>That’s why it’s critical that you keep your Android device updated with the latest patches. If you don’t, you’re essentially leaving your phone wide open to attack.</p>\n<p>Your Android phone should prompt you whenever there’s a new update to install, or tap Settings &gt; About Phone &gt; System Updates to check for an update manually.</p>\n<h3><b>6. Turn on Chrome’s Safe Browsing feature</b></h3><p>Malicious apps aren’t the only online threat your Android phone will encounter. The web is rife with malicious sites that might try to steal your personal data via a “phishing” attack, or surreptitiously download a harmful app onto your handset.</p>\n<p>The good news is that Chrome for Android boasts a Safe Browsing mode that’ll warn you of any sites suspected of nefarious activity. The warning will give you a chance to back away before you expose your Android phone to a deceptive or dangerous site.</p>\n<p>To activate Chrome’s Safe Browsing feature, just fire up the browser, tap the three-dot menu button in the top corner of the screen, tap Settings &gt; Privacy, then make sure the Safe Browsing setting is checked.</p>\n","layout":{},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":1,"link_source":"","competition":[],"flatplan_title":"","notes":"","gutter_credit":"","other":"","image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1496850504.8205","name":"f0039-01","source":"IMAGE:

about streaming channel bundles such as Sling TV, PlayStation Vue, and the new YouTube TV, I have little interest in using them personally.</p>\n<p>Most of my TV consumption comes from Netflix, Amazon Prime, and HBO, all of which are available without a traditional channel bundle. As such, I’ve established a viewing pattern that largely avoids advertisements, is highly flexible, and is much cheaper than cable. Eight years after cutting cable TV, I don’t feel compelled to tack on a big bundle of streaming TV channels.</p>\n<p>With so many new bundles emerging—including an upcoming Hulu bundle and rumored packages from Comcast and Verizon—it’s easy to assume you need one to cut the cord. (I’ve even defended these bundles (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/bun\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/bun</a>) as a potential alternative to cable.) But there’s also a counterargument: By sacrificing traditional TV channels, you may achieve a purer—and arguably, better—form of cord cutting.</p>\n<p class=\"pullQuote\">The biggest problem with streaming bundles is the baggage they carry, thanks to TV networks desperate to keep old business models intact.</p>\n<h3><b>Same channels, new headaches</b></h3><p>The biggest problem with streaming bundles is the baggage they carry, thanks to TV networks desperate to keep old business models intact.</p>\n<p>Advertisements, for instance, are a big part of traditional TV channels, and they’re even harder to avoid with streaming bundles. Some channels don’t let you fast forward after pausing live TV, so you can’t easily skip commercial breaks, and some on-demand programming includes mandatory ad viewing.</p>\n<p>While DVR might seem like the answer to these problems, streaming bundles tend to load their DVRs with stipulations. PlayStation Vue’s DVR service is free, but it only stores programming for 28 days. Sling TV’s beta DVR service (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/bdvr\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/bdvr</a>) has no time limits, but carries a $5-per-month surcharge. YouTube TV stores programs for nine months, but forces users to watch commercials for some shows. DirecTV Now doesn’t offer DVR at all. And none of these services include convenient ad-skipping features that are available on some cable and satellite boxes, such TiVo’s SkipMode and Dish’s AutoHop.</p>\n<p>Streaming bundles, meanwhile, remain fairly inflexible in terms of channel lineups. Networks, for the most part, still insist on selling all their channels together, which means entire networks get left out of each bundle to keep prices down. YouTube TV, for example, doesn’t have Viacom or Turner channels, Sling TV doesn’t have channels from Discovery, Sony doesn’t have channels from Viacom, and so on. Picking one of these services might save you money compared with cable (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/save\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/save</a>), but you still might end up with more channels than you need, and without some of the ones you want.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0049-0141/174058-1-eng-GB/f0049-012.jpg\" width=\"728\" height=\"407\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0049-01\" title=\"f0049-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>Sling TV’s public</b> DVR beta costs $5-per-month extra.</p>\n <span class=\"credit\">\nIMAGE: SLING TV</span></figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>Free your mind</b></h3><p>The alternative approach is to avoid traditional TV channels entirely. By venturing outside the cable system, you’ll get fewer hassles and more flexibility, and you might even find that the content is better.</p>\n<p>Don’t want to pay for a service that has ads? You’ll find plenty of services to meet that need.

The GTX 1080 Ti SC2 hums along at a 1,556MHz <i>base</i> clock and 1,670MHz boost clock. That’s a healthy 88MHz leap over the GTX 1080 Ti Founders Edition boost clock—heck, the EVGA card’s base clock is a mere 26MHz away from the stock version’s boost clock. The numbers aren’t as concrete as they seem, however, as the GTX 1080 Ti regularly surpasses its rated boost clock anyway. Before performing any additional overclocking, we saw EVGA’s card hit clock speeds up to 1,850MHz in some games, depending on what was happening on-screen.</p>\n<p>The memory’s untouched compared to the reference version, with a borderline excessive 11GB of GDDR5X of onboard RAM. The cooling solution is anything but.</p>\n<p>You’ll notice EVGA’s new shroud design first. With the GTX 1080 Ti lineup, the company’s ditched the solid exterior found in its customized GTX 1080 models (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/1080ftwrev\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/1080ftwrev</a>) for a porous new aesthetic that shows the beefy heatsink lurking underneath. The look’s been somewhat divisive in forums but I dig it, not least of which because it shows the true star of the show here: EVGA’s ambitious iCX cooling setup.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0057-0147/174248-1-eng-GB/f0057-012.jpg\" width=\"560\" height=\"372\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0057-01\" title=\"f0057-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n <span class=\"credit\">\nIMAGE: BRAD CHACOS/IDG</span></figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>EVGA GeForce GTX 1080 Ti SC2</b></h3><h4><b>AT A GLANCE</b></h4><p>The GTX 1080 Ti SC2 uses EVGA’s revolutionary iCX cooling technology to make the most potent consumer graphics card in the world even better.

Graphics cards have traditionally only featured a single temperature sensor, monitoring the GPU processor itself. EVGA’s iCX loads the card with not one, not two, but <i>nine</i> additional sensors that also monitor the rear of the GPU, the onboard memory modules, and the power controllers. Virtually every aspect of your graphics card is tracked.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0058-0160/174234-1-eng-GB/f0058-012.jpg\" width=\"873\" height=\"453\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0058-01\" title=\"f0058-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>How EVGA’s iCX</b> cooling technology works.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>But iCX does more than simply track temperatures. It uses that comprehensive data to control the speeds of the dual fans independently, with the leftmost fan responding to the GPU temperature, and the right-side fan adjusting speeds to keep the memory and PWMs cool. If the memory’s heating up rapidly but the GPU itself is staying relatively cool, as can happen with the Furmark stress test, the dedicated GPU fan maintains a slower, quieter speed, while the memory fan ramps up.</p>\n<p>EVGA’s tweaked the VRM heatpipe design on iCX-equipped GTX 1080 Ti cards as well, to help keep temperatures even lower.</p>\n<p>You can monitor your temperatures sensor-by-sensor in EVGA’s Precision XOC (<a href=\"http://evga.com/precisionxoc\" target=\"_self\">evga.com/precisionxoc</a>) software, or just by glancing at the graphics card in your case. Three RGB lights above the EVGA GTX 1080 Ti SC2’s logo on the card’s edge indicate how hot your GPU, PWMs, and memory are, respectively. As components heat up, the individual lights change color (not that you’ll have to worry about it much with this card). Precision XOC lets you customize the colors of the EVGA logo as well as the RGB indicators.</p>\n<p>It feels like the future of cooling, and it’s stunningly effective in practice. It’s nice seeing RGB lights being used to practical effects, as well. Most custom GTX 1080 Ti cards released thus far have used thicker 2.5- or 3-slot designs to keep the GPU tamed, but EVGA’s card sticks to a traditional 2-slot size, so it’ll be interesting to see how iCX holds up in games.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0059-0147/174227-1-eng-GB/f0059-012.jpg\" width=\"591\" height=\"591\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0059-01\" title=\"f0059-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>The copper VRM</b> heatpipe integrated in the GTX 1080 Ti’s redesigned baseplate.</p>\n <span class=\"credit\">\nIMAGES: EVGA</span></figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>As far as the rest of the card goes, the EVGA GTX 1080 Ti SC2 features a sturdy backplate, as you’d expect in a graphics card this pricey.

But look at those 1440p results! They’re virtually identical between the two cards, and remained so after several tests.</p>\n<p>That’s because the EVGA GTX 1080 Ti SC2 is so fast, <i>Ashes</i> becomes CPU-bound rather than GPU-bound at 1440p/High—the first time we’ve seen a graphics card max out our system’s capabilities. The SC2’s extra oomph pushes it over the edge, as confirmed by checking the game’s deeper metrics, which showed that only about 5 percent of heavy- and medium-batch frames were GPU-bound. To be fair, the 8-core Core i7-5960X in our test system runs at modest 3GHz stock speeds, but it’s still a milestone. We’ll be making some changes soon to prevent it from happening again.</p>\n<h3><b>Synthetics, power, heat, overclocking</b></h3><p>We also tested the EVGA GTX 1080 Ti SC2 and its rivals using 3DMark’s highly respected DX11 Fire Strike and Fire Strike Ultra synthetic benchmarks, as well as 3DMark’s Time Spy benchmark, which tests DirectX 12 performance at 2560x1440 resolution.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0067-0156/174143-1-eng-GB/f0067-012.jpg\" width=\"591\" height=\"308\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0067-01\" title=\"f0067-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div>\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0068-0156/174136-1-eng-GB/f0068-012.jpg\" width=\"591\" height=\"309\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0068-01\" title=\"f0068-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>Everything falls about where you’d expect based on prior performance results.</p>\n<h3><b>Power</b></h3><p>We test power under load by plugging the entire system into a Watts Up meter, running the intensive <i>Division</i> benchmark at 4K resolution, and noting the peak power draw.

Without tweaking the power limit—an important note—I was able to achieve a +80MHz offset on the card’s GPU clocks, which resulted in actual clock speeds of 1,910MHz to 1,987MHz in games depending on the resolution and intensity of the scene. Memory overclocks hit +300MHz without a hitch, and could’ve gone further if I had time to keep stepping up the frequency and checking stability.</p>\n<p>Even overclocked, EVGA’s aggressive fan curve kept temperatures in the mid- to high-50s, Celsius. The combination of the overclock and using the aggressive fan curve also didn’t use much more power than the stock configuration, at 314W instead of 303W.</p>\n<p>This hasty overclock added a few more frames’ worth of performance in the handful of games I was able to test at 4K/Ultra.</p>\n<p>The extra oomph provided by the overclock resulted in a 9.9 percent average frame rate increase compared to the stock GTX 1080 Ti Founders Edition, and no doubt with time I could’ve pushed it even further.

A quick, basic overclock nearly doubled the performance gain, though overclocking’s always subject to the whims of the silicon lottery.</p>\n<p>The real star here is EVGA’s unique iCX cooling solution. I was a fan (har har) when EVGA debuted iCX, and the refinements in the GTX 1080 Ti SC2 really make it shine. The card runs cool as a cucumber and quiet as a mouse with its default fan profile, and that’s all the more impressive when you consider that the EVGA GTX 1080 Ti SC2’s a standard 2-slot size. Most of the other custom GTX 1080 Ti cards released expanded to bulkier 2.5- and 3-slot thicknesses to accommodate the heat of this potent GPU.</p>\n<p>If you’re really looking to crank overclocks as far as possible, you might want to wait for the release of EVGA’s flagship GTX 1080 Ti FTW3 flagship, which is also imbued with iCX. That card offers slightly higher out-of-the-clock speeds but really caters to overclockers by swapping out the secondary 6-pin power connector with another 8-pin connector, upgrading the power phases to a 10+2 arrangement, and adding a second BIOS. It costs $30 more, though.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0072-0154/174101-1-eng-GB/f0072-012.jpg\" width=\"785\" height=\"524\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0072-01\" title=\"f0072-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div>\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0073-0161/174094-1-eng-GB/f0073-012.jpg\" width=\"873\" height=\"586\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0073-01\" title=\"f0073-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>You can’t be disappointed with a cool, quiet, eminently configurable graphics card that pushes performance to the literal brink in a game like <i>Ashes,</i> though. The GTX 1080 Ti SC2’s performance bump and vastly improved cooling solution make it well worth the $20 premium over a Founders Edition card. EVGA’s card is easily the fastest graphics card to ever cross our labs. Don’t hesitate to buy it if you’re gaming at 4K resolution, or 1440p at a high refresh rate.</p>\n<p>And we won’t hesitate to upgrade our testing system. Look for a rebuild before Radeon Vega lands, complete with a new lineup of game benchmarks.</p>\n","layout":{},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":1,"link_source":"","competition":[],"flatplan_title":"","notes":"","gutter_credit":"","other":"","image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1496850540.724","name":"f0055-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0055-0150/174262-1-eng-GB/f0055-012.jpg?t=default_ipad_portrait&ext/f0055-012_default_ipad_portrait.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"768","height":"602","legacy_id":"18317","is_default":true},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1496850540.724","name":"f0055-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0055-0150/174262-1-eng-GB/f0055-012.jpg?t=default_ipad_landscape&ext/f0055-012_default_ipad_landscape.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"980","height":"768","legacy_id":"18317","is_default":false}],"related_objects":{"image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_24_1496850514.8925","name":"f0073-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0073-0161/174094-1-eng-GB/f0073-012.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"873","height":"586","legacy_id":"18293"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_24_1496850514.8925","name":"f0073-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0073-0161/174094-1-eng-GB/f0073-012.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"873","height":"586","legacy_id":"18293"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_23_1496850516.0375","name":"f0072-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0072-0154/174101-1-eng-GB/f0072-012.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"785","height":"524","legacy_id":"18294"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_23_1496850516.0375","name":"f0072-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0072-0154/174101-1-eng-GB/f0072-012.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"785","height":"524","legacy_id":"18294"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_22_1496850517.0396","name":"f0071-01","source":"","caption":"<p><b>Brief

Yes, I’m talking about e-sports. The likes of <i>League of Legends</i>, <i>Dota 2</i>, and <i>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive</i> dominate Twitch and Steam charts alike. There are a lot of reasons for their success, but the fact that they run on virtually any PC doesn’t hurt. Heck, you can even run e-sports games—including <i>Overwatch</i>—on an AMD APU’s integrated graphics (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/amdapu\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/amdapu</a>) if you’re okay with modest frame rates at lower resolutions.</p>\n<p>AMD’s affordable new Radeon RX 550 is designed for folks who want more e-sports eye candy without breaking the bank, at $80 on Newegg (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/rx550ne\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/rx550ne</a>).</p>\n<p>Higher frame rates and resolutions mean you can see more, faster, and that extra performance can spell the difference between winning and losing in the world of competitive gaming. AMD’s latest Radeon lets you crank those graphics settings, and it includes all the helpful ecosystem conveniences found in the rest of the Radeon RX 500-series, such as native broadcasting support with Radeon Crimson ReLive, FreeSync monitor compatibility, and modern media technologies that could make the Radeon RX 550 a hit with home theater PC enthusiasts.</p>\n<p>We haven’t seen a graphics card serve the ultra-budget market in years. But is a graphics card this cut-down worthwhile? Yes…and no.</p>\n<p>Let’s dig in.</p>\n<h3><b>Radeon RX 550</b></h3><h4><b>AT A GLANCE</b></h4><p>The Radeon RX 550 delivers tremendous value to e-sports gamers and home theater PC owners, but high pricing compared to the RX 560 renders it borderline irrelevant.</p>\n<h4><b>PROS</b></h4><p>• Huge e-sports performance leap over integrated graphics</p>\n<p>• Cool and quiet</p>\n<p>• Offers modern ecosystem and media features</p>\n<h4><b>CONS</b></h4><p>• No small form factor versions at launch</p>\n<p>• Priced too high</p>\n<p>$80</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0075-0151/174347-1-eng-GB/f0075-012.jpg\" width=\"96\" height=\"18\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0075-01\" title=\"f0075-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>Meet the Radeon RX 550</b></h3><p>You’ll find all the hard-core technical specs for the Radeon RX 550 in the chart on the next page, but in sum they’re half that of the already modest $100 RX 560, which is launching in early May as the final release in AMD’s new Radeon RX 500 (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/amdrx500\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/amdrx500</a>) series. It’s one-quarter the GPU inside the $170 Radeon RX 570 (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/amdrx570\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/amdrx570</a>).</p>\n<p>The Radeon RX 550’s Polaris GPU packs a mere 8 compute units and 512 stream processors, but you don’t need much horsepower to drive e-sports or home theater PCs. It hums along at a 1,100MHz base/1,183MHz boost clock, married to 2GB of GDDR5 memory with a 128-bit bus. (4GB models will also be available in limited numbers.) Those modest internals demand only modest amounts of power, however. The Radeon RX 550 is powered completely via your motherboard’s PCIe slot, with no extra power cables required. That’s a big deal for folks wanting more oomph from an existing PC—likely a sizable portion of this card’s target audience.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0076-0156/174340-1-eng-GB/f0076-012.jpg\" width=\"434\" height=\"481\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0076-01\" title=\"f0076-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>Besides e-sports gaming capabilities, which are bolstered by compatibility with affordable FreeSync variable refresh rate displays, the Radeon RX 550 offers support for modern media technologies.

Heck, it isn’t even as small as most 3GB GeForce GTX 1060 cards. Instead the PowerColor Red Devil Radeon RX 550 uses the same basic cooling solution as PowerColor’s RX 460, with a single fan and a plastic shroud over a small heat sink reminiscent of a stock CPU cooler. That’s not surprising. AMD didn’t create a reference version for any of the Radeon RX 500 series, and with the Radeon RX 550 being so cheap, we’d expect to see a lot of cooler reuse from manufacturers, especially in the first wave of products.</p>\n<p>You’ll find single connections for the aforementioned HDMI and DisplayPorts, as well as DVI-D, which is officially eradicated from AMD’s reference lineup but damned handy for older and entry-level monitors serving this price range.</p>\n<p>Got it? Good. Let’s see how this puppy handles.</p>\n<h3><b>Our test system</b></h3><p>Even though the PowerColor RX 550 is the most entry-level of entry-level video cards released in a long while, we’re still testing it on <i>PCWorld’</i>s dedicated GPU benchmarking PC, which is brimming with high-level hardware to eradicate bottlenecks and show unfettered graphics performance.</p>\n<p>• Intel’s Core i7-5960X with a Corsair Hydro Series H100i closed-loop water cooler ($120 on Amazon, <a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/i75960x\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/i75960x</a>).</p>\n<p>• An Asus X99 Deluxe motherboard ($230 on Amazon, <a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/asusx99\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/asusx99</a>, for an updated version).</p>\n<p>• Corsair’s Vengeance LPX DDR4 memory ($125 on Amazon, <a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/clpx\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/clpx</a>), and 1,200-watt AX1200i power supply ($310 on Amazon, <a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/az1200i\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/az1200i</a>).</p>\n<p>• A 480GB Intel 730 series SSD ($280 on Amazon, <a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/i730\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/i730</a>).</p>\n<p>• Phanteks’ Enthoo Evolv ATX case ($190 on Amazon, <a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/evolvatx\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/evolvatx</a>).</p>\n<p>• Windows 10 Pro ($158 on Amazon, <a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/win10pr\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/win10pr</a>). This review’s going to be a bit unusual, as the stripped-down Radeon RX 550 simply isn’t intended to play AAA games at a decent clip like most graphics cards. It’s designed as a step up from CPU integrated graphics, and heck, it doesn’t even have any direct competition in dedicated graphics. No Nvidia GeForce cards have targeted this segment since 2014’s GT 740, and AMD hasn’t offered a comparable Radeon in the U.S. since the Radeon R7 250 launch in 2013.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0078-0153/174319-1-eng-GB/f0078-012.jpg\" width=\"593\" height=\"388\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0078-01\" title=\"f0078-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p>Port report.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div>\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0079-0156/174312-1-eng-GB/f0079-012.jpg\" width=\"492\" height=\"389\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0079-01\" title=\"f0079-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>So instead of our usual benchmarking suite, I turned to some of the top e-sports games to test the Radeon RX 550, taking advantage of the replay feature in <i>Dota 2</i> and <i>League of Legends</i>.

Here are the options I used for <i>Dota 2</i>, which resulted in an attractive overall image:</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, I tested <i>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive</i> using the FPS Benchmark mod from the Steam Workshop.

But I tested an AMD A10-7860K APU-powered machine with relatively strong integrated graphics last year, and while it was definitely capable of playing e-sports games, it required some severe compromises. You can see on the chart (see previous page) how that PC held up in the games we’re testing. Take particular note of the resolution and graphics settings listed next to each game, which were the combination required to get the games running close to the hallowed 60 frames per second standard.</p>\n<p>By comparison, the PowerColor Radeon RX 550 fared in those same games (see above). All games were tested at 1900x1200 resolution and High graphics settings. We also tested a pair of traditional AAA games at Low graphics settings to see how the card rolls outside of e-sports.</p>\n<p>As you can see, the RX 550 delivers a vastly superior experience to even the Radeon integrated graphics in a pricier AMD APU, surpassing 100 fps at far higher resolutions and graphics settings in the tested games. Not too shabby! Also not too shabby: the Radeon RX 550’s ability to handle <i>The Division</i> and <i>Rise of the Tomb Raider,</i> two of the most gorgeous games in recent memory, albeit at low settings. You’re definitely going to want a more potent graphics card if you plan on playing anything but e-sports regularly. But the Radeon RX 550 can do in a low-quality pinch.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0081-0159/174291-1-eng-GB/f0081-012.jpg\" width=\"680\" height=\"306\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0081-01\" title=\"f0081-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>Even better, this modest card uses modest amounts of power and generates modest amounts of heat.

The benchmarks say yes, unequivocally, if your usage falls into its purview.</p>\n<p>If you’re using a PC with integrated graphics and want to supercharge your e-sports experience (and dabble in other games) without topping $100, the Radeon RX 550 definitely delivers. The difference in performance is night and day, and with Polaris’s deep encoding support, you’ll be able to stream your adventures to Twitch with no problem—and streaming functionality’s built right into AMD’s Radeon Software Crimson. It’s like this card was made for e-sports or something.</p>\n<p>There’s no reason to opt for a pricier 4GB version of the Radeon RX 550 once those become available, as none of the gaming this card is meant for would push the memory that hard. But if you wind up upgrading your monitor at some point down the line, a high refresh-rate FreeSync display like ViewSonic’s 24-inch, 75Hz VX2457-mhd ($140 on Amazon, <a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/vx2457amz\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/vx2457amz</a>) would be a splendid, buttery-smooth companion.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, the Radeon RX 550’s modern media features indeed make it an intriguing option for home theater PCs. Of course, many are built to be smaller rigs, something less obtrusive for the living room.</p>\n<p class=\"pullQuote\">Competitive gaming is only getting more popular, and extremely budget-focused graphics card buyers have been woefully underserved by AMD and Nvidia for years.</p>\n<p>If your needs are compatible with the first wave of full-height cards, swell! If not, here’s hoping the Radeon RX 550 indeed starts rolling out in low-profile and (maybe, please?) single-slot variants. It’s a natural fit for that form factor—and quiet as hell.</p>\n<p>The only fly in the ointment? Price. At $80, the Radeon RX 550 certainly isn’t expensive, and it’s more affordable than Nvidia’s ancient $100 GT 740 was—but it’s only $20 cheaper than the $100 Radeon RX 560 cards coming in early May. And if you remember back to the beginning of this review, a Radeon RX 550 is half a RX 560 under the hood. A 20 percent discount for 50 percent less performance (roughly) doesn’t sit right, especially since the extra oomph provided by the Radeon RX 460 (and soon the RX 560) enables solid, near-console-quality gaming at 1080p resolution.</p>\n<p>Sure, if you know you’re only going to use the Radeon RX 550 for e-sports or watching 4K videos, the card lets you save $20 off the price of the RX 460 or RX 560. Most people should just buy the $100 card though. Which is why I’m so disappointed here.</p>\n<p>The Radeon RX 550 is nowhere near as versatile as the RX 460. I actually consider that a great thing. Competitive gaming is only getting more popular, and extremely budget-focused graphics card buyers have been woefully underserved by AMD and Nvidia for years.</p>\n<p>The stellar e-sports performance of this GPU excited me during benchmarking—when I assumed it would cost somewhere between $60 and $70. Itches that have been lingering for years would finally be scratched! Instead, at $80, there’s little reason to buy it over an RX 460. We’re back at square one.</p>\n<p>I still really, <i>really</i> like the Radeon RX 550 and its laser-focus on HTPCs and competitive gaming. It could’ve been something special if it was just a bit cheaper. But as it stands there’s little reason to buy it unless prices shift downward by $10 or $20. Cost is very important in the sub- $100 market, even if it’s been largely underserved until now.</p>\n","layout":{},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":1,"link_source":"","competition":[],"flatplan_title":"","notes":"","gutter_credit":"","other":"","image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1496850553.4918","name":"f0074-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0074-0163/174354-1-eng-GB/f0074-012.jpg?t=default_ipad_portrait&ext/f0074-012_default_ipad_portrait.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"768","height":"512","legacy_id":"18329","is_default":true},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1496850553.4918","name":"f0074-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0074-0163/174354-1-eng-GB/f0074-012.jpg?t=default_ipad_landscape&ext/f0074-012_default_ipad_landscape.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"1024","height":"683","legacy_id":"18329","is_default":false}],"related_objects":{"image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_9_1496850542.9699","name":"f0081-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0081-0159/174291-1-eng-GB/f0081-012.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"680","height":"306","legacy_id":"18320"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_9_1496850542.9699","name":"f0081-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0081-0159/174291-1-eng-GB/f0081-012.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"680","height":"306","legacy_id":"18320"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_8_1496850544.0206","name":"f0080-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0080-0154/174298-1-eng-GB/f0080-012.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"680","height":"366","legacy_id":"18321"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_8_1496850544.0206","name":"f0080-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0080-0154/174298-1-eng-GB/f0080-012.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"680","height":"366","legacy_id":"18321"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_7_1496850545.0981","name":"f0079-02","source":"","caption":"<p><b>The

They’re the order of the day, with component prices reaching new lows and non-gaming companies putting out quality products at a bargain. A few years back we were hyped about Lenovo’s selling its Y50 for $1,200. Now? You can pick up a Dell Inspiron 15 7000 (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/insp157k\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/insp157k</a>) Gaming notebook for $850. That’s with a 1050 Ti thrown in.</p>\n<p>Sure, it might not be the most powerful gaming laptop, but getting a system with a dedicated graphics card at this price is <i>crazy</i>. And if it weren’t for one major caveat, the Inspiron 15 7000 Gaming would be an insane deal.</p>\n<h3><b>Dell Inspiron 15 7000 Gaming</b></h3><h4><b>AT A GLANCE</b></h4><p>It’s not the most powerful gaming laptop ever made, but an i5 and a 1050 Ti for only $850?

Dell put it into a fairly standard chassis, about an inch thick and with the iconic Dell logo on the outside. The fan vents do sport some flashy grills, but otherwise this Inspiron looks like an enterprise laptop. You could take it to work, use it in meetings, and people would say “Ah yes, a Dell. Clearly that person is entering data into spreadsheets.” At least, that’s what I assume.</p>\n<p>That is, if you order the black version. Ours came in bright red (or “Beijing Red” as Dell puts it), and it’s much flashier than it needs to be. If you want this for gaming on the down-low, it’s better stick to something more traditional.</p>\n<p>While the chassis is inoffensive, that doesn’t hold true once you lift the lid. The Inspiron 15 7000 Gaming has only one real design issue, and it’s the screen.</p>\n<p>Ah yes, the screen—bane of inexpensive laptops the world over. We had the same complaint about the aforementioned Y50 a few years back. It had excellent internals at fire-sale prices, but with a screen seemingly recycled out of the trash.</p>\n<p>The Inspiron 15 7000 Gaming follows in those same footsteps. Its screen is <i>ugly</i>. We’re talking light bleed on all four edges, a viewing angle of roughly 15 degrees, muted color reproduction, and what I can only describe as “fuzziness”—even running at the laptop’s full 1920x1080 resolution, smaller text looks slightly blurry and indistinct. The display is only 15.6 inches, not a 30-inch monstrosity, so there’s no reason it should look fuzzy. Yet here we are.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0086-0156/174432-1-eng-GB/f0086-012.jpg\" width=\"873\" height=\"544\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0086-01\" title=\"f0086-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>It’s the only beef I have with this laptop. Appearance? Fine. Power? Fine—we’ll get to that in a second. Price? Excellent. But this screen is simply awful, and I can’t stress that enough. It’s a shame, whether you’d use this Inspiron as a cheap gaming laptop or for getting work done. In fact, the latter makes this notebook a particularly hard sell, given the number of quality work-oriented 15-inch laptops in the same price range.</p>\n<p>Everything else offers a much better experience. The keyboard and trackpad are both plain but serviceable. The keyboard offers single-color red backlighting, which is useful, if not very bright.</p>\n<p>The trackpad is slightly offset to the left, centered under the main keyboard. I find that design a bit annoying and cramped, especially for gaming, but I assume in most situations you’d hook up a mouse for anything serious. The trackpad is responsive though, with good sensitivity out of the box. I was impressed, given the myriad troubles I’ve had previously with trackpads on inexpensive laptops.</p>\n<p>Ports include a lock slot, barrel charging, single USB 3.0, and SD card reader on the left, and an ethernet jack, HDMI out, two more USB 3.0 ports, and a headphone/mic jack on the right.</p>\n<p>While we’re on the topic: You’ll want to use that headphone jack. The Inspiron 15 7000 Gaming’s built-in audio is as good as you’d expect from an $850 laptop—or in other words, not that good at all. The speakers work in a pinch, but any gaming will beg for decent headphones.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0087-0158/174425-1-eng-GB/f0087-012.jpg\" width=\"873\" height=\"488\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0087-01\" title=\"f0087-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>Performance</b></h3><p>Under the hood, this Inspiron is pretty damn solid. Again, it’s not a $3,000 gaming beast, but our review unit came packed with a quad-core Intel Core i5-7300HQ clocked at 2.5GHz, Nvidia GTX 1050 Ti, 256GB SSD, and 8GB of RAM. It’s a modest machine, but even “modest” is surprisingly powerful nowadays.</p>\n<p>After running through our usual bevy of benchmarks, I came away impressed with the results. In last year’s <i>Rise of the Tomb Raider</i>, for instance, the Inspiron 15 7000 Gaming still managed 44.6 frames per second on Very High settings. Drop down to High and you get 52.8fps.</p>\n<p>Is that the smooth 60 frames per second at 1080p that PC gamers crave? No, but it’s definitely better than I expected from a GTX 1050 Ti in one of 2016’s prettiest games.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0088-0160/174418-1-eng-GB/f0088-012.jpg\" width=\"679\" height=\"607\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0088-01\" title=\"f0088-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>Head back a few years and the scene looks even better, with the Inspiron 15 7000 Gaming pumping out 56.8fps in Middle-earth: <i>Shadow of Mordor</i> on Ultra with the 4K texture pack installed.</p>\n<p>That said, there are better laptops out there. Even moving up to a GTX 1060-equipped machine can score a big bump in performance. As you can see in the charts, the GTX 1060-equipped Alienware 13 managed 87.3fps in <i>Shadow of Mordor</i> and 59.1fps in <i>Rise of the Tomb Raider</i>. Jumping up one more level to the HP Omen 17 and its GTX 1070 netted 118.9fps and 95.5fps, respectively.

It put up a score of 3,486 in PCMark 8’s Work Conventional test at 1080p, which compares favorably to the 1060-equipped Acer Predator 15.</p>\n<p>We also put it through our Handbrake encoding benchmark, which involves converting a 30GB MKV file to a smaller MP4 to the Android Tablet preset. It’s a CPU-focused test, and the results can also reveal how a system handles itself under heavy thermal load. In this particular benchmark, the more modest Core i5-7300HQ did take a clear second place to the Core i7-6700HQ laptops we’ve tested. This new midrange quad-core took an hour and six minutes compared to 50 to 55 minute range of the Core i7 quad-cores.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0090-0162/174404-1-eng-GB/f0090-012.jpg\" width=\"680\" height=\"525\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0090-01\" title=\"f0090-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>That’s absolutely fine, though. You likely won’t be using this machine for any heavy content creation, and we didn’t see any major issues with throttling of performance.</p>\n<p>If that still gets you down, cheer up—the Dell has one huge advantage, and that’s in battery life. Typically, gaming laptops have terrible battery life, even when they’re running off of integrated graphics. The Inspiron 15 7000 Gaming, however, averaged about eight hours in our battery rundown test.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0091-0156/174397-1-eng-GB/f0091-012.jpg\" width=\"679\" height=\"689\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0091-01\" title=\"f0091-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>Our benchmark is performed by setting the screen brightness between 250 and 260 nits and audio volume to 50 percent, then plugging in a set of earbuds and playing a 4K video file on loop in Windows 10’s Movies &amp; TV app until the machine dies.

I forgot about another common problem with inexpensive laptops: preinstalled bloatware. And wow, Dell has packed it into every nook and cranny here.</p>\n<p>You’ll find the usual offenders, of course—e.g., McAfee. Get ready to wipe that and a couple of random games off your machine and never look back.</p>\n<p>But it’s Dell’s own programs I actually find most annoying. They interrupt you seemingly every 15 minutes to let you know about some other special offer, some bit of software you need to register, some crapola you don’t want and don’t need. There’s a whole <i>folder</i> of stuff here: Dell Customer Connect, Dell Digital Delivery, Dell Notifications (an independent notification system!), Dell Update, SupportAssist, and more.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0093-0150/174383-1-eng-GB/f0093-012.jpg\" width=\"557\" height=\"314\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0093-01\" title=\"f0093-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>Get ready to</b> hate this screen.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>It’s frustrating. Frankly, I’ve gotten used to the experiences offered by Razer, Origin, and even the higher-end laptops from MSI and Asus. Get the laptop, sign in, and... nothing. It’s clean. Razer might prompt you with some of its software—Synapse or what have you—the first time you log on, but you can tell it to leave you alone and then enjoy peace and quiet.</p>\n<p>These lower-end laptops come crammed with unnecessary software and <i>remind you of that fact</i> every damn day. It’s a mess and just an awful user experience for anyone without the patience to seek and destroy all the offending programs. It’s one more thing to keep in mind before you purchase an Inspiron 15 7000 Gaming: The price is excellent, but the hidden cost is in the bloatware.</p>\n<h3><b>Bottom line</b></h3><p>That price is so, so excellent though. I am really and truly amazed at the gaming performance you can get from a sub-$1,000 laptop nowadays, and doubly amazed that this machine comes from Dell.</p>\n<p>Granted, it’s not incredibly powerful nor future-proof. But it’ll play most of today’s games at decent enough quality, and will definitely play games like <i>League of Legends</i>, <i>Dota 2</i>, <i>Rocket League</i>, <i>CSGO</i>, <i>Team Fortress 2</i>, and <i>Overwatch</i>—you know, some of the most popular multiplayer games of the day. Hook up a mouse and you’re ready to game on the go, all for $850. Not bad at all.</p>\n","layout":{},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":1,"link_source":"","competition":[],"flatplan_title":"","notes":"","gutter_credit":"","other":"","image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1496850565.2363","name":"f0084-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0084-0164/174446-1-eng-GB/f0084-012.jpg?t=default_ipad_portrait&ext/f0084-012_default_ipad_portrait.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"768","height":"494","legacy_id":"18341","is_default":true},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1496850565.2363","name":"f0084-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0084-0164/174446-1-eng-GB/f0084-012.jpg?t=default_ipad_landscape&ext/f0084-012_default_ipad_landscape.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"1024","height":"658","legacy_id":"18341","is_default":false}],"related_objects":{"image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_9_1496850555.379","name":"f0093-01","source":"","caption":"<p><b>Get

FINALLY beat Apple at its own game.</p>\n<p>While the Galaxy S has been regarded for years as the best Android phone money can buy (at least until the Pixel, <a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/pixelrev\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/pixelrev</a>, came around), it’s always existed in the iPhone’s lengthy shadow. Even with a higher market share, a dominant OS, and a years-long lead on features like screen size and water resistance, the Galaxy S has stayed just out of reach of the iPhone zeitgeist. No matter how much it tried to create its own end-to-end experience, Apple fans saw it as a copycat and Android enthusiasts lamented its aggressive TouchWiz interface overhaul.</p>\n<p>All that has changed with the Galaxy S8+ (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/ss8pls\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/ss8pls</a>). With a stunning design that absolutely needs to be seen and a harmonious integration between hardware and OS, the Galaxy S8+ is the first phone in a long while that truly changes the conversation and resets our expectations. It might be a touch hyperbolic to compare it to the original iPhone, but it’s hard to deny that the S8+ is a watershed moment for modern smartphones, despite the tragic and confounding placement of its fingerprint sensor. After years of barely-distinguishable rectangles jammed with features of dubious usefulness, Samsung has brought something entirely new to the table.</p>\n<p>And when the iPhone 8 comes out in September, people might not look at it quite so admiringly.</p>\n<p>Most of what you read here also applies to the smaller Galaxy S8, which we reviewed (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/ss8rev\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/ss8rev</a>).</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0095-0146/174671-1-eng-GB/f0095-012.jpg\" width=\"619\" height=\"382\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0095-01\" title=\"f0095-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>The Galaxy S8,</b> center, has a 6.2-inch screen, but is about the same size as the 5.7-inch HTC U Ultra (left) and the 5.5-inch iPhone 7 Plus (right).</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>Galaxy S8+</b></h3><h4><b>AT A GLANCE</b></h4><p>With a gorgeous 6.2-inch display and a design that needs to be seen, the Galaxy S8+ truly changes the smartphone conversation.</p>\n<h4><b>PROS</b></h4><p>• Amazing, brilliant, eye-popping display.</p>\n<p>• An incredible design that makes a 6.2-inch screen feel like a 5.7-inch one.</p>\n<p>• Camera offers nice refinements over the S7, especially for selfies.</p>\n<h4><b>CONS</b></h4><p>• Fingerprint sensor is in a horrible location.</p>\n<p>• Bixby isn’t very useful or compelling.</p>\n<p>$850</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0095-0210/174664-1-eng-GB/f0095-022.jpg\" width=\"96\" height=\"18\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0095-02\" title=\"f0095-02\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div>\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0096-0161/174657-1-eng-GB/f0096-012.jpg\" width=\"873\" height=\"450\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0096-01\" title=\"f0096-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>No matter which</b> color you pick, you’ll be getting a black front plate with the S8+.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>Impossible dream</b></h3><p>If I didn’t know better I would have though Samsung sent me the wrong phone. The S8+ doesn’t look or feel anywhere near as big as it is, with a screen that makes other phablets seem small by comparison, despite a much smaller frame.</p>\n<p>Even after using it for several days, it’s still hard to believe that the S8+ has 6.2-inch display. At 159.5mm tall, it practically defies logic. Consider this: it’s smaller than the HTC U Ultra, and only a few millimeters taller than Galaxy S7 Edge, Pixel XL, and LG G6 but somehow adds a full half-inch of screen (and in the case of the Pixel and S7, nearly three-quarters of an inch). It’s like holding an optical illusion.</p>\n<p>And the Infinity Display, as Samsung is calling it, is an absolute pleasure to behold. The curved edges rest gracefully in your hand, and whether you’re using one hand or both, its natural contours and glass-and-metal craftsmanship give it a smooth feel without it being too cumbersome or slippery. Which is good, because it’s practically a crime to put it in a case.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0097-0142/174650-1-eng-GB/f0097-012.jpg\" width=\"731\" height=\"269\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0097-01\" title=\"f0097-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>Everything about the</b> Galaxy S8+ is perfectly symmetrical except for the USB-C port, which is just slightly off-center.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>Slim is in</b></h3><p>Unlike some other slim-bezel smartphones, the Galaxy S8+ is blissfully symmetrical, with perfectly proportioned slivers of bezel above and below the screen. But where the S7 was available in white, silver, and gold, the S8+ only comes with black front plate, a move meant to seemingly put even greater emphasis on the screen. Every phone I’ve ever owned has had a black frame, so I’m on board with the decision, but some are sure to grumble over the silver and grey-backed versions having black bezels on the front. I think such a small area of color at the top and bottom of the screen would have been distracting.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0097-0211/174643-1-eng-GB/f0097-022.jpg\" width=\"873\" height=\"447\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0097-02\" title=\"f0097-02\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>The AKG earbuds</b> that ship with the Galaxy S8+ are hands-down the best bundled earphones I’ve ever used.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>The only quibble I have with the design is the same one I have with other Galaxy phones: the placement of the charging port. Where the speaker and the headphone jack are centered on the bottom edge of the device, the new USB-C port is a just a touch too low, otherwise ruining the perfect equilibrium. For a phone that pays such fastidious attention to its design, it’s a head-scratcher.</p>\n<p>Samsung has sculpted a real work of art with the Galaxy S8+. Features that would grab headlines on either phones, like IP68 water resistance and wireless charging, are practically an afterthought, and its competitors, including Apple, are going to have their work cut out for them. And the fact that Samsung was able to do all his without removing the 3.5mm headphone jack makes Apple’s “courageous” decision seem all the more outlandish.</p>\n<p>As if to drive that point home, Samsung has bundled a pair of AKG wired earbuds, which are far and away the best sounding earphones I’ve gotten inside the box. I’m no audiophile, but the bass, balance, and volume of these things are top-notch, rivaling the sound I get from my PowerBeats3.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0098-0141/174636-1-eng-GB/f0098-012.jpg\" width=\"873\" height=\"475\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0098-01\" title=\"f0098-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>Even next to</b> another slim-bexeled phone like the LG G6 (left), the Galaxy S8+ is unmistakable.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>Fingerprint fumble</b></h3><p>With an 83 percent screen-to-body ratio, Samsung didn’t leave much room on the Galaxy S8+ for much of anything else. Aside from the sensors, the front of the device has no distinguishable markings, and that includes the Samsung logo. However, even without its name emblazoned below the display, the S8+ is unmistakable, easily as identifiable as an iPhone 7.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0099-0144/174629-1-eng-GB/f0099-012.jpg\" width=\"591\" height=\"394\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0099-01\" title=\"f0099-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>You practically need</b> to be a finger acrobat to hit the fingerprint scanner on the first try.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>For the first time, Samsung is also doing away with the physical home button and back/recents buttons; hardly an innovation in Android land but new territory for Galaxy phones. And it kind of shows. While the pressure-sensitive virtual on-screen home button is a winner, the fingerprint button is in the worst possible place. Surely you’ve seen images of its location to the right of the camera, but it’s even more awkward than the pictures would have you believe.</p>\n<p>It took me longer to set up a single fingerprint than it does for multiple ones on other phones. A left-handed colleague actually had a slightly easier time, but I consistently missed the target when trying to use it. At times when I needed to use the fingerprint sensor for apps like Mint or 1Password, it took me several tries, sometimes to the point where it would have been quicker just to type in my password. (However, on the off chance that I hit it on the first try, it worked extremely quickly.)</p>\n<p>Thankfully (or perhaps consequently), Samsung has provided multiple ways to unlock the S8+. In addition to the standard passcode and password options, there’s face and iris unlocking, both of which are quick but require you to stare at the front-facing cameras above the screen. The iris scanner is particularly impressive as well as being far more secure. It worked flawlessly nearly every time, even when I was wearing glasses. The only time I had difficulty was in direct sunlight, when the infrared sensor struggled to lock onto my irises until I took my glasses off.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0100-0147/174622-1-eng-GB/f0100-012.jpg\" width=\"385\" height=\"313\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0100-01\" title=\"f0100-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>The Galaxy S8+</b> has an iris scanner that works remarkable well.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div>\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0100-028/174615-1-eng-GB/f0100-022.jpg\" width=\"591\" height=\"348\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0100-02\" title=\"f0100-02\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>The Edge screen</b> is a joy to use on the Galaxy S8+.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>I quickly learned how to position my phone so my eyes would unlock it as quickly as possible, but I had a harder time adjusting to the face scanner. All in all, I would still prefer using my fingerprint. I also would have liked the ability to tap an area other than the virtual home button to wake the screen, but even so, the new unlocking methods are a nice upgrade for the S8+. Just keep in mind that face recognition could be spoofed by a picture, as Samsung warns, so iris scanning is your best bet here, unless you happen to have fingers like Elastigirl.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0101-0139/174608-1-eng-GB/f0101-012.jpg\" width=\"873\" height=\"504\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0101-01\" title=\"f0101-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>With an edge-to-edge</b> screen, the S8+ is like having a tiny cinema in your pocket.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>Pure pixels</b></h3><p>As good as the design is when the screen is off, it’s only accentuated when it comes to life. Even if you’ve previously used an Edge phone, the S8+ still feels like something entirely new, with edges that seamlessly blend into the frame and corners that dip elegantly out of view. It’s hard to do it justice with words, but I’ll say this: It makes all other phones, including the similarly svelte LG G6, look positively dull.</p>\n<p>By making it a standard feature, Samsung has essentially taken the Edge screen out of beta mode, and it’s absolutely ready for its closeup. Even when purposefully holding one of the sides, it didn’t register a single extraneous touch, and the Edge-specific features only launched when deliberately activated. The panels offer the same customizable access to your favorite apps and contacts, and there are several new ones installed by default (I particularly liked the clipboard one to keep track of all of the screenshots I took). Edge Feeds are nowhere to be found in the Settings or the Galaxy Apps store, so it appears that Samsung has thought better of the ticker’s usefulness. However, the notification lights remain.</p>\n<p>Samsung has stuck with a 2K screen for the S8+. However, while it has a slightly higher pixel count (2960 vs 2560) due to its new 18.5 by 9 aspect ratio, it’s hard to imagine a 4K display adding anything more than a tax on the battery. Even when using the default FHD+ resolution (2220 x 1080) the screen is crisp, bright, and stunningly vibrant, especially when watching movies in full screen. And since the S8+ offers the first display to carry the new Mobile HDR Premium certification, once Netflix and Amazon ramp up their mobile apps, it will easily be the best handheld movie player you can buy.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0102-0141/174601-1-eng-GB/f0102-012.jpg\" width=\"591\" height=\"364\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0102-01\" title=\"f0102-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>The new Snapdragon</b> 835 is faster than the 821, but not so much so that you’ll notice a huge difference in everyday tasks.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>Consolidation of power</b></h3><p>The Galaxy S8+ may be pretty on the outside, but on the inside it’s all business. It’s the first phone to be powered by the 10nm Snapdragon 835, and the gains it delivers over the S7 are certainly palpable.</p>\n<p>But that’s measuring it against a year-old chip, so noticeable gains are to be expected. The upgrade is less obvious when comparing it to the newer 821 phones like the Pixel and LG G6. To the untrained and unbenchmarked eye, the S8+ could just as easily have an 821 chip inside it, as the real-world differences between the two are fairly inconsiderable. The S8+ feels just as snappy and smooth as other 821 phones, and I didn’t experience any of the dreaded and oft-reported Samsung lag. Benchmarks bear this out, with a measurable but not massive increase over Qualcomm’s predecessor.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0103-0137/174594-1-eng-GB/f0103-012.jpg\" width=\"591\" height=\"377\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0103-01\" title=\"f0103-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>If there’s one</b> area where the new Snapdragon 835 takes a big step up, it’s 3D graphics performance.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>That being said, the 835 is the first chip I’ve tested that’s in the same league as Huawei’s in-house Kirin 960, and it even held its own against Apple’s latest silicon.

Until Samsung can refine the performance of its Exynos chips for U.S. networks, this is the next best thing.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0103-0210/174587-1-eng-GB/f0103-022.jpg\" width=\"591\" height=\"377\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0103-02\" title=\"f0103-02\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>Battery life belies</b> the phone’s rather pedestrian battery capacity.

After the Note7 debacle, Samsung has promised to put every phone it sells through a strenuous 8-point battery check, but that doesn’t mean it crammed a giant battery into the S8+. There’s actually a smaller 3,500 mAh battery here (compared to the 3,600 mAh one in the S7 Edge), but Samsung has taken advantage of the 835’s power efficiency improvements, along with likely improved efficiency of its AMOLED displays, to squeeze out as much battery life as possible. Benchmark testing consistently showed around 9 hours, and my day-to-day experience matched up, easily getting through a full day of moderate-to-heavy use. The Galaxy S8+ was still ticking hours after the G6 and the Pixel would have needed a charge.</p>\n<p>Our battery benchmarks calibrate the display to 200 nits with adaptive brightness turned off but cellular and Wi-Fi turned on, and the phone turned in some impressive scores.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0104-0149/174580-1-eng-GB/f0104-012.jpg\" width=\"591\" height=\"395\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0104-01\" title=\"f0104-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>The Galaxy S8+</b> warns against using certain settings that could have an impact on battery life.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>Along with the benefits begotten by the 835 chip, Samsung has also souped up its OS to get every last drop from the battery. For one, the default resolution is “only” 2220 x 1080 FHD+, and Samsung actually warns about the possible increased battery drain when raising it to WQXD+. Android enthusiasts will scoff at this, but the visible difference between the two resolutions is negligible outside of higher-end gaming and VR. Even when I switched WQHD+ on for a full day, I didn’t notice the kind of enormous battery hit that would preclude you from using it.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0105-0141/174573-1-eng-GB/f0105-012.jpg\" width=\"591\" height=\"397\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0105-01\" title=\"f0105-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>The parts of</b> Bixby that work, namely Home and Vision, aren’t all that compelling.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>Samsung has also tweaked the brightness slider to add a “red zone” to indicate the very high levels that seriously impact battery life. Again, hard-core users will grouse about such a warning, but I’d much rather Samsung give us the option than simply cripple the display.

Both will let you customize how your phone will save battery, offering toggles for brightness, resolution, and chip speed. It’s a definite improvement over Google’s all-or-nothing method, and with the right tweaks you can add several hours without degrading the experience too much. Battery warriors will be bummed to see the multi-day Ultra setting ditched in favor of a less-intense Max mode, but you’ll at least be able to triple your battery life in exchange for some serious limitations on the apps you can use.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0106-0145/174566-1-eng-GB/f0106-012.jpg\" width=\"585\" height=\"311\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0106-01\" title=\"f0106-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>The new Bixby</b> button is just below the volume rocker, but it doesn’t work as it should just yet.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>Big bad Bixby</b></h3><p>Along the right edge of the device you’ll find a sole power button as always, but there’s a new arrangement on the left. Samsung has thankfully gone with a volume rocker instead of individual keys, and below it there’s a new button dedicated to its inchoate AI assistant, which it calls Bixby. It’s one of the premier features of the S8 and the start of a new voice-powered ecosystem for Samsung, but unfortunately it’s not quite ready for prime time yet.</p>\n<p>I mean that both literally and anecdotally. Just days before the S8’s launch, Samsung announced that Bixby Voice, the primary method for communicating with Bixby, wouldn’t be able to understand English speakers until it is patched later this spring. As such, there’s no way to actually summon Bixby on the S8+, and the parts that do work are more like random app features than a cohesive system.</p>\n<p>Pressing the Bixby button brings up the Hello Bixby home screen, a Google Now-like set of cards that show your schedule, reminders, weather, activity, steps, etc. There’s nothing bad about it, but it doesn’t bring anything new to the table. Most manufacturers have already created their own spin on the personalized recommendation system, and while Samsung’s version looks nice enough, I just don’t see a compelling reason to use it.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0107-0138/174559-1-eng-GB/f0107-012.jpg\" width=\"873\" height=\"564\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0107-01\" title=\"f0107-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>Bixby Vision will</b> generally recognize what it’s looking at, but it doesn’t always understand specifics.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>Seeing isn’t believing</b></h3><p>The other functioning part of Bixby, other than a pretty standard implementation of location-based reminders, is Vision, Samsung’s take on Google’s long-forgotten Goggles project. Its real-world discovery concept is unique to a digital assistant, but it’s not the first time someone has tapped into the camera to identify things on a phone. And the last effort didn’t go so well.</p>\n<p>You may remember a few years back when Amazon took a stab at making a smartphone. Called the Fire Phone, its premier feature was called Firefly, and while it was primarily a way to wrangle shoppers, the concept was very similar to what Bixby is doing here. But even with the power of <a href=\"http://Amazon.com\" target=\"_self\">Amazon.com</a> behind it, Firefly quickly fizzled out, and I’m not sure Bixby Vision will fare much better. It works well enough, but I just don’t see the usefulness of it beyond the occasional query.</p>\n<p>Presumably you’ll be able to activate it by speaking once Bixby Voice goes live, but for now you need to open the camera app first, or choose a picture from the Gallery app. You’ll see a new eye icon at the left of the screen, and tapping it will turn your camera into Bixby’s virtual eyes, ready to scan whatever it sees. Once it locks on an image it will offer up a options to search for similar Pinterest images or Amazon shopping results, and, if applicable, text translations and wine identification. I wasn’t wowed by any of the results. While it did recognize the things I scanned as what they were, it didn’t always get the the specifics right. Books were mostly on the money (aside from some older obscure titles), but common objects were more hit-or-miss. For example, it knew that my MacBook was a laptop, but offered just as many PC notebooks in the results as Macs.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, Bixby isn’t something I’m going to use very often. That might change once voice commands are activated, but for now, Google Assistant fits my needs, and Bixby doesn’t do nearly enough for me to consider switching. But even though Samsung is promoting Bixby as a major feature of the S8, it’s hardly an essential one, and before long you’ll likely forget it’s even there. Nothing about what I saw led me to believe that voice will add anything ground-breaking to the Bixby experience, but I’m willing to hold out judgement for now.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0108-0144/174552-1-eng-GB/f0108-012.jpg\" width=\"873\" height=\"517\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0108-01\" title=\"f0108-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>Bixby does a</b> pretty good job with books, but it’s just as easy to use the Amazon app.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>Bixby is a massive undertaking for the company with an equally ambitious roadmap, and it will likely take years of refinements before it can stand with the likes of Siri and Google Assistant.

Until the Pixel came around last year its only true competitor was the iPhone, and even there it was kind of a toss-up as to which was better. Like Apple, most of Samsung’s magic goes on behind the scenes, which might explain why the main camera is visually unchanged from the S7, save for a new sensor (with the same resolution and dual-pixel focus technology) and the elimination of the 0.46mm camera bump, making it fully flush against the case.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0109-028/174538-1-eng-GB/f0109-022.jpg\" width=\"591\" height=\"394\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0109-02\" title=\"f0109-02\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>Both the iPhone</b> 7 Plus (left) and the Galaxy S8+ performed extremely well in bright sunlight, but I found the S8+ to have a touch more clarity and definition.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div>\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0110-0139/174531-1-eng-GB/f0110-012.jpg\" width=\"591\" height=\"394\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0110-01\" title=\"f0110-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>With HDR turned</b> on, the Galaxy S7 (left) blew out the shadows in bright sunlight.

Rapidly becoming a standard smartphone feature, the dual-camera system is responsible for the LG G6’s wide-angle prowess and the iPhone 7 Plus’s portrait mode, and it was widely assumed that the S8+ would simply follow suit to keep pace. However, while Samsung experimented with a second camera, it ultimately decided that it didn’t need it. It’s a bold decision for a premium phone in 2017, but the S8+ isn’t about following trends, it’s about setting them. And Samsung has done more with the a single camera than most other manufacturers have done with two.</p>\n<p>Samsung is so confident in its processing prowess, it hasn’t even done much to upgrade the camera hardware it does have in the S8+. You’ll find the same 12MP Dual Pixel, f/1.7 lens, and optical image stabilization, but the sensor’s been upgraded. Depending on region, you’ll either get a Sony IMX333 or a Samsung-made Isocell S5K3H1, as compared to the IMX260 or S5K2L1 in the Galaxy S7. Samsung has made most of its improvements behind the scenes, with updated image processing algorithms.</p>\n<p>It might not seem like much, it makes a noticeable difference in your final shot. In tests between the Galaxy S7 and S8+, photos were consistently truer to life with the newer sensor, with the S7’s pics seeming washed out in bright sunlight and oversaturated in lower light.</p>\n<p>The differences were only accentuated with HDR turned on, with the S8+ picking up greater detail and better contrast when dealing with strong shadows and midtones (almost to a fault), and the S7’s overcompensation distorting colors and blowing out the contrast.</p>\n<h3><b>Super selfies</b></h3><p>The camera app is mostly the same, with a nice set of pro controls and a series of shooting modes, including the sublime selective focus. The only new additions to speak of come in the form of Snapchat-style stickers and filters that add a bit of whimsy to your shots. They work with both the front and rear cameras, but they obviously seem more designed for selfies, an area where Samsung has paid pretty close attention.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0111-0138/174524-1-eng-GB/f0111-012.jpg\" width=\"591\" height=\"266\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0111-01\" title=\"f0111-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>While the Galaxy</b> S7 photo on the left is more vibrant, the iPhone 7 Plus (center) is more true to life.

It’s so fun, I’m kind of surprised Snapchat didn’t think of it first and release it as its own standalone camera app. The S8+’s rear camera might be the go-to shooter for capturing scenic shots, but people who have never taken a selfie before are going to find themselves using the front camera more and more.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0112-028/174510-1-eng-GB/f0112-022.jpg\" width=\"334\" height=\"299\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0112-02\" title=\"f0112-02\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>The Galaxy S8+’s</b> interface is much cleaner than the Galaxy S7’s.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>Clearer skin</b></h3><p>And then we have TouchWiz or, as it’s now called, Samsung Experience.</p>\n<p>Obviously it runs on Android Nougat, but it’s only 7.0 for now, still several updates behind schedule.

It will still have its share of detractors simply due to its deviation from stock Android, but it’s a massive improvement over the Marshmallow version. It take a lot of cues from the Galaxy S7’s Nougat build, but it all looks and feels like it was hand-made for the S8+. All of the unremovable Samsung apps and services are well represented of course (more than 15 in all, including a couple new ones), but they’ve all been redesigned for Nougat and some of them, such as the Calendar and Clock, aren’t half-bad. And I love how the broken-line icon motif matches the virtual home and navigation button.</p>\n<p>The new weather widget is the home screen’s most striking feature, and while I liked it, it’s definitely an acquired taste. Its minimal, vertical design certainly fits the S8’s tall screen well, but like the rest of the Samsung Experience, it’s not quite as classy as the one on the Pixel</p>\n<p>Launcher. But what the new interface lacks in elegance it makes up for with its highly personal and intuitive interface. Along with the usual Touchwiz customizations to tweak the font style, LED indicator, always-on display, and that awesome shrunken-screen gesture for one-handed operation, there are handy little touches all over that make the interface much less aggravating than on previous Galaxy releases.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0114-0141/174496-1-eng-GB/f0114-012.jpg\" width=\"381\" height=\"356\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0114-01\" title=\"f0114-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>Even the always-on</b> display has gotten a update for Nougat.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>I particularly appreciated the small, mindful additions, such as the 3D touch-like icon menus, and switches to turn off all notifications and condense the status bar to the just the last three icons. But what most stood out about the interface is its smart and careful attention to detail. While I would probably still choose stock Android if a Google Play edition model ever made a comeback, there’s a sense here that Samsung is finally building its interface to take specific advantage of the hardware. It’s not unlike the way Google has optimized its own custom launcher for the Pixel, and it’ll be interesting to see if Samsung starts taking updates more seriously as a result.</p>\n<h3><b>Down to earth</b></h3><p>The S8+ is every bit as stunning as the iPhone 7 Plus, and when put side by side, it shows how stale Apple’s design has become. And while it may be a millimeter thicker than the iPhone 7, its tapered edges make it feel every bit as svelte, and it has a headphone jack to boot. The iPhone 8 may very well put the pressure back on Samsung to up its game with the Galaxy S9, but for now, the best designed phone isn’t made in Cupertino.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0115-0142/174489-1-eng-GB/f0115-012.jpg\" width=\"873\" height=\"588\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0115-01\" title=\"f0115-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>The design of</b> the Galaxy S8+ can be summed up in one word: stunning.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div>\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0115-027/174482-1-eng-GB/f0115-022.jpg\" width=\"358\" height=\"285\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0115-02\" title=\"f0115-02\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>If you preorder</b> the S8+, you’ll get a free Gear VR, which looks amazing with the S8+.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>And while it certainly exists in the same stratosphere as other premium phones, its price, $850 for 64GB of storage, is actually more of a value than previous Galaxy S phones.

The S8+’s marvelous screen makes VR look better than ever while the new controller brings the easy navigation that was missing from the first model.</p>\n<p>And the Oculus library is already way more extensive than the Daydream’s, with a slew of controller-ready titles on the way.</p>\n<h3><b>Should you buy it?</b></h3><p>If you’ve gotten this far you already know the answer to this question. But I’ll say it anyway: If you want the very best Android has to offer, go get a Galaxy S8+. It’s not perfect, but it’s as close as you can get. And it’s hard to imagine another phone coming close anytime soon, except maybe the iPhone 8.</p>\n<p>Bixby may be dead (or at least seriously injured) on arrival, but Samsung will surely continue to refine and perfect its AI system with regular updates, so it’s something that will likely get better over time. But Bixby is at best an added benefit and is in no way essential to the S8+ experience, so even if it never evolves into something you want to use, the value of the phone won’t be lessened as a result.</p>\n<p>There are a lot of firsts for the S8+, but unlike prior Galaxy S models, it’s not just about getting there before Apple or Google. Bixby aside, the S8+ has a propitious relationship between hardware and software, and as such, it represents a massive leap over prior Galaxy efforts and finally feels like a complete end-to-end package.</p>\n<p>If it wasn’t for the downright hostile placement of the fingerprint sensor that frustrated me every single time I used it, the S8+ would be the first phone I’ve used worth of 5 stars, and that includes the iPhone 7 Plus. Your move, Apple.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n

convention centers, and the streets of wherever the heck you’re doing business. Even a thin laptop can become a 2.5-pound problem, but now it’s a problem that could very well be solved by the DeX (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/ssdex\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/ssdex</a>), Samsung’s desktop-PC-in-a-dock for the Galaxy S8 and S8+ smartphones.</p>\n<p>Drop your Galaxy phone into the DeX dock ($150 at Amazon, go. <a href=\"http://pcworld.com/dexdkamz\" target=\"_self\">pcworld.com/dexdkamz</a>, or the Samsung store, <a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com</a>/ dexdkss), then connect the DeX to a desktop monitor or TV over HDMI. Boom: You now have a 1920x1080 PC desktop with resizable windows. Except all your programs are mobile apps. And, yeah, your desktop is Android, not Windows. But it works!</p>\n<p>I’ve already shared my first impressions (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/dex1st\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/dex1st</a>) of the DeX, so check out that article for extra details on the DeX experience (none of my early opinions have changed). Now I’m ready to give my final review, all based on using the Galaxy S8+ and the DeX as my only PC at work for seven days. Could I still do everything my workflow requires, from Slacking with co-workers to editing photos to building articles like this in our company’s custom content management system (CMS)?</p>\n<p>In three words: yes, yes, and yes. And more.</p>\n<h3><b>Samsung DeX</b></h3><h4><b>AT A GLANCE</b></h4><p>Offering a 1920x1080 desktop with resizable windows, Samsung’s dock for the S8 and S8+ is a surprisingly capable PC replacement.</p>\n<h4><b>PROS</b></h4><p>• Resizable windows—it feels like a Windows desktop!</p>\n<p>• Existing DeX support for Microsoft office, Adobe apps, and other critical must-haves</p>\n<p>• Surprisingly zippy performance on the S8 processor</p>\n<h4><b>CONS</b></h4><p>• Bluetooth pairing needs an overhaul</p>\n<p>• One monitor (out of five) failed to run DeX properly</p>\n<p>$150</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0118-0146/174763-1-eng-GB/f0118-012.jpg\" width=\"96\" height=\"18\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0118-01\" title=\"f0118-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>Once you get past the DeX pain points...</b></h3><p>As I shared before, the biggest pain point with DeX is Bluetooth pairing. If you intend to use a Bluetooth keyboard and mouse with the DeX (which would make perfect sense in traveling scenarios), you’ll need to pair the accessories before you insert your Galaxy phone in the cradle. Once you dock the phone, its screen goes dark, making it impossible to pair Bluetooth devices from the handset. Meanwhile, the DeX startup screen on the desktop will require a passcode—which you can’t enter unless you have a keyboard already paired.</p>\n<p>The upshot: I opted for a USB keyboard and mouse throughout my testing. The DeX dock has two USB 2.0 ports, one ethernet port, and a USB-C port for power (and, yes, the DeX Station will charge your docked phone).</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0119-0137/174756-1-eng-GB/f0119-012.jpg\" width=\"873\" height=\"588\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0119-01\" title=\"f0119-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>With a simple</b> mouse drag, you can resize windows on the DeX desktop.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>Once connected to a display, DeX casts a 1920x1080 desktop that looks remarkably like a PC. Shortcuts to your favorite apps appear vertically on the left, and open apps dock on the bottom. Mouse over the docked apps, and you’ll get previews of the activity at hand. But, hey, you’re still in Android, so the lower right of the desktop showcases your full Android notifications tray.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0119-028/174749-1-eng-GB/f0119-022.jpg\" width=\"304\" height=\"236\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0119-02\" title=\"f0119-02\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>Luckily, the DeX</b> includes two USB ports—so you don’t need to rely on Bluetooth pairing for your keyboard and mouse.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>The 1080p resolution doesn’t offer a ton of screen real estate and it does suffer a bit of blurry pixel interpolation. But it’s still very laptop-like, and because DeX accommodates resizable windows in a good number of Android apps, I found multitasking to be both familiar and easy. The display’s refresh rate is a bit laggy, but my bigger concern is universal support: I tested the DeX on four common 1900x1200 desktop monitors, and one 4K TV, and one of the four monitors refused to run DeX fullscreen. Instead, the display was horribly letterboxed, top and bottom, left and right.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0120-0140/174742-1-eng-GB/f0120-012.jpg\" width=\"873\" height=\"492\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0120-01\" title=\"f0120-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>This is how</b> DeX looks when it’s running properly. Chrome, Settings, and Play all offer resizable windows in DeX, but Reddit Is Fun is locked to its mobile app proportions. Note how notifications appear in the lower right-hand corner.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>Let this serve as a reminder that when you’re traveling with the DeX for business, you’re at the mercy of whatever monitor or TV you may find in your hotel room or business lounge. I would also suggest bringing along an HDMI-to-DVI adapter, just in case. But, hey, in terms of getting full resolution, a four out of five hit rate isn’t bad.</p>\n<h3><b>Windows—but in an Android playground</b></h3><p>Once properly set up at work, I spent all my time with an S8+ review unit docked in the DeX Station. My work requirements aren’t particularly exotic. I don’t need to get into CAD or download torrents. But I do need to build articles in my company’s custom CMS; edit documents in Word and Google Docs; and download and edit images, and then load them into the CMS. And, yeah, I also need to Slack coworkers, check email, and glance at the NBA playoff schedule and check what’s happening in my favorite Subreddits.</p>\n<p>Let’s now look at all of those activities in reverse order.</p>\n<p>My Reddit reader of choice is the Reddit Is Fun app (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/rditfun\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/rditfun</a>). Unfortunately, along with a few other Android apps I regularly use, it doesn’t offer a resizable window in DeX. Samsung currently lists 30 apps (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/ssdexapps\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/ssdexapps</a>) with DeX support, but I’m not sure how support is even defined. If it simply means the app provides a resizable window in DeX, then Samsung’s list is incomplete. To wit: Slack doesn’t make the list, but does have a resizable window.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0121-0137/174735-1-eng-GB/f0121-012.jpg\" width=\"873\" height=\"555\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0121-01\" title=\"f0121-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>The dock itself</b> is small and light. And of course it charges your S8.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>At any rate, I eventually opted to read Reddit in Chrome, as Chrome has DeX support. I also used Chrome to read my Outlook Mail because my Android lockbox for Outlook—an app called Nine—doesn’t have a resizable window either.</p>\n<p>As for the Slack app, it frequently reminded me I was still in an Android environment: Because it’s a <i>mobile</i> app, it will show your status as offline unless its window is active in the foreground of the DeX desktop. This behavior makes sense when the app is running on a smartphone, because the phone could be in your pocket, where a dormant app really does mean you’re offline. Nonetheless, on DeX, this Android behavior made me miss quite a few direct messages, especially because I never received Slack notifications either.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0122-0137/174728-1-eng-GB/f0122-012.jpg\" width=\"591\" height=\"377\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0122-01\" title=\"f0122-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>Hover over a</b> docked icon, and you’ll see a little preview—just like in Windows.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>DeX gets productive</b></h3><p>While Slack proved problematic, my other main messaging platform—regular old SMS—was better than ever. Because your DeX’ed S8 is both your phone and your PC, you can have full texting conversations on your desktop in the resizable Messages app. Likewise, you can make voice calls from your docked S8. Just launch the phone dialer and make the call, and you’ll hear your partner over the docked speakerphone.</p>\n<p>Music apps? I experienced mixed behaviors. Spotify launched in a fixed Android portrait window, and refused to play music. But YouTube and Google Play Music cooperated, playing music through the phone’s speakers.</p>\n<p>But enough about these distractions. Let’s talk productivity. DeX supports a number of image editing apps, but I opted to go with Adobe Photoshop Lightroom (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/lrm\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/lrm</a>), which is both incredibly refined for a mobile app, and runs speedy-fine on the Snapdragon 835 processor of the Galaxy S8+. What’s more, it wasn’t much of a hassle to find the images I needed to edit. Once you download a file, it appears in My Files, the rudimentary Android file manager app that’s preloaded at the top of the DeX desktop.</p>\n<p>Editing raw text was just as easy. When my staffers sent me video scripts via email, I simply clicked on the links to Google Drive, and up popped the scripts in Google Docs (which also supports resizable windows, cut and paste, and other DeX behaviors). Mind you, I was still in the mobile version of Docs, so some tasks—like simply adding a comment—required a few extra inputs. But it never felt excessively tedious.</p>\n<p>DeX also supports the mobile Microsoft Office suite, including Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote, OneDrive and Skype. You’ll need an Office365 subscription to unlock everything, but once you’re up and running, you’ll feel right at home.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0123-0139/174721-1-eng-GB/f0123-012.jpg\" width=\"591\" height=\"379\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0123-01\" title=\"f0123-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>The Android version</b> of Lightroom ran without hiccups on the Snapdragon 835 built into the Galaxy S8+.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div>\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0124-0135/174714-1-eng-GB/f0124-012.jpg\" width=\"873\" height=\"576\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0124-01\" title=\"f0124-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>But could I CMS?</b></h3><p>The real productivity test would be working inside our custom content management system. This workflow requires getting through password protection; uploading images; searching through a database for images; and making finicky text edits in what can often be a slow and inflexible cloud-based environment.</p>\n<p>To race right to the payoff: Working in the CMS was easy. I never hit a brick wall, and performance was more than acceptable.</p>\n<p>I entered the CMS via Chrome, and had zero issues with password management (the days when mobile browsers forgot our passwords are clearly over). Uploading images required a bit of creativity: At the beginning of my week of testing, when I clicked Upload New Image in the CMS interface, Chrome presented me with four source options: Camera, Camcorder, My Files (the Android file manager), and Documents (Google Drive). From there I could easily navigate to My Files, where my downloaded images were stored.</p>\n<p>Strangely, toward the end of the week, the CMS interface stopped giving me My Files as a directory option. But I easily found a workaround by jumping into Google Drive and uploading images stored in the phone’s My Files directory.</p>\n<p>And that was pretty much the only hiccup. Otherwise, all my CMS activity was business as usual (if perhaps a bit slow).</p>\n<h3><b>The bottom line</b></h3><p>Would I like to have multi-monitor support? Absolutely. Am I irritated by Bluetooth pairing challenges? Sure. But it’s pretty hard to poke holes in DeX when I can get all my day-to-day work done with relatively little hassle.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, there’s still the uncertainty of what displays will be waiting for you in the vast business-travel unknown. How many hotel rooms will have TVs with HDMI ports? How many hotels can loan you a desktop display? And what happens if you get seemingly appropriate hardware, but DeX still letterboxes its desktop?</p>\n<p>These are questions that give me pause when thinking about leaving my laptop at home. But, wow, when DeX is up and running, it really delivers. This is a platform that Samsung should migrate to other Galaxy phones; that Google should steal for Pixel 2; and that Microsoft should study for its Continuum scheme. There’s a lot to like about the Galaxy S8 and S8+, but for people who work, DeX might be the best feature of all.</p>\n","layout":{},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":1,"link_source":"","competition":[],"flatplan_title":"","notes":"","gutter_credit":"","other":"","image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1496850608.4563","name":"f0117-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0117-0139/174777-1-eng-GB/f0117-012.jpg?t=default_ipad_portrait&ext/f0117-012_default_ipad_portrait.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"768","height":"432","legacy_id":"18386","is_default":true},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1496850608.4563","name":"f0117-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0117-0139/174777-1-eng-GB/f0117-012.jpg?t=default_ipad_landscape&ext/f0117-012_default_ipad_landscape.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"1024","height":"576","legacy_id":"18386","is_default":false}],"related_objects":{"image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_9_1496850599.4067","name":"f0124-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0124-0135/174714-1-eng-GB/f0124-012.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"873","height":"576","legacy_id":"18377"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_9_1496850599.4067","name":"f0124-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0124-0135/174714-1-eng-GB/f0124-012.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"873","height":"576","legacy_id":"18377"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_8_1496850600.3925","name":"f0123-01","source":"","caption":"<p><b>The Android version</b> of Lightroom ran without hiccups on the Snapdragon 835 built into the Galaxy S8+.</p>\n","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0123-0139/174721-1-eng-GB/f0123-012.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"591","height":"379","legacy_id":"18378"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_8_1496850600.3925","name":"f0123-01","source":"","caption":"<p><b>The Android version</b> of Lightroom ran without hiccups on the Snapdragon 835 built into the Galaxy S8+.</p>\n","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0123-0139/174721-1-eng-GB/f0123-012.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"591","height":"379","legacy_id":"18378"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_7_1496850601.2604","name":"f0122-01","source":"","caption":"<p><b>Hover over a</b> docked icon, and you’ll see a little preview—just like in Windows.</p>\n","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0122-0137/174728-1-eng-GB/f0122-012.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"591","height":"377","legacy_id":"18379"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_7_1496850601.2604","name":"f0122-01","source":"","caption":"<p><b>Hover over a</b> docked icon, and you’ll see a little preview—just like in Windows.</p>\n","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0122-0137/174728-1-eng-GB/f0122-012.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"591","height":"377","legacy_id":"18379"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_6_1496850602.2131","name":"f0121-01","source":"","caption":"<p><b>The dock itself</b> is small and light.

Many processors, RAM modules, and graphics cards can be overclocked, usually by adjusting their settings via your motherboard’s UEFI BIOS. Operate in safe margins and overclocking shouldn’t damage your PC. But, as we’ll discuss, it’s important to manage the additional heat that accelerated hardware can generate.</p>\n<h3><b>Some tips for the journey</b></h3><p>There are a few guiding principles worth considering before you overclock a CPU. First, not all processors can be easily overclocked. If you’re Team AMD, you’re probably in luck. Intel, however, locks most of its mainstream CPUs to prevent smart users from purchasing a budget component and jacking up its performance. Pricier enthusiast processor lines (identified by a K or X suffix, such as the Intel Core i5-7600K), on the other hand, are sold unlocked and can therefore be overclocked.</p>\n<p>Even then, bear in mind that processors are unique slabs of silicon and electronics. Some processors can tolerate higher operating speeds better than others—even those of the same model and specification. It’s known as the “silicon lottery” for a reason!</p>\n<p>Stable overclocks entail a delicate balance of speed and heat. The more you push your processor, the hotter it’s going to get. If your PC becomes a little <i>too</i> toasty, integrated fail-safe measures should shut off the power before those expensive components are damaged. To keep your overclocked PC stable, your job is to keep it cool.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0141-0137/174954-1-eng-GB/f0141-012.jpg\" width=\"594\" height=\"446\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0141-01\" title=\"f0141-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>Boot up the</b> PC, press F2 (or Delete) at startup to access the BIOS, and get started.

Consider upgrading to a better-performing air cooler (such as those from Noctua, <a href=\"http://noctua.at\" target=\"_self\">noctua.at</a>) or investigate all-in-one liquid coolers, which work much like a car’s radiator. I recently upgraded my gaming rig with the NZXT Kraken X62, which pumps coolant over the CPU via a sealed system, then extracts the heat via a large radiator and double-fan assembly, mounted in the top of the case.</p>\n<p>We’re about to get hands-on with a mother-board’s UEFI BIOS software, which allows fine-tuning of your hardware settings. However, some motherboard manufacturers offer convenient apps that attempt to safely overclock your CPU for you. If these manual steps seem a little tough, then check out the likes of Asus Dual Intelligent Processors 5 (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/asusdip5\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/asusdip5</a>), Gigabyte EasyTune (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/gigabytesu\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/gigabytesu</a>), or Intel’s Extreme Tuning Utility (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/xtudl\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/xtudl</a>). MSI motherboards even have a physical OC Genie button you can press to turbocharge your PC.</p>\n<h3><b>Overclocking basics</b></h3><p>For this guide, I’m using an Asus Maximus VIII Hero Alpha motherboard with an Intel Core i7-6700K processor. Obviously, these steps may need to be tweaked for your particular hardware, but the principles still apply.</p>\n<p>Before you get started, be sure to download and install the latest BIOS software for your motherboard from the manufacturer’s website. It’s an important step to ensure you have the latest configuration options and that your efforts aren’t frustrated by known issues.</p>\n<p>Let’s boot up the PC, press F2 (or Delete) at startup to access the BIOS, and get started.</p>\n<p>This processor runs at a base frequency of 4GHz (4,000MHz) and is also equipped with a Max Turbo feature that boosts speeds to 4.2GHz when required. When idle, the CPU temperature is a cool 25 degrees C, with a core voltage of 1.264V—the amount of power that’s being supplied to the CPU.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0142-0136/174947-1-eng-GB/f0142-012.jpg\" width=\"592\" height=\"371\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0142-01\" title=\"f0142-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>To overclock the</b> CPU, we can adjust the base clock frequency or the ratio/ multiplier to achieve a faster CPU frequency.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>Click F7 to switch to Advanced Mode, which is where we’ll be spending most of our time in this guide. On the right of the screen, there are two additional settings to mention: BCLK is the base clock frequency, currently set to 100MHz. Underneath that, you’ll see a Ratio setting (often known as the multiplier). Your processor speed is a simple calculation of the base clock speed multiplied by the ratio. In this example, 100MHz x 40 equal 4,000MHz (4GHz).</p>\n<p>To overclock the CPU, we can adjust the base clock frequency or the ratio/multiplier to achieve a faster CPU frequency. A ratio of 42x with the same 100MHz base clock speed would deliver a CPU frequency of 4,200MHz, or 4.2GHz.</p>\n<h3><b>Switching to manual control</b></h3><p>Modern motherboards can be equipped with a raft of automated settings designed to make overclocking easy.</p>\n<p>In the Asus Extreme Tweaker menu, we switch the Ai Overclock Tuner from Auto to Manual, which allows access to the base clock frequency setting.</p>\n<p>You can now type a value into the BCLK Frequency field.

The voltage applied to your CPU varies continually. Faster operating speeds require additional power for stability. Your motherboard handles this behind the scenes but, should you wish, you can set manual voltage levels to support your overclocking efforts.</p>\n<p>Scroll down to CPU Core/Cache Voltage and click the drop-down menu. You can see three alternative settings. Manual Mode sets a single, static voltage level. Whether your CPU is idle or running at full tilt, the same voltage will be applied. Thinking about power consumption, Manual Mode is quite inefficient, but gives you the most control.</p>\n<p>Offset Mode works by adding (or subtracting, if you wished to underclock) a set amount of power to the standard voltage that the processor would use. The voltage would still vary based on requirements, but the range would be boosted by whatever step you configured. So, if you created an offset of 0.1 V, for example, and the processor typically requires 1.25 V to deliver a certain speed, 1.35 V would actually be supplied.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0145-0133/174926-1-eng-GB/f0145-012.jpg\" width=\"560\" height=\"421\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0145-01\" title=\"f0145-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>With the CPU</b> Core Ratio set to anything other than Auto, the Core Ratio Limit settings become editable.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>In Adaptive Mode, your CPU would only receive a voltage boost when it enters turbo mode. It’s worth noting that, on some motherboards, you can also include an Offset value for Adaptive Mode, that also provides a voltage boost to the processor outside of turbo mode.</p>\n<p>If you’re taking your first steps in overclocking, allow your motherboard to handle voltage automatically—at least until you’ve built up some experience. If you experience instability, then experiment with Adaptive and Offset modes to support your CPU with a small voltage boost. Benchmarking PCs in manual voltage modes can place significant stress on the CPU, increasing their risk of failure.</p>\n<p>Be sure to also pay attention to any contextual help provided in your UEFI BIOS, or motherboard manual. In the Adaptive Mode screenshot, you can see guidelines at the bottom of the screen outlining minimum and maximum voltage settings, as well as the increment to use.</p>\n<h3><b>Benchmark, then boost</b></h3><p>Now that we’ve discussed the basic principles of overclocking, I’m sure you’re wondering what settings to try for your own PC! As every processor is unique, there are no standard overclock settings that are guaranteed to work on every PC. It’s time to experiment!</p>\n<p>Let’s recap on the goal. We want to attain the fastest processor speed on a PC that remains cool(ish) and stable. By stable, I mean that it POSTs (completes the Power On Self Test), it boots into an operating system, and then successfully completes a benchmark stress test.</p>\n<p>My advice here is simple. Benchmark, then boost. Then benchmark again, then boost. And so on. Benchmark your PC in a non-overclocked state, to understand your baseline voltage, temperatures, and clock speeds. Then, increase the base clock frequency and/or multiplier to target a small boost (say, 0.2GHz). Reboot the PC and run your benchmark again to see if it’s stable. If it is, repeat the boost and benchmark. If not, dial back the target settings a little (or boost voltage) and try again.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0146-0136/174919-1-eng-GB/f0146-012.jpg\" width=\"592\" height=\"443\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0146-01\" title=\"f0146-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>Select Per Core</b> and you can target each core individually.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>Overclocking can be a laborious process, but this safe, incremental approach helps you gain a good understanding of your processor’s capabilities.</p>\n<p>There are a variety of applications you can use to benchmark your CPU.

As we know the CPU can handle 4.2GHz (the default turbo mode speed), for my first overclocking attempt, I’ll adjust the Core Ratio Limit to 44, which targets a maximum speed of 4.4GHz. I haven’t manually adjusted the voltage at this point, but can do so if these settings are unstable.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0148-0128/174905-1-eng-GB/f0148-012.jpg\" width=\"591\" height=\"444\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0148-01\" title=\"f0148-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>In Adaptive Mode,</b> your CPU would only receive a voltage boost when it enters turbo mode.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>Reboot the PC and open CPU-Z once again to check core speeds and voltage. With the new settings in place, we can validate a core speed of 4.4GHz and voltage of 1.44 V.</p>\n<p>Repeat the benchmark test to see if the PC remains stable with the CPU under load. This time, I noticed CPU temperatures spiking at 71°C with noticeably more fan noise generated by the CPU cooler’s pump and fans. However, the PC remained stable.</p>\n<p>CPU temperatures in the low- to mid-70s are about as high as you want to go for safe overclocking. Experience sustained temperatures in the 80s, and you’ll certainly be taking some risks with your hardware. But, in the spirit of adventure, I pressed on, incrementing target speeds by just 0.1GHz with each run.</p>\n<h3><b>Faster Doesn’t Always Lead to Better Performance</b></h3><p>I achieved an overclock of 4.8GHz before my PC became unstable. At 4.9GHz, it simply locked up when booting into Windows. At this speed, the peak temperature of the hottest core under load hit 87°C, which is a little uncomfortable. I’d be tempted to dial back for safety, but the results show what’s possible—at least for this processor.</p>\n<p>One final tip: Faster processor speeds won’t always lead to better performance. The additional heat generated by overclocking can sometimes cause your processor to throttle down, reducing performance. Look at my benchmark results to see the proof:</p>\n<p>There was a steady improvement in the single-core benchmark score as I increased the maximum CPU speed. However, the multi-core benchmark score is more erratic, peaking at 4.5GHz and then decaying as target speed (and peak temperatures) increase. There’s a sweet spot to be found—the best balance of speed, heat, and performance. It’s another great reason to test CPU performance in small increments. Benchmark, then boost.</p>\n<p>Remember, your results may well be different than mine, courtesy of that silicon lottery. But armed with a grip on the basics, take your time to tweak your own CPU settings and find its sweet spot. A 10 or 15 percent speed boost is yours for the taking, at no additional cost.</p>\n","layout":{},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":1,"link_source":"","competition":[],"flatplan_title":"","notes":"","gutter_credit":"","other":"","image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1496850635.0398","name":"f0139-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0139-0134/174968-1-eng-GB/f0139-012.jpg?t=default_ipad_portrait&ext/f0139-012_default_ipad_portrait.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"768","height":"482","legacy_id":"18411","is_default":true},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1496850635.0398","name":"f0139-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0139-0134/174968-1-eng-GB/f0139-012.jpg?t=default_ipad_landscape&ext/f0139-012_default_ipad_landscape.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"1024","height":"643","legacy_id":"18411","is_default":false}],"related_objects":{"image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_9_1496850624.8124","name":"f0148-01","source":"","caption":"<p><b>In Adaptive Mode,</b> your CPU would only receive a voltage boost when it enters turbo mode.</p>\n","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0148-0128/174905-1-eng-GB/f0148-012.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"591","height":"444","legacy_id":"18402"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_9_1496850624.8124","name":"f0148-01","source":"","caption":"<p><b>In Adaptive Mode,</b> your CPU would only receive a voltage boost when it enters turbo mode.</p>\n","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0148-0128/174905-1-eng-GB/f0148-012.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"591","height":"444","legacy_id":"18402"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_8_1496850625.9537","name":"f0147-01","source":"","caption":"<p><b>Scroll down to</b> CPU Core/ Cache Voltage and click the drop-down menu.

This is in part because Windows 10 is integrated with cloud-based features like Cortana, and it has features influenced by mobile such as determining your location. Then there’s Microsoft’s more questionable goals, like scooping up diagnostic data and gathering information for better ad-targeting.</p>\n<p>In previous versions of Windows 10, managing privacy was, to put it mildly, an insane process.

In this article, we’ll discuss the privacy settings users will see on a daily basis in the Creators Update.</p>\n<h3><b>Microsoft Account dashboard</b></h3><p>Microsoft released a web-based privacy dashboard in January. Users will see it more often with the Creators Update, however, because there are more direct links to this webpage built-in. This dashboard includes items such as a user’s browsing history in Microsoft Edge, search history, location data, and the Cortana Notebook.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0152-0132/175011-1-eng-GB/f0152-012.jpg\" width=\"369\" height=\"368\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0152-01\" title=\"f0152-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>The Privacy section</b> of the Settings app in the Creators Update.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div>\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0152-0210/175004-1-eng-GB/f0152-022.jpg\" width=\"449\" height=\"350\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0152-02\" title=\"f0152-02\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>The Background Apps</b> privacy settings now offers a universal off button.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>To access the online privacy dashboard, go to <a href=\"http://account.microsoft.com/privacy\" target=\"_self\">account.microsoft.com/privacy</a> and log in. One of the handiest pieces in this section is the ability to clear the location activity in one click. Go to the location section and look for the Clear Location Activity button on the right-hand side.</p>\n<h3><b>The Settings app</b></h3><p>The changes to the Privacy section of the Settings app in the Creators Update are mostly subtle. There’s the usual left-hand navigation pane to scroll through all the privacy categories, including Location, Camera, Microphone, the new tasks feature, and many others.</p>\n<p>The most significant change is that each privacy screen in the Settings app now has a sub-heading titled Know Your Privacy Options, with a Learn More link underneath. Clicking Learn More takes you to Microsoft’s online privacy pages with a description for each setting. This is the explanation of Windows 10’s general privacy settings (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/w10privset\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/w10privset</a>), for example.</p>\n<p>You’ll find many other new links on the various Privacy settings screens. The aforementioned link to location activity, for example, is also available toward the bottom of Settings &gt; Privacy &gt; Location and is labeled Manage My Location Info That’s Stored In The Cloud.</p>\n<p>One other notable addition to the new Privacy section of the Settings app is that the Background Apps section now has a universal off button.

The default amount of information is Full, and you’ll see that level selected for you in the Feedback &amp; Diagnostics section of the Privacy settings.</p>\n<p>You may, of course, choose the Basic level. You can’t forgo both—you’re going to send Microsoft at least a little data whether you like it or not.</p>\n<p>For more information about the Basic and Full data, start with the article listing the basic diagnostic data (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/bdd\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/bdd</a>) collected, and then move on to the article explaining full diagnostic collection (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/fdc\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/fdc</a>). This information is stored online on Microsoft’s Technet website. Fair warning: These articles are extensive and can be fairly technical.</p>\n<p>The Creators Update doesn’t make any significant changes to how privacy works on Windows 10. What it does have, however, is privacy information that is more transparent, and easier to access and understand.</p>\n","layout":{},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":1,"link_source":"","competition":[],"flatplan_title":"","notes":"","gutter_credit":"","other":"","image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1496850641.827","name":"f0150-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0150-0130/175032-1-eng-GB/f0150-012.jpg?t=default_ipad_portrait&ext/f0150-012_default_ipad_portrait.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"768","height":"432","legacy_id":"18419","is_default":true},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1496850641.827","name":"f0150-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0150-0130/175032-1-eng-GB/f0150-012.jpg?t=default_ipad_landscape&ext/f0150-012_default_ipad_landscape.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"1024","height":"577","legacy_id":"18419","is_default":false}],"related_objects":{"image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_5_1496850636.8021","name":"f0153-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0153-0130/174997-1-eng-GB/f0153-012.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"450","height":"371","legacy_id":"18414"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_5_1496850636.8021","name":"f0153-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0153-0130/174997-1-eng-GB/f0153-012.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"450","height":"371","legacy_id":"18414"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_4_1496850637.7328","name":"f0152-02","source":"","caption":"<p><b>The
