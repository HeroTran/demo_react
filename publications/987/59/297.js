Microsoft also delivered important Windows Phone and app news. Here are the seven announcements we found most exciting.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0007-0120/86198-1-eng-GB/f0007-012.jpg\" width=\"597\" height=\"400\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0007-01\" title=\"f0007-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>1. Windows makes nice</b></h3><p>With the new Windows 8.1 Update, mouse-and-keyboard PC users can finally migrate to Microsoft’s current OS with confidence that they won’t plunge into a chasm of darkness and confusion.</p>\n<p>Nontouch PCs now boot straight to the desktop. A familiar taskbar appears on the modern Start screen. Live tiles on the Start screen now spawn right-click menus, as shown here. The Start screen has an easy-to-find Power button, too. And that’s just the beginning. This update makes a difference.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0008-019/86191-1-eng-GB/f0008-012.jpg\" width=\"597\" height=\"338\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0008-01\" title=\"f0008-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>2.

But that feature is coming: As part of its effort to share its product roadmaps, Microsoft offered a teasing preview of the Start menu’s return, to wild applause.</p>\n<p>Terry Myerson, executive vice president of operating systems, didn’t say when it would come, but he did say it would be in an update pushed to all users.

For starters, Cortana keeps a “notebook” of your personal information and feeds you reminders. It can suss out, say, whether your flight is on time, and send an alert when you need to leave for the airport. It can also block texts during “quiet hours” from anyone not in your predefined inner circle. Is Cortana more powerful than Google Now or Siri? We can’t wait to find out.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0010-019/86177-1-eng-GB/f0010-012.jpg\" width=\"597\" height=\"398\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0010-01\" title=\"f0010-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>4.

The Action Center adds a much-needed notifications shade. New lock-screen themes and customizable Start backgrounds jazz up the OS. You’ll also find a new Word Flow keyboard for fast swipe-typing, and tools for better Wi-Fi management.

You’ve never had to pay directly for Windows on such devices, but manufacturers have paid licensing fees. Now those fees are history. It’s a bold move for a company that has depended on licensing revenue, but it aligns Microsoft with the industry and demonstrates a commitment to transitioning from PCs to handheld touchscreen devices.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0012-019/86163-1-eng-GB/f0012-012.jpg\" width=\"597\" height=\"400\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0012-01\" title=\"f0012-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>6.

Terry Myerson described how devices running Intel’s Quark PC-on-a-chip will enable a new world of connected Windows hardware. The example on stage was a huge piano keyboard like the one from Big. Corporate vice president Joe Belfiore was a good sport, and danced on it—leaving the audience intrigued, a bit confused, and wanting much more

It’s great.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p><b>WITH THE FREE</b> spring update for Windows 8.1, Microsoft is issuing more than tweaks and bug fixes. It’s issuing a message: “We’re listening. PC users, we want you back.”</p>\n<p>The Windows 8.1 Update (<b><a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/win81update\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/win81update</a></b>) is not perfect, but it atones for Windows 8’s most egregious sins, transforming the operating system into a desirable one even for devoted keyboard and mouse users. You have little reason not to migrate to Windows 8 if you’re hunting for a new PC now.</p>\n<p>Windows 8 encountered a fierce backlash largely because it pushed too hard. The changes were drastic—the Start menu was gone, you needed to use arcane commands to summon menus, live tiles were everywhere—and Microsoft all but rubbed your face in those changes.</p>\n<p>No more. Windows 8.1 began dialing back the finger-friendly focus mere months after Windows 8’s launch, restoring a Start button and giving users the (deeply buried) option to boot to the desktop. The new Windows 8.1 Update continues that refinement—and it shines because Microsoft is finally letting a tablet be a tablet and a PC be a PC.</p>\n<h3><b>How does it feel?</b></h3><p>Unlike its one-size-fits-all predecessors, the Windows 8.1 Update adjusts its behavior to your hardware. On a PC, it boots to the desktop, and it opens media files in the desktop-bound Windows Photo Viewer and Windows Media Player rather than the modern Photos, Videos, and Music apps.</p>\n<p>The magic doesn’t end there. The traditional right-click context menu now appears on the Start screen for PC users, eliminating the need to move your cursor to a pop-up options bar at the bottom of the screen when you’re adjusting live tiles.

This universal taskbar is a little rough around the edges—it looks weird in the modern user interface and it covers up interface elements in some modern apps—but it does wonders for fusing Windows 8’s desktop and tablet interfaces into a more cohesive whole. Using modern apps is no longer a cognitive burden; closing them or jumping to another program is now as simple as when you’re using desktop software.</p>\n<p>These changes sound modest, but the new app menu bar and the ubiquitous taskbar improve the speed of my workflow whenever I delve into modern apps. It would be nice to have a way to make the taskbar appear permanently in the modern interface, however.</p>\n<p>Microsoft is also responding to complaints about Windows 8’s hidden menus. The Start screen now includes discrete Power and Search buttons in the upper right corner, and a tile for the modern-style PC settings option is included by default.</p>\n<h3><b>Touchy, touchy</b></h3><p>The Windows 8.1 Update makes even more changes (<b><a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/win81spring\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/win81spring</a></b>), but what’s equally impressive is how seamlessly Microsoft has incorporated these desktop-focused tweaks.</p>\n<p class=\"pullQuote\"><b>The tweaks in the Windows 8.1 Update return the operating system to its roots.</b></p>\n<p>“What we’ve done to make touch great is unaffected by these changes,” said Joe Belfiore, corporate vice president of Microsoft’s operating systems group, while announcing the update at the Build 2014 conference (see page 6). “They’re still present, but not required for mouse and keyboard users.”</p>\n<p>If your device has a touchscreen as its primary input, you’ll still use the same old touch-friendly Windows 8 interface, with the same old boot to live tiles and the same old app options bar on the Start screen. What’s more, the changes in the first Windows 8.1 release make it easier for tablet users to stay in the modern interface without crossing over to the desktop.</p>\n<h3><b>A good kind of compromise</b></h3><p>Although Microsoft is willing to compromise on its vision for the future of Windows in order to appease disgruntled PC users, apps and the modern interface are here to stay—doubly so with the advent of Microsoft’s audacious “universal app” endeavor. The changes in the spring update hide the modern elements elegantly enough that keyboard-and-mouse users no longer need to bother with them.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0017-0116/86234-1-eng-GB/f0017-012.jpg\" width=\"589\" height=\"407\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0017-01\" title=\"f0017-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p>Modern apps are more viable now that they have mouse menus and appear in the universal taskbar.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>In the Windows 8.1 Update, it no longer feels as if your PC is fighting you. You no longer have hoops to jump through before you can use your PC with minimal frustration. Heck, modern apps are finally worth firing up from time to time—and Microsoft placed them front and center by pinning the Windows Store app to the Windows 8.1 Update’s desktop taskbar.</p>\n<p>On top of that, the Start menu and the ability to run modern apps in desktop windows are coming back to Windows…someday (<b><a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/startreturns\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/startreturns</a></b>).</p>\n<p>Don’t let fear of Windows 8’s drastic overhaul drive you away—the tweaks in the Windows 8.1 Update return the OS to its roots. It’s safe to upgrade to Windows 8, though the OS still offers few compelling reasons for satisfied Windows 7 owners to switch. If you already have Windows 8, download Windows 8.1 (via the Windows Store) and this stellar update (which Microsoft is pushing through its traditional Windows Update methods).

It was 12 years and seven months old.</p>\n<p>For now, Windows XP will persist on literally millions of PCs, including those of customers who have either ignored, or were never aware of, Microsoft’s decision to pull the plug. Although the software may physically remain on PCs worldwide, Microsoft has stopped supporting it, leaving Windows XP vulnerable to any unpatched security holes that may arise going forward (<b><a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/xpthreat\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/xpthreat</a></b>).</p>\n<p>Windows XP’s funeral, a private ceremony held deep within Microsoft, was quiet. Microsoft urged customers to donate to Windows 8 in lieu of sending flowers. Office 2003 also passed away, to less fanfare.</p>\n<p>Windows XP gave way to three more generations of Microsoft software—Windows Vista, Windows 7, and Windows 8—and Microsoft has urged customers to adopt its more recent operating systems, which it says offer improved security and a modern look and feel. “Honestly[,] it’s time for a change,” Microsoft stated on its Windows XP website (<b><a href=\"http://windowsxp.com\" target=\"_self\">windowsxp.com</a></b>) in an announcement of the decision.</p>\n<p>The only problem is that many users may not agree. In March 2014, for example, 27.7 percent of all desktop PCs tracked by Net Applications were still running Windows XP. Put another way, Windows XP’s gaping vulnerability was that it was simply too good—it was competing with newer operating systems for market share.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0020-0125/86305-1-eng-GB/f0020-012.jpg\" width=\"591\" height=\"403\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0020-01\" title=\"f0020-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p>Gates called XP “the best operating system Microsoft has ever built.”</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>The operating system Microsoft got right</b></h3><p>Windows XP launched on August 24, 2001. “Simply put, Windows XP is the best operating system Microsoft has ever built,” Bill Gates said at the time.</p>\n<p>Previously, Microsoft had kept its enterprise and consumer operating systems on separate tracks. Windows XP fused Windows 2000 with some of the best bits of Windows 98 and the short-lived Windows ME. It also was the first Microsoft operating system not based on DOS—“the end of an era,” as Gates proclaimed during XP’s launch (<b><a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/endofera\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/endofera</a></b>).</p>\n<p>“It was certainly one of the strongest in terms of market appeal,” said Ross Rubin, who tracked Windows for NPD Group and Jupiter Communications before embarking as an independent analyst. “What made XP really significant is that it brought together the reliability of the Windows NT kernel with the consumer friendliness and driver support of the consumer Windows line.”</p>\n<p>For all of the vitriol directed at the Windows 8 Start page, an early build of “Whistler” (Windows XP’s initial code name) reportedly included that feature as well. But the Start page gave way to a two-column Start menu, a huge hit with both consumers and developers. It was this new user “experience,” code-named “Luna,” that gave Windows XP its formal product name.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0021-0124/86298-1-eng-GB/f0021-012.jpg\" width=\"296\" height=\"226\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0021-01\" title=\"f0021-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p class=\"pullQuote\"><b>Windows XP’s gaping vulnerability was that it was simply too good.</b></p>\n<p>On August 24, 2001, at the company’s Redmond, Washington, campus, Microsoft handed out release-to-manufacturing (RTF) copies of the new operating system to PC makers, who swooped off in helicopters that bore the Windows XP logo. While the company put out the first Windows XP devices on September 24, it released the software to retailers on October 25, to the accompaniment of a huge marketing campaign—by some estimates costing a cool billion—that included a minute-long commercial set to Madonna’s “Ray of Light” (<b><a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/rayoflight\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/rayoflight</a></b>).</p>\n<p>Available in both Home and Professional versions, Windows XP would later come out in a 64-bit version, as well as a Starter edition for emerging markets. Microsoft also sold special editions without Windows Media Player in Europe and Korea, after the company had to pay a $784 million fine for exploiting its monopoly in operating systems to break into the media player market. Microsoft also launched versions for ULPCs (ultra-low-cost PCs) and blade computers, as well as specialized Media Center, server, and embedded editions. That created a significant market foothold for XP, according to Rubin, as many PCs simply lacked the available hardware to run Vista and successive operating systems.</p>\n<p>Windows XP quickly made friends with consumers and professionals alike. Its signature “Bliss” desktop image (see page 25) of green rolling hills became one of the most viewed photos in the world and made photographer Chuck O’Rear the type of money paid for the famous shot of President Bill Clinton hugging Monica Lewinsky. And if users didn’t like “Bliss,” they could select from a number of other themes.</p>\n<p>Under the hood, XP grouped together multiple windows of the new Internet Explorer 6 and other applications, and offered a task-based focus that facilitated common functions such as CD burning. XP also incorporated prefetching to speed up load times, as well as Internet Firewall, Remote Desktop, and Windows Product Activation features. Windows XP persisted through three service packs, adding support for USB 2.0 and numerous improvements.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0022-0119/86291-1-eng-GB/f0022-012.jpg\" width=\"874\" height=\"535\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0022-01\" title=\"f0022-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p>Millions of people viewed the iconic Windows XP “Bliss” desktop.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p class=\"pullQuote\"><b>Windows XP quickly made friends with consumers and professionals alike.</b></p>\n<p>Technical underpinnings aside, what Windows XP did was introduce a new generation of PC users to the Web. Many people forget that the first Windows XP hardware launched under a huge shadow, just two weeks after the horrific events of September 11, 2001. Plus, its staggered launch—hardware first, and then retail software sales—made the later release of Windows Vista seem stronger by comparison. And XP’s richer visual aesthetic initially came under fire, Rubin noted. But over time, users began to love their new OS.</p>\n<h3><b>The faithful speak</b></h3><p>If I asked all Windows XP fans to speak about their favorite operating system, the line would be miles long, as Ian Paul found out when he did just that (<b><a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/xpfaithful\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/xpfaithful</a></b>). So in their place, I asked my father, Bob Hachman—a retired civil engineer who has gone kicking and screaming into the world of ATM cards, pagers, and now smartphones—to speak for the majority.</p>\n<p>“For what we wanted, it’s been absolutely perfect,” my father said, “It’s been very easy to use. We’ve had no problems with it. It’s been very user friendly, from what I can see.”</p>\n<p>My parents’ use of Windows XP is fairly simple: some Web use, Excel spreadsheets, some basic financial planning. And as for security, well, I apparently failed as a geeky son.</p>\n<p>“No, we just use it for very basic Internet use,” my father told me when I asked him if he had set up his machine for downloading patches and other updates. “I don’t even know what a patch is.” Gulp.</p>\n<p>What Windows XP offered was a simple yet broad package to help users accomplish the basic tasks they wanted when they decided to buy a PC: Surf the Web, use Microsoft Office and some gaming software, and hook up a broad range of USB peripherals. Software developers at the time had just two major platforms to choose from—Windows and Mac—and mobile apps were years away. Once Mac users jumped to OS X, both Microsoft and Apple pulled their older browsers.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0024-0124/86284-1-eng-GB/f0024-012.jpg\" width=\"588\" height=\"440\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0024-01\" title=\"f0024-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p>The author’s father, Bob Hachman, poses with the family’s Windows XP PC.</p>\n <span class=\"credit\">\nPHOTOGRAPHY BY KATHY HACHMAN</span></figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>To date, both Google’s Chrome and Mozilla’s Firefox still support XP, allowing XP users to access the Web’s modern sites.

</div><p><b>IT’S NOT TOO</b> far-fetched to believe that a billion people have viewed the “Bliss” image. After all, it defines the desktop view of Windows XP—the seminal operating system from 2001 that Microsoft is at last retiring. But you’d barely notice the real-world scene, located on a small Sonoma byway, if you stepped out of your car and gazed at it today.</p>\n<p>Driving anywhere in California’s wine country can be treacherous. Roads curve back and forth—well, drunkenly. Bicyclists are everywhere, and the next bend could hide an entrance to one of Napa’s or Sonoma’s finest wineries, a tour group jaywalking across the road, or even a couple exploring the area on horseback.</p>\n<p>In 1998, photographer Charles “Chuck” O’Rear was driving from Napa through Sonoma County on his way to Marin County. His mission was to meet the woman who would eventually become his wife. In January, as most California natives know, the rains come, and the hills explode into green for a few months before the withering summer heat browns them once again.</p>\n<p>O’Rear, a 25-year veteran of National Geographic magazine, was driving along Highway 12, saw a vista he wanted to capture, and pulled over. The stretch of the road he paused on is narrow and windy, with only a slender shoulder, and a barbed-wire fence at the bottom of the steep embankment. In 1998, when O’Rear took his famous photo, all he could see was an emerald-green hill, a ridge behind it, and a few puffy clouds.</p>\n<p>“I got out, took a couple of pictures, and kept on going,” he told PCWorld in an interview. “And the rest is history.”</p>\n<p>Fast-forward to the year 2000. Microsoft was about to launch Windows XP. The company had designed the new operating system to have the stability of Windows 2000, its corporate OS, and the consumer features of Windows 98 and Windows ME. O’Rear was one of the first photographers to use a service called Corbis to digitize and license his photos. And Microsoft’s chief executive at the time, Bill Gates, owned Corbis.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0026-0123/86348-1-eng-GB/f0026-012.jpg\" width=\"592\" height=\"446\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0026-01\" title=\"f0026-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p>The Windows XP desktop displays the iconic “Bliss” image in its background.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div>\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0027-0115/86341-1-eng-GB/f0027-012.jpg\" width=\"592\" height=\"355\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0027-01\" title=\"f0027-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p>If the 2014 version of “Bliss” isn’t your thing, you’ll find more-verdant vistas a short walk away.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>“How many pictures they looked at, I have no idea,” O’Rear said. But what he did do was hop on an airplane with the original transparency and accept a hefty check for his work. O’Rear can’t disclose the amount, but he said it was an acceptable amount back then—and remains so today.</p>\n<h3><b>How to find the site</b></h3><p>Since then, the approximate location of the “Bliss” photo has been disclosed: on Highway 12 (where it overlaps with Hwy 121) in Sonoma County (<b><a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/bliss\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/bliss</a></b>). If you’re driving west from Napa to Sonoma, it’s little more than a mile or so past the magnificent Domaine Carneros Winery. The safest way to visit the spot is to park in the next town (Sonoma) and hike back. An alternative is to find a place to turn around and park next to a call box, and then carefully walk back a quarter mile or so. Cross the highway only when no cars are coming. It’s a busy, busy road. You’ve been warned.</p>\n<p>At the bottom of the hill, you’ll need to experiment to find the right vantage point. As you see in my photos, I never quite found a way to eliminate the ridge in the background.</p>\n<p class=\"pullQuote\"><b>All he could see was an emerald-green hill, a ridge, and a few puffy clouds.</b></p>\n<p>What you’ll quickly discover, however, is that the verdant green hills have given way to the region’s cash crop: wine, and the grapes used to make them. The only grasses left are growing at the bottom of the embankment, in company with the rosebushes next to the fence. Unfortunately, the huddle of farm equipment—and a newish house built on the back of the hill—robs the view of its natural beauty. But the local landscape still offers those green vistas, just a few hundred yards away.</p>\n<p>O’Rear swears the original “Bliss” photo appears exactly as his camera caught it. “Sorry, everybody, it’s the real deal,” he said. “Nothing was altered.”</p>\n<p>O’Rear himself has his own technology connections apart from the one he forged with Microsoft. He helped pioneer National Geographic’s technology coverage. His hand appears, holding a Motorola 68000 chip, on the cover of the October 1982 issue. He has shot photos for other stories on advanced materials, as well as a coffee-table book on Silicon Valley. But “Bliss” remains his most famous work, and probably always will be.</p>\n<p>“I got an email from someone at Microsoft—I suspect it was the engineering department—saying, ‘We have a contest going about that photograph,’” O’Rear said. “‘Most of us think it was Photoshopped. Some of us think it was taken out in eastern Washington in the Palouse area. Tell us about it.’ I wrote back and said, ‘Sorry, it’s the real deal. It was all there. The clouds were there, the green grass was there, and the blue sky.’</p>\n<p>“So the next week I got 100 8-by-10s from them [and the message] ‘Please autograph them and send them back.’”</p>\n<p>As Microsoft continues to rework Windows, so, too, do the owners of the vineyard. The landscape of “Bliss” is almost unrecognizable now, 16 years later. O’Rear said he used to know the people who owned the land, but they sold it to a new owner a couple of years ago. And time marches on.</p>\n","layout":{},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":0,"link_source":"","competition":[],"flatplan_title":"","notes":"","gutter_credit":"","other":"","image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1440185028.2343","name":"f0025-01","source":"PHOTOGRAPHY BY MARK HACHMAN","caption":"<p>Here’s what the “Bliss” site looks like today.</p>\n","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0025-0114/86355-1-eng-GB/f0025-012.jpg?t=default_ipad_portrait&ext/f0025-012_default_ipad_portrait.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"768","height":"488","legacy_id":"8710","is_default":true},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1440185028.2343","name":"f0025-01","source":"PHOTOGRAPHY BY MARK HACHMAN","caption":"<p>Here’s what the “Bliss” site looks like today.</p>\n","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0025-0114/86355-1-eng-GB/f0025-012.jpg?t=default_ipad_landscape&ext/f0025-012_default_ipad_landscape.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"1024","height":"650","legacy_id":"8710","is_default":false}],"related_objects":{"image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_2_1440185026.8417","name":"f0027-01","source":"","caption":"<p>If the 2014 version of “Bliss” isn’t your thing, you’ll find more-verdant vistas a short walk away.</p>\n","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0027-0115/86341-1-eng-GB/f0027-012.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"592","height":"355","legacy_id":"8708"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_2_1440185026.8417","name":"f0027-01","source":"","caption":"<p>If the 2014 version of “Bliss” isn’t your thing, you’ll find more-verdant vistas a short walk away.</p>\n","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0027-0115/86341-1-eng-GB/f0027-012.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"592","height":"355","legacy_id":"8708"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_1_1440185027.6156","name":"f0026-01","source":"","caption":"<p>The Windows XP desktop displays the iconic “Bliss” image in its background.</p>\n","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0026-0123/86348-1-eng-GB/f0026-012.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"592","height":"446","legacy_id":"8709"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_1_1440185027.6156","name":"f0026-01","source":"","caption":"<p>The Windows XP desktop displays the iconic “Bliss” image in its background.</p>\n","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0026-0123/86348-1-eng-GB/f0026-012.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"592","height":"446","legacy_id":"8709"}]},"url_alias":"http://pcworld-us.audiencemedia.com","type":"story","order":"3","folio_number":"25","folio_numbers":"25,26,27,28","pdf_page_index":"25","thumbnail":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0025-0114/86355-1-eng-GB/f0025-012.jpg?t=tablet_story_thumbnail&ext/f0025-012_tablet_story_thumbnail.jpg","color":"FFFFFF","real_id":"8707","main_section_id":"297","ads":[]},{"id":"zinio_59_100340926_1440185029.4335","title":"Meet California’s first Bitcoin ATM","sub_title":"","author":[{"id":"0","name":"MELISSA APARICIO","email":"noreply@audiencemedia.com","is_default":false}],"tag":"","strap_line":"","intro":"","body":"<p class=\"byline\"><b>BY MELISSA APARICIO</b></p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0029-0121/86384-1-eng-GB/f0029-012.jpg\" width=\"863\" height=\"474\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0029-01\" title=\"f0029-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p>Watch the video at <a href=\"http://pcworld-us.audiencemedia.com\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/tktktk</a>.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p><b>THE PROCESS OF</b> buying Bitcoins, the digital currency, has gone from taking four days to about four minutes, thanks to a Bitcoin ATM made by Las Vegas–based Robocoin.

Amazon and Newegg each have hundreds. Individual PC builders also sell Windows 7 computers.</p>\n<p>The phasing-out of consumer Windows 7 PCs means they’re often priced somewhat higher than comparable Windows 8 machines, though. And you have to act fast: The end-of-sales date for computers with Windows 7 Home Basic, Home Premium, or Ultimate is October 31, 2014. Afterward, you’ll be able to purchase only business-focused laptops and desktops (<b><a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/win7forbiz\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/win7forbiz</a></b>) powered by Windows 7 Professional, and those can cost a pretty penny.</p>\n<p>In fact, many Windows 7 PCs available today already stick to the Professional edition: Virtually all Windows 7 PCs from Dell, HP, Lenovo, and other mainstream PC makers are in the business category. Boutique builders such as Falcon Northwest and Origin also offer Windows 7 as an option for built-to-order rigs, but those custom computers start out expensive and only skyrocket from there.</p>\n<p>Consider searching for a prebuilt computer that has Windows 7 Professional installed by way of the downgrade rights from a Windows 8 Pro license. (Just search for “Windows 7 downgrade” on your online retailer of choice.) That way, if you ever decide to upgrade the system to Windows 8 or 8.1 later on, you won’t have to pay for a new Windows license. (See below for more about downgrade rights.)</p>\n<h3><b>Construct your own PC</b></h3><p>First, the bad news: The deadline has passed for buying a stand-alone, boxed copy of Windows 7 from Microsoft.</p>\n<p>Now, the good news: Online retailers apparently stockpiled Windows 7 licenses before Microsoft cut off access. Even better, Windows 7 Home Premium still sells for its $100 suggested retail price.</p>\n<p>Considering that you can still find boxed copies of Windows XP online, you can expect to see Windows 7 on sale awhile longer, though its cost is sure to creep up as availability dwindles. Just be sure to confirm what you’re buying: Some third-party sellers offer “open box” copies of Microsoft’s OS, and you should steer clear of those.</p>\n<p>While despondent Windows 8 owners can install a fresh copy of Windows 7 on their machines, this do-it-yourself option is more likely to appeal to people who are cobbling together their own computer from the power supply on up.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0032-0124/86413-1-eng-GB/f0032-012.jpg\" width=\"729\" height=\"270\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0032-01\" title=\"f0032-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p>You don’t have to search far to find Windows 7 sold at its suggested retail price.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p class=\"pullQuote\">You can expect to see Windows 7 awhile longer, but its cost will creep up.</p>\n<h3><b>Downgrade Windows 8 Pro</b></h3><p>If you’ve purchased or built a Windows 8 Pro computer and discovered that you loathe live tiles, you can tap Microsoft’s rarely invoked downgrade rights to transform your PC into a Windows 7 Professional system. Downgrade rights are a tricky topic, however.</p>\n<p>You need to have Windows 8 Pro installed, and your PC must have run on Windows 8 Pro from the get-go—basic Windows 8 installations upgraded to Windows 8 Pro after the fact don’t get downgrade rights. You also need a product key and an installation disc for Windows 7, which Microsoft and most PC makers will not help you with. The process requires jumping through a series of hoops. And did I mention that some PC builders refuse to support (<b><a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/downgraderisk\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/downgraderisk</a></b>) boxed consumer computers that have been downgraded to Windows 7?</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, downgrading (<b><a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/downgradeinfo\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/downgradeinfo</a></b>) has its advantages over nuking Windows 8 and installing a fresh copy of Windows 7, foremost among them being the ability to upgrade the system back to Windows 8 at no cost if you change your mind.</p>\n<h3><b>Be the change you want to see</b></h3><p>If you don’t want to drop extra dough on a Windows 7 license or to spend a premium on a computer preinstalled with Windows 7, fear not. Tweaking Windows 8 to behave like its predecessor should take less than an hour, and doing so means you’ll get to keep Windows 8’s blazing-fast boot times and other under-the-hood improvements.</p>\n<p>Simply installing Start menu replacement software (<b><a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/startmenureplace\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/startmenureplace</a></b>) will get you most of the way there, but if you want to forget that live tiles even exist, read our guide on eradicating the modern UI (<b><a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/nometro\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/nometro</a></b>).</p>\n<p>Remember, too, that the recent update to Windows 8.1 includes some new features to make the operating system easier on mouse-and-keyboard diehards (<b><a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/win81mouse\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/win81mouse</a></b>). Windows 8 is slowly becoming a little more like good ol’ Windows 7.</p>\n","layout":{},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":0,"link_source":"","competition":[],"flatplan_title":"","notes":"","gutter_credit":"","other":"","image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1440185031.9145","name":"f0030-01","source":"PHOTOGRAPH COURTESY OF DELL INC.","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0030-0124/86427-1-eng-GB/f0030-012.jpg?t=default_ipad_portrait&ext/f0030-012_default_ipad_portrait.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"768","height":"445","legacy_id":"8718","is_default":true},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1440185031.9145","name":"f0030-01","source":"PHOTOGRAPH COURTESY OF DELL INC.","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0030-0124/86427-1-eng-GB/f0030-012.jpg?t=default_ipad_landscape&ext/f0030-012_default_ipad_landscape.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"1024","height":"593","legacy_id":"8718","is_default":false}],"related_objects":{"image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_2_1440185030.6685","name":"f0032-01","source":"","caption":"<p>You don’t have to search far to find Windows 7 sold at its suggested retail price.</p>\n","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0032-0124/86413-1-eng-GB/f0032-012.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"729","height":"270","legacy_id":"8716"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_2_1440185030.6685","name":"f0032-01","source":"","caption":"<p>You don’t have to search far to find Windows 7 sold at its suggested retail price.</p>\n","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0032-0124/86413-1-eng-GB/f0032-012.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"729","height":"270","legacy_id":"8716"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_1_1440185031.2964","name":"f0031-01","source":"","caption":"<p>Online, you can still find new PCs sold with Windows 7, but you have to act fast to get one.</p>\n","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0031-0114/86420-1-eng-GB/f0031-012.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"730","height":"438","legacy_id":"8717"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_1_1440185031.2964","name":"f0031-01","source":"","caption":"<p>Online, you can still find new PCs sold with Windows 7, but you have to act fast to get one.</p>\n","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0031-0114/86420-1-eng-GB/f0031-012.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"730","height":"438","legacy_id":"8717"}]},"url_alias":"http://pcworld-us.audiencemedia.com","type":"story","order":"5","folio_number":"30","folio_numbers":"30,31,32,33","pdf_page_index":"30","thumbnail":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0030-0124/86427-1-eng-GB/f0030-012.jpg?t=tablet_story_thumbnail&ext/f0030-012_tablet_story_thumbnail.jpg","color":"FFFFFF","real_id":"8715","main_section_id":"297","ads":[]},{"id":"zinio_59_100340926_1440185033.0608","title":"See the Web they don’t want you to see","sub_title":"","author":[{"id":"0","name":"CHRIS HOFFMAN","email":"noreply@audiencemedia.com","is_default":false}],"tag":"","strap_line":"","intro":"","body":"<p class=\"byline\"><b>BY CHRIS HOFFMAN</b></p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0034-0116/86470-1-eng-GB/f0034-012.jpg\" width=\"879\" height=\"659\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0034-01\" title=\"f0034-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p><b>CONTENT FILTERS FREQUENTLY</b> control what you see on the Web. Your school or office might block time-sucking sites. A music or movie service may limit its streams to certain countries. An ISP or a government might impose other filters. Travelers often find that they can’t access their digital content from their current location.</p>\n<p>You have ways to bypass such restrictions, but be warned: Network administrators don’t want you to circumvent their blockades. Use the following tools at your own risk.</p>\n<h3><b>Change your apparent location with a VPN</b></h3><p>When you connect to a virtual private network (<b><a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/usevpn\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/usevpn</a></b>), your computer creates a secure, encrypted tunnel to that network over the Internet. All of your network traffic transmits over the VPN, which alters how other entities “see” you online: If you’re in the United Kingdom and you connect to a VPN in California, for example, websites will see you as connecting from California.</p>\n<p>Connecting via a VPN adds some increased latency because you’re going through a third party. Note, too, that all your programs will use the VPN when you’re connected. Enable it only when necessary.</p>\n<p>One easy-to-use VPN is TunnelBear (<b><a href=\"http://tunnelbear.com\" target=\"_self\">tunnelbear.com</a></b>), which does all the configuration and offers 500MB free every month. You’ll blast through that data cap quickly, however, if you stream videos or music.</p>\n<p>If you want unlimited VPN access for free, try ProXPN (<b><a href=\"http://proxpn.com\" target=\"_self\">proxpn.com</a></b>). It offers no-cost VPN access without a traffic limit, but free users don’t enjoy the maximum speed. For unlimited, unthrottled access, you have to pay for one of the many VPN services available.</p>\n<p>To connect to a VPN in Windows, press the &lt;Windows&gt; key, type VPN, and click Set up a virtual private network (VPN) connection. (In Windows 8, select the Settings filter after searching for VPN.) You can connect and disconnect from VPNs via the network icon in the system tray.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0035-0115/86463-1-eng-GB/f0035-012.jpg\" width=\"591\" height=\"390\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0035-01\" title=\"f0035-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p>Changing your PC’s DNS server opens multiple windows but is fairly simple.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>Dodge region-blocking via DNS servers</b></h3><p>If you just want access to region-blocked (aka geo-blocked) websites such as Hulu, Netflix, the BBC’s iPlayer, and other streaming media sources, your best option is a DNS-based filter-dodging service.</p>\n<p>After you change your settings to use the service’s DNS address, it will handle the dirty work in the background. You can then connect to more than one region-blocked website at the same time, and to each site you will always appear to be coming from an approved country. Best of all, you’ll enjoy full streaming-video speeds on those sites. Your PC connects to each site—only small parts of the traffic go through the DNS service’s proxy servers.</p>\n<p class=\"pullQuote\"><b>To access region-blocked sites, your best option is a filter-dodging service.</b></p>\n<p>Services such as OpenDNS (<b><a href=\"http://opendns.com\" target=\"_self\">opendns.com</a></b>) and Google Public DNS (<b><a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/publicdns\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/publicdns</a></b>), which are free for consumer use, can also help you dodge an ISP’s efforts to redirect your search traffic in order to push more ads. Note that these options reroute all of your Internet traffic, however.</p>\n<p>Most DNS services that let you view streaming media sites from nonsupported countries charge access fees. UnoDNS (<b><a href=\"http://unotelly.com/unodns\" target=\"_self\">unotelly.com/unodns</a></b>) costs $5 a month and gives you access to geo-blocked sites such as Netflix. Unblock Us (<b><a href=\"http://unblock-us.com\" target=\"_self\">unblock-us.com</a></b>) is similar.</p>\n<p>You’ll want to change the DNS address on your router, if possible, so that all your devices use the DNS service. If you prefer, though, you can change the DNS address for your PC alone: Go to Control Panel ▸ View network status and tasks ▸ [Your network connection’s name] ▸ Properties</p>\n<p>Internet Protocol Version 4 ▸ Properties ▸ Use the following DNS server addresses. For help, try the free DNS Jumper (<b><a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/dnsjumper\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/dnsjumper</a></b>).</p>\n<h3><b>Disguise yourself with a proxy server</b></h3><p>Proxies aren’t as secure as a VPN, nor are they as handy as a DNS server. But you could use a Web-based proxy to bypass a workplace content filter without changing the settings on your PC. You could also set a browser to use a proxy server for accessing blocked sites—you could even have one browser that uses a proxy server and another that doesn’t.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0037-0116/86456-1-eng-GB/f0037-012.jpg\" width=\"604\" height=\"351\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0037-01\" title=\"f0037-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p>You can use the proxies listed on Hide My Ass, but you may have to change settings often.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>The aptly named Hide My Ass (<b><a href=\"http://hidemyass.com\" target=\"_self\">hidemyass.com</a></b>) is a popular Web-based proxy.

The fixes also involve updates to Adobe AIR for Android and the Adobe AIR SDK for Windows and Mac.</p>\n<p>Adobe identifies each vulnerability by a Common Vulnerabilities and Exposure number: For instance, this particular update addresses CVE-2014-0498, describing a remote execution vulnerability, and CVE-2014-0499, which covers some unsecured code addresses.</p>\n<p>But the third one is the kicker, and the reason why this is an update well worth installing: CVE-2014-0502 involves a bizarre situation in which the same memory is being freed twice, possibly leading to a buffer overflow. You may wonder what that means, but Adobe is “aware of reports that an exploit for CVE-2014-0502 exists in the wild, and recommends users update their product installations.”</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0039-0114/86499-1-eng-GB/f0039-012.jpg\" width=\"598\" height=\"611\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0039-01\" title=\"f0039-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>Make Synology’s VPN private again</b></h3><p>If you read our report on routers and NAS boxes in last month’s issue, you know that many devices leave their data disturbingly easy to access.

At the company’s website you can use WASD’s online designer to choose which Cherry MX switches to use, whether to include O-rings (to dampen the audio level of the keyboard’s clacking keys), what colors to use for its keycaps, how to organize its key layout (if you prefer Dvorak to QWERTY, for instance), and which symbol to print on the &lt;Windows&gt; key.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, you can download WASD’s design file and create something completely customized—a Zelda-themed keyboard, say.</p>\n<p>For my V2 I adopted a color scheme similar to the WASD default: a red &lt;Escape&gt; key and everything else in two-tone gray, with keycaps labeled in Futura font. The case itself is black. Even after months of heavy use, my keyboard shows few signs of wear.</p>\n<p>The V2’s cable isn’t braided, but you can route it through five different channels on its bottom, so it emerges from the center, the top right, the top left, the middle right, or the middle left side.</p>\n<p>DIP switches along the bottom of the keyboard allow you to add customizations that flashier keyboards provide dedicated buttons for. You can configure the &lt;Scroll Lock&gt; key to toggle the &lt;Windows&gt; key off and on, or disable the &lt;Windows&gt; key altogether. You can also remap the keys to Dvorak, Colemak, QWERTY, or Mac mode; flip the &lt;Caps Lock&gt; and &lt;Control&gt; key positions; and more.</p>\n<p>True N-key rollover is supported only through the included PS/2 adapter. USB users are stuck with modified six-key rollover (you can press up to six keys simultaneously, and the keyboard will recognize additional key presses after that). I haven’t had any problems, but dedicated gamers who use a lot of keyboard shortcuts should confirm that their PC has an available PS/2 port (a legacy port that has been disappearing from modern motherboards in recent years).</p>\n<p>The V2’s Home block also functions as a media-player controller: &lt;Play/Pause&gt;, &lt;Stop&gt;, and &lt;Volume Up&gt; operate on the &lt;Insert&gt;, &lt;Home&gt;, and &lt;Page Up&gt; keys, respectively; and &lt;Skip Forward&gt;, &lt;Skip Back&gt;, and &lt;Volume Down&gt; double up on the &lt;Delete&gt;, &lt;End&gt;, and &lt;Page Down&gt; keys, respectively. If you order a WASD board, be sure to have those behaviors engraved on the keys, or you’ll never remember that they exist.</p>\n<p>The keyboard doesn’t deliver much in the way of custom behaviors, and the lack of backlighting is a minus, but overall the V2 is one of the best simple keyboards around. And no other manufacturer allows as much factory customization.</p>\n<p class=\"pullQuote\"><b>The lack of backlighting is a minus, but overall the V2 is one of the best simple keyboards around.</b></p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0046-0124/86605-1-eng-GB/f0046-012.jpg\" width=\"841\" height=\"599\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0046-01\" title=\"f0046-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>Logitech G710 Plus Mechanical Gaming Keyboard</b></h3>\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0046-0214/86598-1-eng-GB/f0046-022.jpg\" width=\"96\" height=\"18\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0046-02\" title=\"f0046-02\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p><b>$130</b></p>\n<p>The Logitech G710 Plus Mechanical Gaming Keyboard (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/g710plus\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/g710plus</a>) is a behemoth that comes loaded with features. White LEDs provide backlighting that is divided into two independently controlled zones. One button manages the brightness of the W-A-S-D and arrow keys, while the other button controls the remainder of the keyboard. You can set each zone to any of five brightness levels (one of which is ‘off’). At lower levels, the lighting for the &lt;Shift&gt;, &lt;Tab&gt;, and &lt;Enter&gt; keys is a bit uneven, but that’s a minor quibble.</p>\n<p>Six macro keys arranged in a column of border the G710 Plus’s left side. You can store three macros in each of these macro keys, and you can switch between them on the fly by pressing a companion key, much as you would change stations on your car radio. Unfortunately, the companion key isn’t backlit.</p>\n<p>Logitech didn’t build any onboard memory into the G710 Plus, so you’ll have to install Logitech’s software on the host PC before you can program the macros.</p>\n<p>The G710 Plus has a row of dedicated media-player control keys—&lt;Play&gt;, &lt;Stop&gt;, &lt;Skip Forward&gt;, and &lt;Skip Back&gt;—on its top right size, along with a broad roller for volume control and a mute button above the numeric keypad. A Game Mode button at the center-top of the keyboard disables the &lt;Windows&gt; key, so you’ll never get dumped back to the desktop in the middle of a game.</p>\n<p>Logitech uses Cherry MX Brown keyswitches, so it’s relatively quiet for a mechanical keyboard. Despite its large size, though, the G710 Plus’s keys are so close together that I committed atypical typing errors even after prolonged use.</p>\n<p>The G710 Plus’s cord attaches to the keyboard with a stiff rubber collar that doesn’t bend easily. It also consumes two of your computer’s USB ports. You get one of them back in the form of a USB pass-through on the board itself; but it’s located behind the keyboard next to the cord, so if you plug a headset into it, the wire will drape awkwardly across the keys.</p>\n<p>Overall, however, the G710 Plus is one of the most restrained and attractive macro-key–enabled gaming keyboards I’ve tested.</p>\n<h3><b>Razer BlackWidow Ultimate 2014</b></h3>\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0048-0210/86591-1-eng-GB/f0048-022.jpg\" width=\"96\" height=\"18\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0048-02\" title=\"f0048-02\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p><b>$140</b></p>\n<p>The Razer BlackWidow Ultimate 2014 (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/razerbwus\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/razerbwus</a>) uses Razer’s own keyswitches, rather than some form of Cherry MX switches. The Razer Green switches that the BlackWidow Ultimate relies on require the same actuation force—a fairly heavy 50cN (centinewtons)—as Cherry MX Blues do, and they exhibit the same clicky tactile feedback. The Razer Greens, however, have a much higher actuation point than the Cherry MX Blues. It’s very close to the keycap’s resting point, and its resistance fades rapidly past the actuation point.</p>\n<p>For gaming—which is clearly the BlackWidow Ultimate’s primary focus—the high actuation point is a great feature. It allows you to double-or triple-tap keys quickly, much as you can with Cherry Blacks. But instead of that switch’s linear resistance, you get the clicky, tactile feedback you’d expect with Cherry Blues. For touch typing, however, the high set is too hair-trigger for the keyboard’s own good.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0048-0126/86584-1-eng-GB/f0048-012.jpg\" width=\"966\" height=\"630\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0048-01\" title=\"f0048-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>The BlackWidow Ultimate features Razer’s standard black-and-neon-green color scheme. Keys are individually backlit, with settings that range from off to excessively bright.</p>\n<p>Five macro keys arranged in a column occupy the left side of the board. You can program these keys by using Razer’s Synapse software. Because Razer stores the settings in a personal profile in the cloud instead of in on-board memory, you must register an email address with Razer and install Razer’s Synapse software on every computer that you attach to the keyboard.</p>\n<p>The top row of function keys have secondary functions, which you activate by holding down a second key. You get the usual media-player control keys, a &lt;Game Mode&gt; key, a key for on-the-fly macro recording, one for adjusting backlight brightness, and one for sleep mode. The keycap for activating these secondary functions is the only key that isn’t backlit, making it relatively easy to find.</p>\n<p>One oddity: Rather than lighting up circular LEDs to inform you that something like Game Mode or Caps Lock is active, the BlackWidow Ultimate lights up icons. Caps Lock, for instance, gets a “C”, while Game Mode gets a “G” with a crosshair. Unfortunately, housing these icons beneath the plastic top renders them blurry and difficult to see when viewed from behind the keyboard.</p>\n<p>The keyboard’s cable sheath is braided and ends in a hard-rubber joint where it connects to the keyboard. At the other end are two USB plugs and 1/8-inch cables for a headphone and mic. The keyboard includes audio and mic jacks on its top-right side, plus one USB port.</p>\n<p>If you’re a big-time game player, the Razer BlackWidow Ultimate might be your ideal keyboard. But I recommend using a different keyboard for evryday typing.</p>\n<h3><b>Feenix Autore</b></h3>\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0050-0217/86577-1-eng-GB/f0050-022.jpg\" width=\"96\" height=\"18\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0050-02\" title=\"f0050-02\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p><b>$163</b></p>\n<p>According to Feenix, the monolith in 2001: A Space Odyssey inspired the design of the slate-gray Autore (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/autore\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/autore</a>). This exceedingly basic keyboard doesn’t have media-player control keys, backlighting, or macro keys. It’s just a pure, unadulterated keyboard.</p>\n<p>The Autore does sport Cherry MX Brown switches, which provide a tactile bump with less click and actuation force than Cherry Blues deliver. It’s fairly heavy, too, at more than 2.5 pounds, and its braided cable (somewhat annoyingly) emerges from the top-right side instead of close to the desk.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, however, this keyboard relies on its looks, starting with its understated black-on-dark-gray keys. So you have to ask yourself, “How much do I like really lightweight, sans serif typefaces? How badly do I want to own a keyboard that spells out ‘win’ instead of stamping Microsoft’s logo on the Windows key?”</p>\n<p>Considerations of style aside, the Autore has little to recommend it over competitors that cost less and offer more features. Whether you’re looking for a gaming keyboard or a restrained office keyboard, better options are available at much lower prices.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0050-0128/86570-1-eng-GB/f0050-012.jpg\" width=\"863\" height=\"436\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0050-01\" title=\"f0050-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>SteelSeries 6Gv2 Keyboard</b></h3>\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0051-0212/86563-1-eng-GB/f0051-022.jpg\" width=\"96\" height=\"18\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0051-02\" title=\"f0051-02\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p><b>$109</b></p>\n<p>The SteelSeries 6Gv2 (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/6gv2\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/6gv2</a>) is built for people who may sometimes treat their keyboard more harshly than they ought to.

It’s not backlit. It doesn’t have macro keys. It doesn’t even have flip-out feet for adjusting its angle. Various media-player control keys share space on the first six function keys, but they represent the only other significant bonus feature you’ll find here.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0051-0122/86556-1-eng-GB/f0051-012.jpg\" width=\"701\" height=\"593\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0051-01\" title=\"f0051-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p class=\"pullQuote\"><b>For all this keyboard’s bulk, you can readily find heavier and more durable models out there.</b></p>\n<p>On the performance front, the 6Gv2’s keys feel very cramped, a practical problem that the keyboard’s nonstandard key layout exacerbates. The | key sits next to the M key, and the &lt;Enter&gt; key is enormous. Such a layout isn’t unheard of, but it constitutes an unnecessary complication. Even after several hours of use, I found myself constantly making typos.</p>\n<p>The weakest component of this durable keyboard is its cheap rubber cable, which has a stiff joint where it joins the keyboard. I doubt that the cord will stand up to much abuse. And for all this keyboard’s bulk, you can readily find heavier and more durable models out there.</p>\n<p>The 6Gv2 isn’t aesthetically pleasing, and it doesn’t have enough frills to justify its $109 price tag.</p>\n<h3><b>Ozone Strike Pro Backlit Mechanical Gaming Keyboard</b></h3>\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0053-028/86549-1-eng-GB/f0053-022.jpg\" width=\"96\" height=\"18\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0053-02\" title=\"f0053-02\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p><b>$137</b></p>\n<p>The Ozone Strike Pro (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/strikepro\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/strikepro</a>) is surprisingly understated for a gaming keyboard. Turn off its backlight and you could use it at work. With the backlight on, however, the W-A-S-D block and the arrow keys light up blood-red. The backlight has six settings: off, three levels of brightness, one level that slowly pulses as though the keyboard were breathing, and one level that illuminates only the red sections.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately the red backlights don’t dim in concert with the white lights. When you use the keyboard in the dark, the W-A-S-D and arrow keys remain garishly illuminated. And the Strike Pro logo on the front of the spacebar is blindingly bright when backlit.</p>\n<p>The keyboard itself is beautifully designed, as long as it’s lying flat on the work surface. Its fixed narrow wrist rest delivers more support than you might expect. During long gaming sessions, however, I found that the material it’s composed of caused the heels of my hands to sweat profusely. And don’t deploy its retractable feet: The Strike Pro is a thick keyboard, and tilting it up by flipping its feet out caused my wrists to start aching almost immediately.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0053-0118/86542-1-eng-GB/f0053-012.jpg\" width=\"863\" height=\"511\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0053-01\" title=\"f0053-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>Worse, though the poorly engineered feet have an antislip rubber compound on the bottom, they’ll collapse if you exert too much forward pressure, crashing the keyboard to the surface of your desk.</p>\n<p>Three channels on the bottom of the keyboard allow you to route its thick, braided cable out of the top center or to the left or right side. The cable ends with three jacks: a USB jack plus 1/8-inch mic and headphone jacks to feed its audio hub.</p>\n<p>The keyboard we tested was outfitted with Cherry Red keyswitches, but you can order yours with Cherry Blacks, Browns, or Blues instead, if you prefer. You can adjust the keyboard’s response time and polling rate directly from the keyboard, using the &lt;Ozone&gt; key that replaces the right &lt;Windows&gt; key. You also get also a suite of media-player control keys, a backlight adjuster, and a &lt;Game Mode&gt; key that disables the remaining &lt;Windows&gt; key and enables macros.</p>\n<p>The Strke Pro’s six macro keys share keycaps with the &lt;Insert&gt;, &lt;Home&gt;, &lt;Page Up&gt;, &lt;Delete&gt;, &lt;End&gt;, and &lt;Page Down&gt; key functions. But Ozone’s macro-creation software is terrible. When you apply your changes and enable a new configuration, the PC hangs for upward of 10 seconds. On the plus side, the software stores the macros you create with it in the keyboard’s onboard memory, so you won’t need to deal with the software very often.</p>\n<p>The Ozone Strike Pro is a solid, if unremarkable, keyboard.

original Kirabook. Okay, I was a lot hard on it (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/kirabook\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/kirabook</a>). In my view, the company’s engineers committed a few critical design mistakes that severely undermined the Ultrabook’s claim to luxury status. I’m happy to report that Toshiba has made amends—mostly. The second-generation Kirabook is better, more powerful, and less expensive. But it remains a few features short of being a masterpiece.</p>\n<p>Like the original, this Kirabook (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/toshibakirabook\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/toshibakirabook</a>) is an absolutely beautiful computer, housed in an elegant magnesium-alloy chassis. Its Retina-like, 13.3-inch, 2560-by-1440-pixel touchscreen display—boasting a pixel density of 221 pixels per inch—remains its primary attraction.</p>\n<p>The HDMI port on the old Kirabook was limited to delivering a maximum resolution of 1920 by 1080 pixels to an external display. The new Kirabook has an HDMI 1.4 port and can deliver 4K resolution (3840 by 2160 pixels) to an external display. But when I connected it to a 4K monitor (Sharp’s 32-inch PN-K321), I discovered that it’s limited to a refresh rate of either 29Hz or 30Hz at this resolution. That’s a limitation of HDMI 1.4 that’s not present in HDMI 2.0—or in DisplayPort 1.2, for that matter.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0056-0129/86676-1-eng-GB/f0056-012.jpg\" width=\"702\" height=\"549\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0056-01\" title=\"f0056-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p>The Kirabook’s battery lasted an impressive 5 hours, 46 minutes with the “eco” power setting enabled.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>That low refresh won’t be too much of an issue when you’re watching movies (although 24Hz would be a better match for films converted to video), and you’ll never play games at that resolution with the Kirabook’s integrated graphics. But your eyes will soon fall out of your head if you spend much time trying to be productive in that environment.</p>\n<p>The Kirabook’s keycaps are about the same size as those on the Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon I’ve been using for the past year, but they’re shaped more squarely, their surfaces are flatter, and they have slightly shorter travel. These attributes made them feel smaller under my fingers than they actually are. I do like the keyboard’s backlight, which illuminates the letters on the keycaps and not just the borders of the keys.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0057-0121/86669-1-eng-GB/f0057-012.jpg\" width=\"522\" height=\"378\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0057-01\" title=\"f0057-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p>The Kirabook wins points for its sleek, attractive design.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>The rest of the new Kirabook’s feature set matches that of its predecessor: three USB 3.0 ports, a microSD card reader, Corning Concore glass over its display, and no hardwired ethernet port. This time, however, Toshiba provides a state-of-the-art 802.11ac Wi-Fi adapter, which is a big boost from 802.11n. Its chassis feels the same, too—including its none-too-rigid lid—and it weighs the same 2.97 pounds.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0058-0127/86662-1-eng-GB/f0058-012.jpg\" width=\"695\" height=\"606\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0058-01\" title=\"f0058-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p>The Kirabook delivered a disappointing Notebook WorldBench score of 40 using its “eco” power setting, but an excellent score of 77 using the “Balanced” setting.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>The model reviewed here is powered by an Intel Core i7-4500U, 8GB of DDR3/1600 memory, and a 256GB SSD. Given those components, I was more than a little surprised by its low Notebook WorldBench score of 40. After all, Dell’s XPS 13 and Lenovo’s Yoga 2 Pro both have the lesser Core i5-4200U, and they scored 69 and 62, respectively.</p>\n<p>As it turns out, the evaluation unit arrived set to use an “eco” power plan (with the description “saves energy using the settings recommended by Toshiba”) that renders the display very dim, even when the unit is plugged in. PCWorld Lab policy is to benchmark machines as they arrive from the vendor, but this “eco” power severely depressed its WorldBench score. When I queried Toshiba about this setting, I was told that the Kirabook should have arrived set to use Microsoft’s “Balanced” power plan. When we changed the Kirabook’s power settings accordingly and retested, the laptop’s WorldBench score jumped to an impressive 77. Since that’s the way it should have arrived from Toshiba, my review score is based on that performance.</p>\n<p>The Kirabook’s battery lasted a very respectable 5 hours and 46 minutes—almost 1.5 hours longer than the Yoga 2 Pro (which has a higher-resolution display), but the same as the XPS 13 (which has a lower-res display). We did not retest the battery using the Balanced setting, but it’s safe to assume it wouldn’t last as long. If I bought this machine, I definitely would not use it in “eco” mode—you just give up too much in performance.</p>\n<p>The Kirabook is an impressive notebook, but it’s also pricey. Lenovo’s Yoga 2 Pro and HP’s Spectre 13t are its closest competitors. The Yoga 2 Pro, with the same CPU and memory but an even higher-resolution display (3200 by 1800 pixels) and more storage (a 512GB SSD), goes for $1599. The Spectre 13t, with the same processor and same-resolution display, costs $1505. But neither Lenovo nor HP matches Toshiba’s white-glove service: 24/7 telephone support from U.S.-based technicians (with call pickup within 45 seconds), setup assistance, annual tune-ups, and paid shipping both ways for repairs under warranty.</p>\n<p>If you crave that kind of luxury treatment, the Kirabook earns its price premium. But I still don’t count it among the best values on the laptop market today.</p>\n<p class=\"pullQuote\"><b>If I bought this machine, I would not use it in “eco” mode—you give up too much in

It doesn’t flip, fold, detach, or do any other fancy tricks. But the TravelMate Pro is light, rugged, secure, and fast.</p>\n<p>The TMP645-MG-9419 version of the TravelMate Pro that Acer sent us came outfitted with an Intel Core i7-4500u processor, 8GB of DDR3/1600 memory, a discrete AMD Radeon HD 8750M graphics processor, and a 256GB Toshiba solid-state drive.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0061-0123/86740-1-eng-GB/f0061-012.jpg\" width=\"702\" height=\"549\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0061-01\" title=\"f0061-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p>The TravelMate’s battery life won’t blow your mind, but it’s very good considering that the battery is powering a discrete GPU.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>The laptop’s quick and smooth performance earned the Acer a score of 68 in our Notebook WorldBench 9 test suite. (Note that PCWorld’s WorldBench scale has changed, and the new reference point is a much faster laptop than was used to produce WorldBench 8 and WorldBench 8.1 scores.)</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0062-0130/86733-1-eng-GB/f0062-012.jpg\" width=\"863\" height=\"450\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0062-01\" title=\"f0062-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p>We expect to see VGA on a business laptop, but this HDMI port surprised us.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>And thanks to its discrete GPU, the TravelMate Pro even managed to deliver playable frame rates with games such as BioShock Infinite and Grid 2 (albeit at a resolution of 1024 by 768 pixels). Still, that’s something no laptop with integrated graphics can accomplish. Video playing at the display’s native resolution of 1920 by 1080 pixels was butter-smooth, but movie soundtracks sounded blah.</p>\n<p>If the TravelMate’s appearance isn’t particularly compelling, its carbon-fiber chassis and all-metal hinges are. This laptop is very sturdy, though the bezel surrounding the 14-inch, IPS display flexes quite a bit.</p>\n<p>There’s at least one design oddity that will irk an IT department: The screws securing the access plate covering the hard drive and memory slots are of two different gauges. Not expecting this, I inadvertently stripped one of the smaller screws. Who wants to change screwdrivers twice every time they open an access panel? Certainly not anyone charged with managing a fleet of notebooks.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0063-0124/86726-1-eng-GB/f0063-012.jpg\" width=\"702\" height=\"549\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0063-01\" title=\"f0063-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p>The TravelMate Pro’s Core i7 processor, SSD, and discrete GPU helped it earn an excellent Notebook WorldBench 9 score of 68.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>A gigabit ethernet port stands out among ports and connectivity options, which are mostly what you’d expect to find on a notebook in this class: three USB 3.0 ports, VGA and HDMI video outputs, and separate mic and headphone jacks. Wireless functions include Bluetooth 4, but the Wi-Fi adapter tops out at 802.11n—we’d be happier with 802.11ac. PCWorld favors DisplayPort connectors over HDMI, but you’ll need to buy Acer’s $150 ProDock to get that. A cheap 0.9-megapixel webcam is mounted in the display’s bezel, with a single integrated mic.</p>\n<p>The TravelMate Pro’s input ergonomics are very sound. The touchpad is silky, and the backlit, island-style keyboard has full-size keys with decent tactile feedback. The notebook is also outfitted with a biometric fingerprint reader and a docking port on its underbelly.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0064-0126/86719-1-eng-GB/f0064-012.jpg\" width=\"616\" height=\"507\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0064-01\" title=\"f0064-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p class=\"pullQuote\"><b>PCWorld favors DisplayPort connectors over HDMI, but you’ll need to buy Acer’s $150 ProDock to get that.</b></p>\n<p>Acer promises that TravelMate Pro models will remain essentially the same for 12 to 18 months from introduction, and that replacement parts will be available for at least three years.</p>\n<p>The unit comes with a two-year mail-in/carry-in warranty, which can be extended one additional year. On-site and other service options are also available at extra cost. This information is a bit difficult to find, as Acer hides it from anyone whose laptop is not registered.</p>\n<p>At $1300, this TravelMate Pro is quite a nice piece of hardware, and it’s significantly less expensive than much of its business-oriented competition. But the lack of a five-year warranty, the shortish coverage, and niggling details like different-gauge screws will irk the corporate element of its intended audience. The favorable price-to-performance ratio makes it a go for independent business users, but for corporate fleets? Probably not.</p>\n<h3><b>Acer TravelMate Pro (Model P645-MG-9419)</b></h3><p><b>PROS:</b></p>\n<p>• Very good performance</p>\n<p>• Long battery life</p>\n<p>• Docking station option</p>\n<p><b>CONS:</b></p>\n<p>• Aesthetically dull</p>\n<p>• Bottom access plate uses two gauges of screws</p>\n<p>• Optional warranties limited to just three years</p>\n<p><b>BOTTOM LINE:</b></p>\n<p>For solo business users, this laptop offers a nice blend of modern features and solid performance.

of memory and storage. So I was happy to see the Toshiba Encore 8 (<b><a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/toshibaencore8\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/toshibaencore8</a></b>), which stands out thanks to its Micro HDMI port and 8-megapixel rear camera. This 8-inch tablet is also chunkier than its competition, however.</p>\n<p>The Encore 8 runs on an Intel Bay Trail Atom Z3740 processor, and it carries 2GB of low-power DDR3/1067 memory. The model I reviewed shipped with 64GB of solid-state storage, a feature that adds $50 to the price. (Toshiba’s $300 base Encore 8 has 32GB of storage.)</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0066-0125/86797-1-eng-GB/f0066-012.jpg\" width=\"717\" height=\"549\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0066-01\" title=\"f0066-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p>The Encore 8’s battery should last through a full day if you don’t push it too hard. Competing tablets are better choices if you need battery longevity.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>Our benchmark results illustrate the sameness of Bay Trail tablets: In the performance tests we ran, the Encore 8 fell in between the Asus Transformer Book T100, which uses the same processor, and the Dell Venue 11 Pro (see page 69), which has the slightly faster Atom Z3770.</p>\n<p>The Encore 8 handled daily tasks smoothly. My only complaint is that its touchscreen was not especially responsive, sometimes requiring multiple taps to register a click.</p>\n<p>On the IPS display, which delivers a native resolution of 1280 by 800 pixels, text and images are clear from a reading distance. The panel offers excellent viewing angles. Streaming video plays clearly and smoothly, and the dual speakers grew loud enough to wake my toddler, who was napping in another room (oops). Audio is thin at the highest volumes, but it doesn’t distort.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0067-0122/86790-1-eng-GB/f0067-012.jpg\" width=\"386\" height=\"278\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0067-01\" title=\"f0067-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p>We snapped this photo with the Encore 8’s excellent 8-megapixel rear camera.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>The Encore 8’s Micro HDMI port is a major plus, as many other small Windows tablets rely on wireless video streaming technology to send the video out to an external display or TV. The port is located on the top (when the tablet is in portrait orientation), along with the Micro-USB port, which supports both charging and USB data connections. A MicroSD card slot positioned on the left side allows you to add storage.</p>\n<p>Most 8-inch tablets have only a 5-megapixel camera. The 8-megapixel rear camera in the Encore 8 takes bright and vivid pictures loaded with detail. It has no accompanying flash, however, so its low-light performance is weaker. The front-facing 2-megapixel camera is fine for videoconferencing.</p>\n<p>Regrettably, the Encore 8 is thicker and heavier than other 8-inch Windows tablets we’ve tested previously, and some of Toshiba’s design choices—such as the silver trim and the cheap-feeling, textured plastic back—make it seem even bulkier. For a tablet that’s designed to be held in one hand, it’s too much. During my testing, the Encore 8 spent most of its time propped up on a stand or lying flat on a table.</p>\n<p>Some of the extra mass might be attributable to the tablet’s larger storage capacity, but it certainly is not attributable to a heftier battery: In our tests the Encore 8 petered out after only 6 hours, 59 minutes.</p>\n<p>A tablet that provides 64GB of storage is likely to satisfy you. If you don’t need the Encore 8’s Micro HDMI port, however, take a look at the Dell Venue 8 Pro or the Lenovo Miix 2 8, which deliver about the same performance in a slimmer, lighter package.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0068-0127/86783-1-eng-GB/f0068-012.jpg\" width=\"484\" height=\"762\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0068-01\" title=\"f0068-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p>The Encore 8 is thicker and heavier than most 8-inch Windows tablets.

Its two-day battery life with the optional keyboard dock is amazing. But I wish it had more memory and storage.</p>\n<p>Running on an Intel Atom Z3770 processor (Bay Trail class), it posted WorldBench 9 test scores that were only modestly higher than those of Asus’s Z3740-powered Transformer Book T100. Even so, with the Venue 11 Pro I felt like I wasn’t waiting as long for things to happen.</p>\n<p>I just had to see if it could run The Sims 3, my guilty pleasure. Most Atom tablets launch the game, but their frame rates are frustratingly slow, and background calculations bog down the gameplay even more. To my delight, the game ran smoothly on this Dell tablet at medium settings.</p>\n<p>In contrast to most Atom-based tablets, the Venue 11 Pro boasts a full 1080p panel. Netflix movies look great on this display, and Windows 8’s modern interface and apps scale nicely. The text in Chrome seems a little fuzzy, though.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0070-0124/86854-1-eng-GB/f0070-012.jpg\" width=\"702\" height=\"549\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0070-01\" title=\"f0070-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p>Don’t be alarmed by the Venue 11 Pro’s seemingly low WorldBench score.

Two gigs of RAM, on the other hand, is a true limitation: Each time I ended a Sims 3 session, a notice declared that I was running out of memory.</p>\n<p>Still, 11 inches is a lot of tablet.

The $160 keyboard dock is an essential accessory for writing longer messages and documents. The keyboard has its own battery, which drains first. I watched several hours of videos, played a few hours of games, and surfed for a couple more, draining only the keyboard’s battery. I worked the whole next day off the tablet’s battery without plugging it in overnight. The keyboard is comfortable, which makes the combination a pretty good laptop. The small touchpad is adequate.</p>\n<p>The pair is heavier than many 13-inch laptops, however: The keyboard weighs 28 ounces, which puts the total weight at 3.31 pounds (without the power adapter). Another problem: The keyboard offers little play to tilt the tablet back.</p>\n<p>In Dell’s $140 Tablet Dock accessory, the tablet sits at a fixed angle, and that worked well enough for me. This dock supplies three USB 3.0 ports, HDMI, DisplayPort, 10/100 ethernet, and analog audio and video connectors. The dock charges the tablet, freeing up the tablet’s power adapter to charge the keyboard.

Yet it has a higher-resolution display, more I/O ports, an improved docking-station option, and an entirely new “adaptive function key” row. Drawbacks include a somewhat altered keyboard layout and half-baked voice-and gesture-control features.</p>\n<p>The evaluation unit that we tested came configured with an Intel Core i5-4300U processor, 4GB of low-power DDR3/1600 memory, and a rather skimpy 180GB SSD. Its delightful 14-inch IPS touchscreen boasts a resolution of 2560 by 1440 pixels and a pixel density of 210 pixels per inch, which is just shy of the 15-inch Apple MacBook Pro with Retina display’s 2560-by-1800-pixel resolution and 220-ppi pixel density.</p>\n<p>The X1 Carbon’s touch-responsive screen is very bright and delivers excellent contrast in all lighting situations. Its hinges permit 180 degrees of rotation. Lenovo also offers this ThinkPad in less-expensive configurations with nontouch and lower-resolution screens.</p>\n<p>The 2014 X1 Carbon is thinner, lighter, and more powerful than previous models, and has a higher-resolution touchscreen display.</p>\n<p class=\"pullQuote\"><b>The X1 Carbon’s touch-responsive screen is bright and delivers excellent contrast.</b></p>\n<h3><b>Robust, but lightweight</b></h3><p>The upper half of the ThinkPad X1 Carbon is fabricated from carbon fiber, while the lower half of the chassis is composed of a magnesium alloy. The new touchscreen configuration is 0.72 inch thick and weighs 3.15 pounds. The chassis has a charcoal-gray nonslip finish.</p>\n<p>The 2014 model lacks an SD Card slot, but it has two USB 3.0 ports, a mini DisplayPort, a full-size HDMI, and a proprietary gigabit ethernet port (a dongle adapter is provided). The new X1 Carbon also supports 802.11ac Wi-Fi by way of Intel’s Dual Band Wireless-AC 7260 adapter. You’ll find a fingerprint reader on the margin of the right side of the deck, next to the right arrow key.</p>\n<p>A proprietary port links the notebook to Lenovo’s new OneLink docking station, so you don’t have to surrender a USB port when you’re deskbound. The OneLink Dock Pro ($180) uses a single cable for power, data, and uncompressed video over DisplayPort and DVI. It has four USB 3.0 ports (one with always-on charging), two USB 2.0 ports, gigabit ethernet, and a stereo mic/headphone jack.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0075-0119/86911-1-eng-GB/f0075-012.jpg\" width=\"499\" height=\"434\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0075-01\" title=\"f0075-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p>This mock-up shows the four adaptive function rows and which applications activate them.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>Mighty morphin’ function row</b></h3><p>Replacing the usual row of keys at the top of the typical keyboard is an “adaptive function row,” whose options (and icons) change depending on the application you’re using—word processor, Web browser, or whatever. You can manually switch by touching the &lt;Fn&gt; key at the far left.</p>\n<p>The laptop offers four sets of touch-sensitive icons: Home (the default set); Web Browser (which supports Internet Explorer, Chrome, Firefox, and Safari); Web Conference (for Skype, Google Talk, or WebEx sessions); and Function (for work with Microsoft Office apps).</p>\n<p>The X1 Carbon’s keyboard offers excellent tactile feedback. I also like the new (and slightly larger) clickpad, with right, left, and center mouse buttons integrated into the pad.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0076-0123/86904-1-eng-GB/f0076-012.jpg\" width=\"282\" height=\"274\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0076-01\" title=\"f0076-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p>Lenovo made various changes to the X1 Carbon, but the signature red eraserhead control remains.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>Voice and gesture controls</b></h3><p>The ThinkPad X1 Carbon’s voice-recognition capabilities are powered by Nuance’s Dragon Assistant (<b><a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/dragonassist\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/dragonassist</a></b>)—and they’re exceptionally good. But unless you work at home or in an enclosed office, you probably won’t use them. And be aware that the ability to recognize your utterances isn’t the same as the ability to do something useful with them.</p>\n<p>You can set Dragon Assistant to run in the background and activate it by saying “Hello Dragon,” or you can leave it off and activate it from the adaptive function row (in three of the row’s four configurations). It will return to sleep on its own, or you can say “Go to sleep” to stop it from listening. Unfortunately, most people will find that they can’t do anything faster by voice than with a mouse and keyboard.</p>\n<p>The X1 Carbon’s gesture controls use your camera to recognize hand gestures. It works with some programs and a few Metro games. Swiping your hand in front of the camera (palm facing out) from right to left is supposed to trigger the next slide in a presentation or slideshow, or move you to the next page in a document. Swiping from left to right causes the previous slide or page to display.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0077-0123/86897-1-eng-GB/f0077-012.jpg\" width=\"728\" height=\"549\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0077-01\" title=\"f0077-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p>The 2014 Lenovo X1 Carbon is slightly faster than the HP EliteBook Folio 1040 G1.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>Where’s the CapsLock?</b></h3><p>Various legacy keys are relegated to key combinations. To toggle Scroll Lock you must press &lt;Fn&gt;-K; to put the computer to sleep, you have to press &lt;Fn&gt;-4; and for Break, Pause, SysRq, and Insert modes, you must use similar key combinations.</p>\n<p>On the original X1 Carbon, you could turn on the keyboard backlight by holding down &lt;Fn&gt; and tapping the spacebar. The new X1 Carbon sets aside a dedicated icon for that function on the adaptive function key row, but that icon appears on only one of the four displayed rows. Lenovo also replaced the &lt;CapsLock&gt; key, with half-size &lt;Home&gt; and &lt;End&gt; keys—opposite where they are on most keyboards.</p>\n<p>You can toggle CapsLock on and off by double-tapping the &lt;Shift&gt; key. Lenovo wisely added an LED to that key to indicate its status (lit when CapsLock is engaged, dark when it’s not). The previous X1 Carbon’s oversize &lt;Backspace&gt; key has been reduced by about a third, and the &lt;Delete&gt; key is to its right.</p>\n<h3><b>Performance and battery life</b></h3><p>The 2014 X1 Carbon earned a Notebook WorldBench 9 score of 64, putting it almost exactly midway between the Intel Core i5-4200U–powered HP EliteBook Folio 1040 G1 (<b><a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/folio1040g1\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/folio1040g1</a></b>), which put together a mark of 61, and the Intel Core i7-4500U–based Acer TravelMate Pro (<b><a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/travelmatepro\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/travelmatepro</a></b>), which came in at 68. All three chips use Intel HD Graphics 4400 integrated graphics, but Lenovo’s is the only one that supports Intel’s enterprise-oriented Stable Image Platform, vPro, and Trusted Execution Technology.</p>\n<p>The X1 Carbon’s battery life of 3 hours, 59 minutes in our battery run-down test is disappointing in comparison to the marks for the HP (4 hours, 55 minutes) and the Acer (5 hours, 55 minutes). To its credit, the battery does recharge rapidly.</p>\n<h3><b>Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon</b></h3><p><b>PROS:</b></p>\n<p>• Robust yet lightweight construction</p>\n<p>• 2560-by-1440-pixel touchscreen</p>\n<p>• HDMI and DisplayPort; hardwired ethernet; 802.11ac Wi-Fi</p>\n<p>• Adaptive function row</p>\n<p><b>CONS:</b></p>\n<p>• Short battery life</p>\n<p>• Unconventional keyboard layout</p>\n<p>• Overhyped speech-and gesture-recognition features</p>\n<p><b>BOTTOM LINE:</b></p>\n<p>Almost everything about the new X1 Carbon is better than the original. But Lenovo’s engineers should have left the keyboard beneath the adaptive function row alone, and jettisoned the laptop’s speech and gesture recognition.</p>\n<p>$1609</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n

It offers a high-quality IPS screen, LED backlighting, and an antiglare feature that many people find desirable.</p>\n<p>The Z Display Z27i also offers far greater ergonomic flexibility than most monitors. You can adjust its height and tilt, and rotate it into portrait orientation. Other welcome features include four downstream USB 3.0 ports and plenty of connection options such as VGA, DVI-D, and HDMI. Although the Z Display Z27i supports DisplayPort, it doesn’t supply the DisplayPort-out connection that the spec’s multistreaming feature requires in order to daisy-chain monitors.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0080-0125/86954-1-eng-GB/f0080-012.jpg\" width=\"125\" height=\"295\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0080-01\" title=\"f0080-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p class=\"pullQuote\"><b>Welcome features include four downstream USB 3.0 ports and connection options such as VGA, DVI-D, and HDMI.</b></p>\n<p>A generous 178-degree range of acceptable viewing angles ensures that people gathered around your screen will see the same colors that you do. The display uses an IPS Gen 2 panel, which blocks less light than earlier IPS panels, helping to reduce power consumption.</p>\n<p>In my tests the Z Display Z27i delivered natural-looking skin tones, neutral grays, and white points that seemed a little warmer than those on my reference display (an Apple HD Cinema). I used the Z Display Z27i as my primary desktop monitor for a couple of weeks and found text to be very legible, even at small point sizes. I liked the monitor’s height adjustment options and its antiglare screen.

target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/msoipad</a>.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p><b>WHEN APPLE ANNOUNCED</b> that iWork would be bundled with new iOS devices and Macs, it seemed to slam the door on Microsoft’s Office ambitions for the iPad. How could Microsoft compete with free apps? The answer: Outdo iWork in form and function.</p>\n<p>Office for iPad (<b><a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/officeipad\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/officeipad</a></b>) consists of Word, Excel, and PowerPoint. (OneNote for the iPad was released in 2011.) Users can download each app, for free, from iTunes on an iPad running iOS 7.0 or above. And each app is free for viewing documents created elsewhere.</p>\n<p>To create or edit documents, however, you must subscribe to Office 365, either the Home Premium tier ($10 per month), the upcoming Personal option ($7 per month), or one of several business plans. Each Office 365 subscription includes at least one tablet subscription, which covers Office for iPad. It also includes Microsoft’s OneDrive cloud storage service. You can connect both your personal OneDrive and your OneDrive for Business accounts, as well as connect to SharePoint.</p>\n<p>Each app allows you to do things with a document, rather than just hunt and peck at it as in Office Mobile on a smartphone. Office for iPad represents the distilled Office, poured into an iOS glass. Frankly, I prefer it to Office 2013, as Microsoft organizes common functions intuitively by way of an icon-laden ribbon. Word, for example, preserves the footnote capability but eliminates the Mailings and References headings.</p>\n<p>Working with text is easy: Tapping once on a word moves the cursor to that location; tapping twice creates slider bars to highlight a block. Pressing and releasing prompts selection or insertion options. Holding your finger down summons the zoom icon.</p>\n<p>For most of my testing, I paired the preloaded iPad Air that Microsoft sent us with a Parle Innovation Pi Dock-It Pro keyboard case. But touch is intuitive for moving images and resizing PowerPoint slide headings, especially as text reflows around resized art. On occasion I had to tap almost randomly to select a field before I could edit its text; but eventually I accomplished what I set out to do.</p>\n<p>Sometimes Microsoft gets too cute. Take find-and-replace: To find a word, you need to tap the search icon at the top right. Then you tap the settings gear to the far left, and only then do you get the replace function.</p>\n<p>Office for iPad retains some of Office’s biggest attractions, including the ability to coauthor documents and to track changes. The track-changes function seems especially well implemented. Printing is a notable omission, but Microsoft executives have implied that the company will add it soon.</p>\n<p>From a features perspective, the Office for iPad apps are just a few steps up from Office Online (formerly Office Web Apps). In Word Online, for example, you can add a shape or a footnote to selected text. The iPad version of Word omits that function, but everything else remains the same between the two. Like Word Online, Word for iPad has a spelling checker but no grammar checker or thesaurus. Some sophisticated section-formatting options are unavailable too.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, you will find some lovely little touches. For example, Excel for iPad has a custom keypad to facilitate data entry and speed up formula entry. The formulas (not functions, as Excel Online calls them) are organized by category, similar to how Excel 2013 organizes them. The templates (16 in Excel for iPad versus 9 for Excel Online) are exceedingly useful, as are the defaults for charts and graphs.</p>\n<p>I haven’t spent enough time comparing Office for iPad against iWork, but you’ll probably prefer Word over Pages, and maybe give a slight edge to Excel. I’ve always been impressed with Keynote, however, and I think most iPad users will stick with it. Regardless, kudos to the Office for iPad team: They’ve made “free” apps that rival anything Apple has created.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n

target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/firetv</a></b>), is the company¡¦s way of planting a flag in your living room. Media streaming is a crowded market¡Xyou have the Apple TV and Roku competing against the Chromecast and Plair, not to mention game consoles, networked DVRs, and smart TVs. But Amazon has packed the Fire TV with enough horsepower and features to put it in the lead.</p>\n<p>The Fire TV doesn’t come with an HDMI cable, but once you grab one of those, you hook the box to your TV, plug it into AC power, and follow the on-screen prompts. It connected to my Wi-Fi network without a hitch; it also has an ethernet port. Its optical-audio port is a nice bonus that lets you route the audio through a non-HDMI receiver or wireless surround headphones that accept optical input.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0086-0126/87068-1-eng-GB/f0086-012.jpg\" width=\"794\" height=\"330\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0086-01\" title=\"f0086-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p>Because the Fire TV’s remote pairs via Bluetooth, you don’t have to point it at your TV.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>The box arrives preloaded with your Amazon account. All of the digital content I’ve bought on Amazon, along with my Watchlist, was waiting for me on the Home screen. Then it was just a matter of adding apps such as Crackle, Hulu Plus, Netflix, Vevo, and YouTube, and logging in to those accounts.</p>\n<p>Inside, the Fire TV boasts a quad-core processor and 2GB of memory. (The Apple TV, Roku 3, and Chromecast each include only 512MB.) Just ripping through the menus and popping in and out of videos with virtually no loading time is impressive. The Fire TV plays videos over Wi-Fi much faster than my Apple TV does over a wired connection, and they’re in HD from the start. If you choose an item from your Amazon Watchlist, or something recommended for you on the Home screen, it loads even faster. Leaving a movie to return to the main screen or to launch a voice search is instantaneous, and so is resuming a video you’ve recently begun.</p>\n<p class=\"pullQuote\"><b>Leaving a movie to return to the main screen or to search is instantaneous.</b></p>\n<h3><b>State your preference</b></h3><p>The Fire TV’s remote is quite the performer. It pairs to the Fire TV via Bluetooth, so you don’t need line of sight to the box. Its best feature is voice search. Press and hold the search button, and at the prompt speak into the built-in microphone, saying a movie or TV show title, the name of an actor or director, or even a genre. Once you choose a video, the first page of results is always Amazon’s offerings (rent and buy, as well as “watch now” if it’s on Prime); you have to click to a separate screen for “more ways to watch,” which includes Hulu Plus results if applicable. If your search turns up music videos on Vevo, those appear in a separate tab.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0087-0123/87061-1-eng-GB/f0087-012.jpg\" width=\"362\" height=\"130\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0087-01\" title=\"f0087-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p class=\"pullQuote\">The Fire TV boasts a quad-core processor and 2GB of memory.</p>\n<p>Although voice search is convenient, it’s limited to Amazon, Hulu Plus, and Vevo. If you’re looking for something that isn’t on Amazon, you won’t find it with voice search. I couldn’t find Hulu originals such as Behind the Mask, and when I searched for House of Cards, it said I could buy the first season on Amazon, but it didn’t tell me I could watch both seasons free on Netflix. Also, while voice search’s accuracy is generally very good, it stumbled at times—no matter how I pronounced “Steve Buscemi,” it never understood me.</p>\n<p>Amazon is working with game developers and publishers to bring games to the Fire TV, and it has even launched Amazon Game Studio to produce its own titles. The first original game is Sev Zero, a tower-defense game with third-person shooter aspects. Sev Zero comes with the $40 Amazon Fire Game Controller, which feels like a slightly cheaper Xbox 360 controller; it connects to the Fire TV through Bluetooth and runs on two AA batteries. Most gamers will want to pick up the controller, which is required for some titles. In the end, however, the Fire TV is not a direct competitor to the Xbox One or PlayStation 4. Instead, it’ll feature the kinds of games you’d play on a nice tablet.</p>\n<p>Speaking of tablets, if you have a Kindle Fire HDX, you can mirror its screen to the Fire TV. The set-top box has a Chromecast-like feature, too: After you install the YouTube app on your Fire TV, you can pair a laptop, smartphone, or tablet to it. Then, on that paired device, you can tap the Cast button in YouTube, select YouTube TV as the destination, and watch that YouTube video on your television.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0088-0128/87054-1-eng-GB/f0088-012.jpg\" width=\"530\" height=\"498\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0088-01\" title=\"f0088-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p>On a Kindle Fire HDX tablet, you can retrieve information about the movie you’re watching.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>Extra screen, extra features</b></h3><p>Amazon also added Second Screen functions. You can fling Amazon video playing on your Kindle Fire HDX to the Fire TV and then use the tablet to control playback or to do something else. The X-Ray feature, which Amazon plans to add by the time you read this, will display IMDb-powered information about the video, such as the cast and crew, or the name of the currently playing song. Amazon says the Fire TV’s Second Screen functions will come to iOS devices later this year.</p>\n<p>The FreeTime feature, also on the way, will allow parents to set restrictions on what their children can watch and play on the Fire TV, and when.</p>\n<p class=\"pullQuote\"><b>Amazon’s set-top box is speedier than both the Apple TV and the Roku 3.</b></p>\n<p>The Fire TV would benefit from more apps, including big names such as MLB.TV and PBS. HBO Go is a significant omission, but Amazon says it’s working on adding that ASAP. More music services would be welcome—and it’s a shame that at the Fire TV’s launch you can’t even access your Amazon MP3 purchases via Amazon Cloud Player (another feature that’s expected to be available by the time you read this). Image services such as Flickr would be good additions, too.</p>\n<p>If you are invested in Amazon’s ecosystem—or if you have a Prime subscription but haven’t had the chance to use the Prime Instant Video library much—the Fire TV is a no-brainer. If you’ve remained ecosystem-agnostic up until now, you’ll probably like Amazon’s box: It’s speedier than the Apple TV and the Roku 3, and its game capabilities and voice search give it an edge. Once Amazon adds more apps and delivers the promised extra features, the Fire TV is gonna be hot.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n

</div><p><b>S</b>ince 2010, Google Apps for Enterprise has offered third-party app integration. In March, Google rolled out a similar add-ons store (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/driveaddons\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/driveaddons</a>) for the rest of us.</p>\n<p>The premise of Google Drive’s new offering is that thirdparty services can create add-ons that bring extra functionality to Google’s Web-based word processing (Docs) and spreadsheet (Sheets) apps.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0117-019/87260-1-eng-GB/f0117-012.jpg\" width=\"747\" height=\"501\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0117-01\" title=\"f0117-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p>The design of the add-ons store is similar to that of Google’s Chrome Web Store.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>Microsoft launched its own Apps for Office program in 2013, and some third parties, such as Avery, have provided Office desktop integration via Microsoft’s add-in program for some time.</p>\n<p>For Google Docs users, the add-on system promises to introduce useful functions such as easy bibliography formatting, label creation, and integration with services such as UberConference and HelloFax.</p>\n<p class=\"pullQuote\"><b>For Docs users, add-ons promise to introduce useful functions.</b></p>\n<h3><b>Adding on</b></h3><p>If you’re already using Google Drive’s Docs and Sheets, the add-ons should be available to you automatically. Installing add-ons is pretty straightforward, but spreadsheet users have one minor hurdle to overcome: To use add-ons, you need to update to the Sheets refresh (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/sheetsupdate\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/sheetsupdate</a>) that Google introduced in December, if you haven’t already done so.</p>\n<p>Start by clicking the Add-ons menu item at the top and selecting Get add-ons from the drop-down menu. Whether you’re in a word processing document or in a spreadsheet, the procedure is the same.</p>\n<p class=\"pullQuote\"><b>Right now most of the apps appear to be free, but that might change in the future.</b></p>\n<p>A pop-up window shows all of the add-ons available. The design of the add-ons store is similar to that of Google’s Chrome Web Store.</p>\n<p>Just select the app you want to add, and click the blue price button to install. Right now most of the apps appear to be free, but perhaps that will change in the future.</p>\n<p>After you click the installation button, a permissions window comes up to disclose all the types of data the app will have access to. If you approve of the permissions the app needs, click Accept.</p>\n<p>Finally, you’ll return to the word processing or spreadsheet app where you began, and in a few seconds the add-on will be installed. A balloon will drop down notifying you that the add-on is ready to use.</p>\n<p>Whenever you need to tweak an installed app, simply select Manage add-ons from the Add-ons drop-down menu. Since Google Drive is Web-based, any apps you decide to install will be available in Google Drive across all of your computers.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n

alt=\"f0119-01\" title=\"f0119-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p>A new PC will work well out of the box, but some tweaks will make it even better.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p><b>WHETHER YOU’RE UNBOXING</b> a new PC or freshly installing Windows on older hardware, your job isn’t done when you boot up your desktop for the first time.</p>\n<p>Performing just a handful of tasks can help ensure that your PC stays lean, mean, fully compatible with your peripherals, and all-around pleasant to use for the foreseeable future.</p>\n<h3><b>On DIY machines: Unplug and update drivers</b></h3><p>Feel free to skip this section if you’re using a prebuilt, boxed PC rather than a rig you’ve cobbled together yourself.</p>\n<p>Upon first boot, Windows 8.1 will contact the Windows Update site (unless otherwise configured) and install the drivers it finds for whatever components it recognizes in a system. This automatic procedure can be helpful for obscure components with drivers that don’t see frequent updates, such as a network controller or a keyboard. In contrast, however, it can be an annoyance for more critical parts, such as a GPU or a storage controller.</p>\n<p>During a recent installation of Windows 8.1 that I performed on a test machine, for example, Windows started installing a graphics driver automatically in the background, while I already had a more recent version running. I spent the next half hour cleaning up the mess and starting over.</p>\n<p>To prevent Windows Update or any other auto-updaters from running, disconnect from the Internet before booting Windows for the first time. Then, manually update all of your drivers yourself. Nvidia, AMD, and Intel often update graphics, chipset, and storage drivers on their websites well before Windows Update grabs them. You’ll need to have another Web-connected PC available to download the drivers, of course, and you can move them to your new PC on portable storage.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0120-016/87310-1-eng-GB/f0120-012.jpg\" width=\"449\" height=\"304\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0120-01\" title=\"f0120-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p>For graphics cards and other critical parts, you may want to update the drivers manually.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>Take out the trash</b></h3><p>Store-bought systems typically ship with a bucket of bloatware preinstalled at the factory. Unless a particular preinstalled program catches your eye, get rid of it.</p>\n<p>First, run a tool such as the amazing PC Decrapifier (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/decrapifier\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/decrapifier</a>) to automate the cleaning of known bloatware. Then open the Control Panel, head to Programs ▸ Programs and Features, and work your way through the list of currently installed programs, removing anything you’re unlikely to use.</p>\n<p>While you’re at it, fire up the Windows 8 Task Manager (&lt;Crtl&gt;-&lt;Shift&gt;-&lt;Esc&gt;), click the Startup tab, and disable any background programs that you don’t want to run when Windows launches. (If you’re using an older Windows, search for .............. in the Start menu and look under the Startup tab there.) Disabling unnecessary programs will free up resources as well as speed up boot time.</p>\n<p>Regular housekeeping over the life of the computer won’t hurt, either. Windows itself can hog up a fair bit of drive space with temporary and junk files.

Continue to run Windows Update repeatedly—restarting the PC when necessary—until it lists no more critical updates for your system. Once that’s done, opt to have your computer automatically install Windows Updates as they become available, unless you have a compelling reason to avoid that setting.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0122-017/87296-1-eng-GB/f0122-012.jpg\" width=\"612\" height=\"411\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0122-01\" title=\"f0122-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p>A good security utility or suite is a must for any PC.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>Install your apps</b></h3><p>Install applications only after updating Windows, to ensure that you have the latest compatibility patches—something that is especially important with a fledgling OS such as Windows 8.1. Wondering what to grab? See our guide to 22 free programs to install on your new PC (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/22programs\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/22programs</a>). The nifty Ninite (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/ninite\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/ninite</a>) automates the installation of many popular apps, saving you time. Install security and antivirus tools, of course. And snag Secunia Personal Software Inspector (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/secunia_psi\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/secunia_psi</a>), a tool that keeps your other apps current.</p>\n<h3><b>Back up, back up, back up</b></h3><p>Back up your new PC, and make it an ongoing habit. I suggest using Windows’ imaging tool (<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/freebackup\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/freebackup</a>) or a similar thirdparty utility to take a complete snapshot of the OS volume and then squirreling it away, in case you need to return the Windows installation to like-new condition. Keep this image separate from your regular backups.</p>\n<p>With a backup in hand, the bloatware gone, the awesomeware installed, and everything patched, your new PC should be ready to go!</p>\n","layout":{},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":0,"link_source":"","competition":[],"flatplan_title":"","notes":"","gutter_credit":"","other":"","image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1440185092.0411","name":"f0119-01","source":"","caption":"<p>A new PC will work well out of the box, but some tweaks will make it even better.</p>\n","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0119-018/87317-1-eng-GB/f0119-012.jpg?t=default_ipad_portrait&ext/f0119-012_default_ipad_portrait.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"768","height":"494","legacy_id":"8828","is_default":true},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1440185092.0411","name":"f0119-01","source":"","caption":"<p>A new PC will work well out of the box, but some tweaks will make it even better.</p>\n","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0119-018/87317-1-eng-GB/f0119-012.jpg?t=default_ipad_landscape&ext/f0119-012_default_ipad_landscape.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"1024","height":"659","legacy_id":"8828","is_default":false}],"related_objects":{"image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_3_1440185090.3131","name":"f0122-01","source":"","caption":"<p>A good security utility or suite is a must for any PC.</p>\n","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0122-017/87296-1-eng-GB/f0122-012.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"612","height":"411","legacy_id":"8825"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_3_1440185090.3131","name":"f0122-01","source":"","caption":"<p>A good security utility or suite is a must for any PC.</p>\n","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0122-017/87296-1-eng-GB/f0122-012.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"612","height":"411","legacy_id":"8825"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_2_1440185090.8847","name":"f0121-01","source":"","caption":"<p>PC Decrapifier efficiently erases known bloatware.</p>\n","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0121-017/87303-1-eng-GB/f0121-012.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"730","height":"530","legacy_id":"8826"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_2_1440185090.8847","name":"f0121-01","source":"","caption":"<p>PC Decrapifier efficiently erases known bloatware.</p>\n","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0121-017/87303-1-eng-GB/f0121-012.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"730","height":"530","legacy_id":"8826"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_1_1440185091.4708","name":"f0120-01","source":"","caption":"<p>For graphics cards and other critical parts, you may want to update the drivers manually.</p>\n","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0120-016/87310-1-eng-GB/f0120-012.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"449","height":"304","legacy_id":"8827"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_1_1440185091.4708","name":"f0120-01","source":"","caption":"<p>For graphics cards and other critical parts, you may want to update the drivers manually.</p>\n","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0120-016/87310-1-eng-GB/f0120-012.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"449","height":"304","legacy_id":"8827"}]},"url_alias":"http://pcworld-us.audiencemedia.com","type":"story","order":"20","folio_number":"119","folio_numbers":"119,120,121,122","pdf_page_index":"119","thumbnail":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0119-018/87317-1-eng-GB/f0119-012.jpg?t=tablet_story_thumbnail&ext/f0119-012_tablet_story_thumbnail.jpg","color":"FFFFFF","real_id":"8824","main_section_id":"297","ads":[]}],"type":null,"ads":[]}}
