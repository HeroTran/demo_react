Vlookup</b></h3><p><b>VLOOKUP HELPS</b> YOU herd data that is scattered across different Excel sheets and workbooks, and bring those sheets into a central location to create reports and summaries.</p>\n<p>Let’s suppose that you work with products in a retail store. Each product typically has a unique inventory number, and you can use that number as your reference point for Vlookups. The Vlookup formula matches the ID to the corresponding ID in another sheet, so you can pull the item’s description, price, inventory level, and other data points into your current workbook.</p>\n<p><b>Summon the Vlookup</b> formula in the formula menu, and enter the cell containing your reference number <b>(1)</b>. Then enter the range of cells in the sheet or workbook that you need to pull data from <b>(2)</b>, the column number for the data point you’re looking for <b>(3)</b>, and either True, if you want the closest reference match, or False, if you need an exact match <b>(4)</b>.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0093-0120/87167-1-eng-GB/f0093-012.jpg\" width=\"743\" height=\"603\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0093-01\" title=\"f0093-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p>Excel 2013 includes Recommended Charts with layouts based on the type of data you’re working with.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>2. Creating charts</b></h3><p><b>TO CREATE A CHART,</b> enter data into Excel with column headers <b>(1)</b>, and then select Insert ▸ Chart ▸ Chart Type <b>(2)</b>. Excel 2013 even includes a Recommended Charts section <b>(3)</b> with layouts based on the type of data you’re working with. After creating the generic version of a chart, open the Chart Tools menus to customize it. You’ll find a surprising number of options to play around with in those menus.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0094-0113/87160-1-eng-GB/f0094-012.jpg\" width=\"702\" height=\"489\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0094-01\" title=\"f0094-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p>IF formulas let you pull in just the data you need.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>3. IF and IFERROR formulas</b></h3><p><b>IF AND IFERROR</b> are the two most useful types of IF formulas in Excel. IF lets you use conditional formulas that calculate in one way when a certain thing is true, and in another way when that thing is false. For example, you can identify students who scored 80 points or higher on an exam by having the cell report ‘Pass’ if the score in column C is above 80, and ‘Fail’ if it’s 79 or below.</p>\n<p>IFERROR is a variant of the standard IF formula. It permits you to return a particular value (or a blank value) if the formula you’re trying to use returns an error. If you’re running a Vlookup to another sheet or table, for example, the IFERROR formula can render the field blank in any instance where the Vlookup can’t find the reference.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0095-0111/87153-1-eng-GB/f0095-012.jpg\" width=\"768\" height=\"500\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0095-01\" title=\"f0095-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p>PivotTables are a summarization tool for performing calculations based on reference points that you enter.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>4. PivotTable</b></h3><p><b>A PIVOTTABLE IS</b> essentially a summary table that lets you count, average, sum, and perform other calculations based on reference points that you enter. Excel 2013 added Recommended PivotTables, making it even easier for you to create a table that displays the data you need.</p>\n<p>For example, to count the number of passes and fails in a chart, put your Pass/Fail column in the Row Labels tab <b>(1)</b>, and then again in the Values section of your PivotTable <b>(2)</b>. It will usually default to the correct summary type (‘count’, in this case), but you can choose among many other functions in the Values dropdown box <b>(3)</b>. You can also create subtables that summarize data by category—such as Pass/Fail numbers by gender.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0096-0128/87146-1-eng-GB/f0096-012.jpg\" width=\"726\" height=\"521\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0096-01\" title=\"f0096-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p>PivotCharts help you easily digest complex data.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>5. PivotChart</b></h3><p><b>PART PIVOTTABLE, PART</b> traditional Excel chart, a PivotChart lets you quickly and easily look at complex data sets in an easy-to-digest way. PivotCharts have many of the same functions as traditional charts, with data series, categories, and the like, but they add interactive filters so you can browse through data subsets.</p>\n<p>Excel 2013 added Recommended PivotCharts, which you can find listed under the Recommended Charts icon in the Charts area of the Insert tab.

This service differs from mainstream cloud storage providers in two ways:</p>\n<p>Client-side encryption of files: It encrypts all of your files locally on your device before sending them to the cloud, which ensures that, even with a nonencrypted transfer, no readable data will leak out. This process is even more secure than a secure transfer, because nobody but you ever has access to your data.</p>\n<p><b>Zero-knowledge password policy:</b> Only you know your password, and therefore only you can access your account. Wuala’s employees cannot see your password, nor can they see anything about your data other than how many files you have and how much storage space the files take up. So even if the government came knocking on Wuala’s door and asked the company to turn over your files, it simply wouldn’t be able to do so. Nor will you be able to get to your stuff if you forget your password, however, so safeguard it carefully.</p>\n<p>Security aside, Wuala operates like the cloud storage services you’re used to. Simply download Wuala’s application, and the service will install a special sync folder on your device, where you can drag and drop files to store both locally and in the cloud. Wuala also offers backup and versioning, which means you’ll be able to access previous versions of files or restore files should you accidentally delete them. Like other cloud storage providers, Wuala offers 5GB of storage for free. Pricing plans start at 20GB for $4 per month.</p>\n<p class=\"pullQuote\"><b>Only you know your password, so only you can access your account: Wuala’s employees can’t see the data.</b></p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0109-018/87217-1-eng-GB/f0109-012.jpg\" width=\"426\" height=\"618\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0109-01\" title=\"f0109-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p>Tresorit lets you secure any folder on your device, not just special ones the service creates.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>TRESORIT</b></h3><p><b>PRICE:</b> 5GB free; plans start at 20GB for $8 a month</p>\n<p><b>PLATFORMS:</b> Windows, Mac OS X, iOS, Android</p>\n<p>Tresorit (<b><a href=\"http://tresorit.com\" target=\"_self\">tresorit.com</a></b>) is a cloud storage provider that claims to offer “a truly secure cloud storage service.” Security features include client-side encryption, secure data transfer, and secure data centers that are equipped with physical security measures against intrusion as well as uninterruptible power and backup systems.</p>\n<p>Like Wuala, Tresorit encrypts your data on your local machine to ensure that your files are protected at all times. It, too, practices a zero-knowledge password policy, which means that nobody in the company can ever access your password or decryption keys. Of course, the drawback of such a policy is that if you forget your password, you’re out of luck (you’ll have to create a new account, and you’ll lose all of your data in the cloud).</p>\n<p>Tresorit’s main difference from Wuala, and other mainstream cloud storage services, is that it lets you turn any folder on your device into a secure tresor—German for “vault” or “safe.” What this means is that you do not have to drag and drop files into a special sync folder. Instead, you can simply right-click on an existing folder and “tresor it.” This is especially convenient if you’re digitally organized and you’d prefer not to rearrange your files into one sync folder.</p>\n<p class=\"pullQuote\"><b>Security features include client-side encryption, secure data transfer, and physically secured data centers.</b></p>\n<p>Tresor offers 5GB of space for free.

It stores up to 1GB of data, which you can access from anywhere-but only after you’ve jumped through a series of security hoops.</p>\n<p>The app requires voice recognition, biometric data (facial recognition), and a PIN to verify your identity before giving you access to your files. Every. Single. Time. You can choose to set certain files as low priority (you just have to enter a PIN to access them), but where’s the fun in that?</p>\n<p>While it’s definitely not the sort of service you’d want to use for everyday cloud storage, Personal Locker would work well for sensitive documents that you may need to access from anywhere, such as legal documents, medical records, or copies of your passport or birth certificate. Personal Locker is free with a subscription to McAfee LiveSafe (<b><a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/livesafereview\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/livesafereview</a></b>), which costs $80 per year (<b><a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/mcafeelivesafe\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/mcafeelivesafe</a></b>).</p>\n<p class=\"pullQuote\"><b>The app requires voice recognition, biometric data, and a PIN to verify your identity before giving you access.</b></p>\n<h3><b>ENCRYPT FILES LOCALLY</b></h3><p>Depending on your current situation, switching to a different cloud storage provider can be frustrating, time-consuming, and potentially more expensive-especially when providers such as Copy (<b><a href=\"http://www.copy.com\" target=\"_self\">www.copy.com</a></b>) offer 15GB of free storage (and sometimes more) right off the bat. If you’d rather not start from scratch, you can still rely on client-side encryption to keep your files safe and secure, while continuing to use your insecure, mainstream cloud storage provider. Applications such as TrueCrypt (donation requested; <b><a href=\"http://www.truecrypt.org\" target=\"_self\">www.truecrypt.org</a></b>), for instance, will let you encrypt your files inside your Dropbox folder. You’ll need to install TrueCrypt on any device you want to access the files from.
