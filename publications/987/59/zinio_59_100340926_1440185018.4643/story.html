<p><b>The taskbar</b> appears system wide in the Windows 8.1 Update, even in Modern apps. It’s great.</p>

    </div><p><b>WITH THE FREE</b> spring update for Windows 8.1, Microsoft is issuing more than tweaks and bug fixes. It’s issuing a message: “We’re listening. PC users, we want you back.”</p>
<p>The Windows 8.1 Update (<b><a href="http://go.pcworld.com/win81update" target="_self">go.pcworld.com/win81update</a></b>) is not perfect, but it atones for Windows 8’s most egregious sins, transforming the operating system into a desirable one even for devoted keyboard and mouse users. You have little reason not to migrate to Windows 8 if you’re hunting for a new PC now.</p>
<p>Windows 8 encountered a fierce backlash largely because it pushed too hard. The changes were drastic—the Start menu was gone, you needed to use arcane commands to summon menus, live tiles were everywhere—and Microsoft all but rubbed your face in those changes.</p>
<p>No more. Windows 8.1 began dialing back the finger-friendly focus mere months after Windows 8’s launch, restoring a Start button and giving users the (deeply buried) option to boot to the desktop. The new Windows 8.1 Update continues that refinement—and it shines because Microsoft is finally letting a tablet be a tablet and a PC be a PC.</p>
<h3><b>How does it feel?</b></h3><p>Unlike its one-size-fits-all predecessors, the Windows 8.1 Update adjusts its behavior to your hardware. On a PC, it boots to the desktop, and it opens media files in the desktop-bound Windows Photo Viewer and Windows Media Player rather than the modern Photos, Videos, and Music apps.</p>
<p>The magic doesn’t end there. The traditional right-click context menu now appears on the Start screen for PC users, eliminating the need to move your cursor to a pop-up options bar at the bottom of the screen when you’re adjusting live tiles. And you can say sayonara to Windows 8’s awkward click-and-drag controls for resizing modern apps, too: A mouse-friendly menu bar up top now gives options for closing, “snap” multitasking, and minimizing the apps with a click.</p>

<p>The addition of a mouse-friendly menu bar in Metro apps is much appreciated.</p>
</figcaption>
    
    
    
    </div><p>Yes, minimizing. The Windows 8.1 Update shows open modern apps in the desktop taskbar, though you can disable the feature. They behave just like traditional desktop programs down there, with support for pinning, jump lists, and peeking.</p>

                                                                                                                                            <img src="/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0016-0128/86241-1-eng-GB/f0016-012.jpg" width="418" height="242"  style="border: 0px  ;" alt="f0016-01" title="f0016-01" />
        		<figcaption style="display:none">
<p>The Start screen now offers easy-to-find Power and Search buttons at the upper right.</p>
</figcaption>
    
    
    
    </div><p>Speaking of the taskbar, it now appears everywhere: Moving your pointer to the bottom of the screen causes the taskbar to pop up even in modern apps and the Start screen. This universal taskbar is a little rough around the edges—it looks weird in the modern user interface and it covers up interface elements in some modern apps—but it does wonders for fusing Windows 8’s desktop and tablet interfaces into a more cohesive whole. Using modern apps is no longer a cognitive burden; closing them or jumping to another program is now as simple as when you’re using desktop software.</p>
<p>These changes sound modest, but the new app menu bar and the ubiquitous taskbar improve the speed of my workflow whenever I delve into modern apps. It would be nice to have a way to make the taskbar appear permanently in the modern interface, however.</p>
<p>Microsoft is also responding to complaints about Windows 8’s hidden menus. The Start screen now includes discrete Power and Search buttons in the upper right corner, and a tile for the modern-style PC settings option is included by default.</p>
<h3><b>Touchy, touchy</b></h3><p>The Windows 8.1 Update makes even more changes (<b><a href="http://go.pcworld.com/win81spring" target="_self">go.pcworld.com/win81spring</a></b>), but what’s equally impressive is how seamlessly Microsoft has incorporated these desktop-focused tweaks.</p>
<p class="pullQuote"><b>The tweaks in the Windows 8.1 Update return the operating system to its roots.</b></p>
<p>“What we’ve done to make touch great is unaffected by these changes,” said Joe Belfiore, corporate vice president of Microsoft’s operating systems group, while announcing the update at the Build 2014 conference (see page 6). “They’re still present, but not required for mouse and keyboard users.”</p>
<p>If your device has a touchscreen as its primary input, you’ll still use the same old touch-friendly Windows 8 interface, with the same old boot to live tiles and the same old app options bar on the Start screen. What’s more, the changes in the first Windows 8.1 release make it easier for tablet users to stay in the modern interface without crossing over to the desktop.</p>
<h3><b>A good kind of compromise</b></h3><p>Although Microsoft is willing to compromise on its vision for the future of Windows in order to appease disgruntled PC users, apps and the modern interface are here to stay—doubly so with the advent of Microsoft’s audacious “universal app” endeavor. The changes in the spring update hide the modern elements elegantly enough that keyboard-and-mouse users no longer need to bother with them.</p>

<p>Modern apps are more viable now that they have mouse menus and appear in the universal taskbar.</p>

    </div><p>In the Windows 8.1 Update, it no longer feels as if your PC is fighting you. You no longer have hoops to jump through before you can use your PC with minimal frustration. Heck, modern apps are finally worth firing up from time to time—and Microsoft placed them front and center by pinning the Windows Store app to the Windows 8.1 Update’s desktop taskbar.</p>
<p>On top of that, the Start menu and the ability to run modern apps in desktop windows are coming back to Windows…someday (<b><a href="http://go.pcworld.com/startreturns" target="_self">go.pcworld.com/startreturns</a></b>).</p>
<p>Don’t let fear of Windows 8’s drastic overhaul drive you away—the tweaks in the Windows 8.1 Update return the OS to its roots. It’s safe to upgrade to Windows 8, though the OS still offers few compelling reasons for satisfied Windows 7 owners to switch. If you already have Windows 8, download Windows 8.1 (via the Windows Store) and this stellar update (which Microsoft is pushing through its traditional Windows Update methods). You’ll be glad you did.</p>
