    </div><p><b>WINDOWS XP, MICROSOFT’</b> seventh major operating system and arguably the company’s most successful and beloved ever, has met its demise at its creators’ hands. It was 12 years and seven months old.</p>
<p>For now, Windows XP will persist on literally millions of PCs, including those of customers who have either ignored, or were never aware of, Microsoft’s decision to pull the plug. Although the software may physically remain on PCs worldwide, Microsoft has stopped supporting it, leaving Windows XP vulnerable to any unpatched security holes that may arise going forward (<b><a href="http://go.pcworld.com/xpthreat" target="_self">go.pcworld.com/xpthreat</a></b>).</p>
<p>Windows XP’s funeral, a private ceremony held deep within Microsoft, was quiet. Microsoft urged customers to donate to Windows 8 in lieu of sending flowers. Office 2003 also passed away, to less fanfare.</p>
<p>Windows XP gave way to three more generations of Microsoft software—Windows Vista, Windows 7, and Windows 8—and Microsoft has urged customers to adopt its more recent operating systems, which it says offer improved security and a modern look and feel. “Honestly[,] it’s time for a change,” Microsoft stated on its Windows XP website (<b><a href="http://windowsxp.com" target="_self">windowsxp.com</a></b>) in an announcement of the decision.</p>
<p>The only problem is that many users may not agree. In March 2014, for example, 27.7 percent of all desktop PCs tracked by Net Applications were still running Windows XP. Put another way, Windows XP’s gaping vulnerability was that it was simply too good—it was competing with newer operating systems for market share.</p>

    </div><h3><b>The operating system Microsoft got right</b></h3><p>Windows XP launched on August 24, 2001. “Simply put, Windows XP is the best operating system Microsoft has ever built,” Bill Gates said at the time.</p>
<p>Previously, Microsoft had kept its enterprise and consumer operating systems on separate tracks. Windows XP fused Windows 2000 with some of the best bits of Windows 98 and the short-lived Windows ME. It also was the first Microsoft operating system not based on DOS—“the end of an era,” as Gates proclaimed during XP’s launch (<b><a href="http://go.pcworld.com/endofera" target="_self">go.pcworld.com/endofera</a></b>).</p>
<p>“It was certainly one of the strongest in terms of market appeal,” said Ross Rubin, who tracked Windows for NPD Group and Jupiter Communications before embarking as an independent analyst. “What made XP really significant is that it brought together the reliability of the Windows NT kernel with the consumer friendliness and driver support of the consumer Windows line.”</p>
<p>For all of the vitriol directed at the Windows 8 Start page, an early build of “Whistler” (Windows XP’s initial code name) reportedly included that feature as well. But the Start page gave way to a two-column Start menu, a huge hit with both consumers and developers. It was this new user “experience,” code-named “Luna,” that gave Windows XP its formal product name.</p>

    </div><p class="pullQuote"><b>Windows XP’s gaping vulnerability was that it was simply too good.</b></p>
<p>On August 24, 2001, at the company’s Redmond, Washington, campus, Microsoft handed out release-to-manufacturing (RTF) copies of the new operating system to PC makers, who swooped off in helicopters that bore the Windows XP logo. While the company put out the first Windows XP devices on September 24, it released the software to retailers on October 25, to the accompaniment of a huge marketing campaign—by some estimates costing a cool billion—that included a minute-long commercial set to Madonna’s “Ray of Light” (<b><a href="http://go.pcworld.com/rayoflight" target="_self">go.pcworld.com/rayoflight</a></b>).</p>
<p>Available in both Home and Professional versions, Windows XP would later come out in a 64-bit version, as well as a Starter edition for emerging markets. Microsoft also sold special editions without Windows Media Player in Europe and Korea, after the company had to pay a $784 million fine for exploiting its monopoly in operating systems to break into the media player market. Microsoft also launched versions for ULPCs (ultra-low-cost PCs) and blade computers, as well as specialized Media Center, server, and embedded editions. That created a significant market foothold for XP, according to Rubin, as many PCs simply lacked the available hardware to run Vista and successive operating systems.</p>
<p>Windows XP quickly made friends with consumers and professionals alike. Its signature “Bliss” desktop image (see page 25) of green rolling hills became one of the most viewed photos in the world and made photographer Chuck O’Rear the type of money paid for the famous shot of President Bill Clinton hugging Monica Lewinsky. And if users didn’t like “Bliss,” they could select from a number of other themes.</p>
<p>Under the hood, XP grouped together multiple windows of the new Internet Explorer 6 and other applications, and offered a task-based focus that facilitated common functions such as CD burning. XP also incorporated prefetching to speed up load times, as well as Internet Firewall, Remote Desktop, and Windows Product Activation features. Windows XP persisted through three service packs, adding support for USB 2.0 and numerous improvements.</p>

<p>Technical underpinnings aside, what Windows XP did was introduce a new generation of PC users to the Web. Many people forget that the first Windows XP hardware launched under a huge shadow, just two weeks after the horrific events of September 11, 2001. Plus, its staggered launch—hardware first, and then retail software sales—made the later release of Windows Vista seem stronger by comparison. And XP’s richer visual aesthetic initially came under fire, Rubin noted. But over time, users began to love their new OS.</p>
<h3><b>The faithful speak</b></h3><p>If I asked all Windows XP fans to speak about their favorite operating system, the line would be miles long, as Ian Paul found out when he did just that (<b><a href="http://go.pcworld.com/xpfaithful" target="_self">go.pcworld.com/xpfaithful</a></b>). So in their place, I asked my father, Bob Hachman—a retired civil engineer who has gone kicking and screaming into the world of ATM cards, pagers, and now smartphones—to speak for the majority.</p>
<p>“For what we wanted, it’s been absolutely perfect,” my father said, “It’s been very easy to use. We’ve had no problems with it. It’s been very user friendly, from what I can see.”</p>
<p>My parents’ use of Windows XP is fairly simple: some Web use, Excel spreadsheets, some basic financial planning. And as for security, well, I apparently failed as a geeky son.</p>
<p>“No, we just use it for very basic Internet use,” my father told me when I asked him if he had set up his machine for downloading patches and other updates. “I don’t even know what a patch is.” Gulp.</p>
<p>What Windows XP offered was a simple yet broad package to help users accomplish the basic tasks they wanted when they decided to buy a PC: Surf the Web, use Microsoft Office and some gaming software, and hook up a broad range of USB peripherals. Software developers at the time had just two major platforms to choose from—Windows and Mac—and mobile apps were years away. Once Mac users jumped to OS X, both Microsoft and Apple pulled their older browsers.</p>

    </div><p>To date, both Google’s Chrome and Mozilla’s Firefox still support XP, allowing XP users to access the Web’s modern sites. And my father still really has no reason to move. “Everything that’s new—when it comes out, there are horror stories,” he said.</p>
<p>Windows XP totaled 45 million lines of code, the work of hundreds of Microsoft programmers. It will be missed.</p>
