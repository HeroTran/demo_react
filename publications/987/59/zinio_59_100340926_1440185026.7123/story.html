<p>Here’s what the “Bliss” site looks like today.</p>

    </div><p><b>IT’S NOT TOO</b> far-fetched to believe that a billion people have viewed the “Bliss” image. After all, it defines the desktop view of Windows XP—the seminal operating system from 2001 that Microsoft is at last retiring. But you’d barely notice the real-world scene, located on a small Sonoma byway, if you stepped out of your car and gazed at it today.</p>
<p>Driving anywhere in California’s wine country can be treacherous. Roads curve back and forth—well, drunkenly. Bicyclists are everywhere, and the next bend could hide an entrance to one of Napa’s or Sonoma’s finest wineries, a tour group jaywalking across the road, or even a couple exploring the area on horseback.</p>
<p>In 1998, photographer Charles “Chuck” O’Rear was driving from Napa through Sonoma County on his way to Marin County. His mission was to meet the woman who would eventually become his wife. In January, as most California natives know, the rains come, and the hills explode into green for a few months before the withering summer heat browns them once again.</p>
<p>O’Rear, a 25-year veteran of National Geographic magazine, was driving along Highway 12, saw a vista he wanted to capture, and pulled over. The stretch of the road he paused on is narrow and windy, with only a slender shoulder, and a barbed-wire fence at the bottom of the steep embankment. In 1998, when O’Rear took his famous photo, all he could see was an emerald-green hill, a ridge behind it, and a few puffy clouds.</p>
<p>“I got out, took a couple of pictures, and kept on going,” he told PCWorld in an interview. “And the rest is history.”</p>
<p>Fast-forward to the year 2000. Microsoft was about to launch Windows XP. The company had designed the new operating system to have the stability of Windows 2000, its corporate OS, and the consumer features of Windows 98 and Windows ME. O’Rear was one of the first photographers to use a service called Corbis to digitize and license his photos. And Microsoft’s chief executive at the time, Bill Gates, owned Corbis.</p>

<p>If the 2014 version of “Bliss” isn’t your thing, you’ll find more-verdant vistas a short walk away.</p>

    </div><p>“How many pictures they looked at, I have no idea,” O’Rear said. But what he did do was hop on an airplane with the original transparency and accept a hefty check for his work. O’Rear can’t disclose the amount, but he said it was an acceptable amount back then—and remains so today.</p>
<h3><b>How to find the site</b></h3><p>Since then, the approximate location of the “Bliss” photo has been disclosed: on Highway 12 (where it overlaps with Hwy 121) in Sonoma County (<b><a href="http://go.pcworld.com/bliss" target="_self">go.pcworld.com/bliss</a></b>). If you’re driving west from Napa to Sonoma, it’s little more than a mile or so past the magnificent Domaine Carneros Winery. The safest way to visit the spot is to park in the next town (Sonoma) and hike back. An alternative is to find a place to turn around and park next to a call box, and then carefully walk back a quarter mile or so. Cross the highway only when no cars are coming. It’s a busy, busy road. You’ve been warned.</p>
<p>At the bottom of the hill, you’ll need to experiment to find the right vantage point. As you see in my photos, I never quite found a way to eliminate the ridge in the background.</p>
<p class="pullQuote"><b>All he could see was an emerald-green hill, a ridge, and a few puffy clouds.</b></p>
<p>What you’ll quickly discover, however, is that the verdant green hills have given way to the region’s cash crop: wine, and the grapes used to make them. The only grasses left are growing at the bottom of the embankment, in company with the rosebushes next to the fence. Unfortunately, the huddle of farm equipment—and a newish house built on the back of the hill—robs the view of its natural beauty. But the local landscape still offers those green vistas, just a few hundred yards away.</p>
<p>O’Rear swears the original “Bliss” photo appears exactly as his camera caught it. “Sorry, everybody, it’s the real deal,” he said. “Nothing was altered.”</p>
<p>O’Rear himself has his own technology connections apart from the one he forged with Microsoft. He helped pioneer National Geographic’s technology coverage. His hand appears, holding a Motorola 68000 chip, on the cover of the October 1982 issue. He has shot photos for other stories on advanced materials, as well as a coffee-table book on Silicon Valley. But “Bliss” remains his most famous work, and probably always will be.</p>
<p>“I got an email from someone at Microsoft—I suspect it was the engineering department—saying, ‘We have a contest going about that photograph,’” O’Rear said. “‘Most of us think it was Photoshopped. Some of us think it was taken out in eastern Washington in the Palouse area. Tell us about it.’ I wrote back and said, ‘Sorry, it’s the real deal. It was all there. The clouds were there, the green grass was there, and the blue sky.’</p>
<p>“So the next week I got 100 8-by-10s from them [and the message] ‘Please autograph them and send them back.’”</p>
<p>As Microsoft continues to rework Windows, so, too, do the owners of the vineyard. The landscape of “Bliss” is almost unrecognizable now, 16 years later. O’Rear said he used to know the people who owned the land, but they sold it to a new owner a couple of years ago. And time marches on.</p>
