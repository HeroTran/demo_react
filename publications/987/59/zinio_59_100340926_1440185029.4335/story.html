    </div><p><b>THE PROCESS OF</b> buying Bitcoins, the digital currency, has gone from taking four days to about four minutes, thanks to a Bitcoin ATM made by Las Vegas–based Robocoin. Cary Peters, president of Coinage, the operator of this machine, shows how the first Bitcoin ATM works.</p>
<p>Using the ATM, you can buy Bitcoins by depositing cash or sell them from your digital wallet and then withdraw cash. The price of Bitcoin at the ATM in this video is based on the Bitstamp exchange (<a href="http://www.bitstamp.net" target="_self">www.bitstamp.net</a>). To comply with money laundering regulations, users must scan a government-issued ID. Still, the process should make Bitcoin purchases and withdrawals a lot easier.</p>
<p>Robocoin has shipped about 25 Bitcoin ATMs around the globe. “We want to make sure that the users of our Robocoin ATM understand that Bitcoin is high risk,” says Peters. “There are no guarantees. It can go to zero. It can go to $500,000 or somewhere in between. We don’t know.”</p>
