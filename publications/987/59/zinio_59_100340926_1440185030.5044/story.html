    </div><p><b>ALTHOUGH WINDOWS 8</b> drives most consumer PCs sold today, Windows 7 is by no means dead and gone. PC purists pining for the halcyon days of Microsoft’s previous operating system have several ways to acquire a machine running that OS. It just takes a little digging.</p>

<p>Online, you can still find new PCs sold with Windows 7, but you have to act fast to get one.</p>

    </div><h3><b>Buy a prebuilt PC</b></h3><p>If you want a new, preassembled Windows 7 PC, turn to the Internet.</p>
<p>Best Buy’s website, for example, offers about 100 new Windows 7 desktops and all-in-ones. Amazon and Newegg each have hundreds. Individual PC builders also sell Windows 7 computers.</p>
<p>The phasing-out of consumer Windows 7 PCs means they’re often priced somewhat higher than comparable Windows 8 machines, though. And you have to act fast: The end-of-sales date for computers with Windows 7 Home Basic, Home Premium, or Ultimate is October 31, 2014. Afterward, you’ll be able to purchase only business-focused laptops and desktops (<b><a href="http://go.pcworld.com/win7forbiz" target="_self">go.pcworld.com/win7forbiz</a></b>) powered by Windows 7 Professional, and those can cost a pretty penny.</p>
<p>In fact, many Windows 7 PCs available today already stick to the Professional edition: Virtually all Windows 7 PCs from Dell, HP, Lenovo, and other mainstream PC makers are in the business category. Boutique builders such as Falcon Northwest and Origin also offer Windows 7 as an option for built-to-order rigs, but those custom computers start out expensive and only skyrocket from there.</p>
<p>Consider searching for a prebuilt computer that has Windows 7 Professional installed by way of the downgrade rights from a Windows 8 Pro license. (Just search for “Windows 7 downgrade” on your online retailer of choice.) That way, if you ever decide to upgrade the system to Windows 8 or 8.1 later on, you won’t have to pay for a new Windows license. (See below for more about downgrade rights.)</p>
<h3><b>Construct your own PC</b></h3><p>First, the bad news: The deadline has passed for buying a stand-alone, boxed copy of Windows 7 from Microsoft.</p>
<p>Now, the good news: Online retailers apparently stockpiled Windows 7 licenses before Microsoft cut off access. Even better, Windows 7 Home Premium still sells for its $100 suggested retail price.</p>
<p>Considering that you can still find boxed copies of Windows XP online, you can expect to see Windows 7 on sale awhile longer, though its cost is sure to creep up as availability dwindles. Just be sure to confirm what you’re buying: Some third-party sellers offer “open box” copies of Microsoft’s OS, and you should steer clear of those.</p>
<p>While despondent Windows 8 owners can install a fresh copy of Windows 7 on their machines, this do-it-yourself option is more likely to appeal to people who are cobbling together their own computer from the power supply on up.</p>

<h3><b>Downgrade Windows 8 Pro</b></h3><p>If you’ve purchased or built a Windows 8 Pro computer and discovered that you loathe live tiles, you can tap Microsoft’s rarely invoked downgrade rights to transform your PC into a Windows 7 Professional system. Downgrade rights are a tricky topic, however.</p>
<p>You need to have Windows 8 Pro installed, and your PC must have run on Windows 8 Pro from the get-go—basic Windows 8 installations upgraded to Windows 8 Pro after the fact don’t get downgrade rights. You also need a product key and an installation disc for Windows 7, which Microsoft and most PC makers will not help you with. The process requires jumping through a series of hoops. And did I mention that some PC builders refuse to support (<b><a href="http://go.pcworld.com/downgraderisk" target="_self">go.pcworld.com/downgraderisk</a></b>) boxed consumer computers that have been downgraded to Windows 7?</p>
<p>Nevertheless, downgrading (<b><a href="http://go.pcworld.com/downgradeinfo" target="_self">go.pcworld.com/downgradeinfo</a></b>) has its advantages over nuking Windows 8 and installing a fresh copy of Windows 7, foremost among them being the ability to upgrade the system back to Windows 8 at no cost if you change your mind.</p>
<h3><b>Be the change you want to see</b></h3><p>If you don’t want to drop extra dough on a Windows 7 license or to spend a premium on a computer preinstalled with Windows 7, fear not. Tweaking Windows 8 to behave like its predecessor should take less than an hour, and doing so means you’ll get to keep Windows 8’s blazing-fast boot times and other under-the-hood improvements.</p>
<p>Simply installing Start menu replacement software (<b><a href="http://go.pcworld.com/startmenureplace" target="_self">go.pcworld.com/startmenureplace</a></b>) will get you most of the way there, but if you want to forget that live tiles even exist, read our guide on eradicating the modern UI (<b><a href="http://go.pcworld.com/nometro" target="_self">go.pcworld.com/nometro</a></b>).</p>
<p>Remember, too, that the recent update to Windows 8.1 includes some new features to make the operating system easier on mouse-and-keyboard diehards (<b><a href="http://go.pcworld.com/win81mouse" target="_self">go.pcworld.com/win81mouse</a></b>). Windows 8 is slowly becoming a little more like good ol’ Windows 7.</p>
