    </div><p><b>CONTENT FILTERS FREQUENTLY</b> control what you see on the Web. Your school or office might block time-sucking sites. A music or movie service may limit its streams to certain countries. An ISP or a government might impose other filters. Travelers often find that they can’t access their digital content from their current location.</p>
<p>You have ways to bypass such restrictions, but be warned: Network administrators don’t want you to circumvent their blockades. Use the following tools at your own risk.</p>
<h3><b>Change your apparent location with a VPN</b></h3><p>When you connect to a virtual private network (<b><a href="http://go.pcworld.com/usevpn" target="_self">go.pcworld.com/usevpn</a></b>), your computer creates a secure, encrypted tunnel to that network over the Internet. All of your network traffic transmits over the VPN, which alters how other entities “see” you online: If you’re in the United Kingdom and you connect to a VPN in California, for example, websites will see you as connecting from California.</p>
<p>Connecting via a VPN adds some increased latency because you’re going through a third party. Note, too, that all your programs will use the VPN when you’re connected. Enable it only when necessary.</p>
<p>One easy-to-use VPN is TunnelBear (<b><a href="http://tunnelbear.com" target="_self">tunnelbear.com</a></b>), which does all the configuration and offers 500MB free every month. You’ll blast through that data cap quickly, however, if you stream videos or music.</p>
<p>If you want unlimited VPN access for free, try ProXPN (<b><a href="http://proxpn.com" target="_self">proxpn.com</a></b>). It offers no-cost VPN access without a traffic limit, but free users don’t enjoy the maximum speed. For unlimited, unthrottled access, you have to pay for one of the many VPN services available.</p>
<p>To connect to a VPN in Windows, press the &lt;Windows&gt; key, type VPN, and click Set up a virtual private network (VPN) connection. (In Windows 8, select the Settings filter after searching for VPN.) You can connect and disconnect from VPNs via the network icon in the system tray.</p>

<p>Changing your PC’s DNS server opens multiple windows but is fairly simple.</p>
</figcaption>
    
    
    
    </div><h3><b>Dodge region-blocking via DNS servers</b></h3><p>If you just want access to region-blocked (aka geo-blocked) websites such as Hulu, Netflix, the BBC’s iPlayer, and other streaming media sources, your best option is a DNS-based filter-dodging service.</p>
<p>After you change your settings to use the service’s DNS address, it will handle the dirty work in the background. You can then connect to more than one region-blocked website at the same time, and to each site you will always appear to be coming from an approved country. Best of all, you’ll enjoy full streaming-video speeds on those sites. Your PC connects to each site—only small parts of the traffic go through the DNS service’s proxy servers.</p>
<p class="pullQuote"><b>To access region-blocked sites, your best option is a filter-dodging service.</b></p>
<p>Services such as OpenDNS (<b><a href="http://opendns.com" target="_self">opendns.com</a></b>) and Google Public DNS (<b><a href="http://go.pcworld.com/publicdns" target="_self">go.pcworld.com/publicdns</a></b>), which are free for consumer use, can also help you dodge an ISP’s efforts to redirect your search traffic in order to push more ads. Note that these options reroute all of your Internet traffic, however.</p>
<p>Most DNS services that let you view streaming media sites from nonsupported countries charge access fees. UnoDNS (<b><a href="http://unotelly.com/unodns" target="_self">unotelly.com/unodns</a></b>) costs $5 a month and gives you access to geo-blocked sites such as Netflix. Unblock Us (<b><a href="http://unblock-us.com" target="_self">unblock-us.com</a></b>) is similar.</p>
<p>You’ll want to change the DNS address on your router, if possible, so that all your devices use the DNS service. If you prefer, though, you can change the DNS address for your PC alone: Go to Control Panel ▸ View network status and tasks ▸ [Your network connection’s name] ▸ Properties</p>
<p>Internet Protocol Version 4 ▸ Properties ▸ Use the following DNS server addresses. For help, try the free DNS Jumper (<b><a href="http://go.pcworld.com/dnsjumper" target="_self">go.pcworld.com/dnsjumper</a></b>).</p>
<h3><b>Disguise yourself with a proxy server</b></h3><p>Proxies aren’t as secure as a VPN, nor are they as handy as a DNS server. But you could use a Web-based proxy to bypass a workplace content filter without changing the settings on your PC. You could also set a browser to use a proxy server for accessing blocked sites—you could even have one browser that uses a proxy server and another that doesn’t.</p>

<p>You can use the proxies listed on Hide My Ass, but you may have to change settings often.</p>
</figcaption>
    
    
    
    </div><p>The aptly named Hide My Ass (<b><a href="http://hidemyass.com" target="_self">hidemyass.com</a></b>) is a popular Web-based proxy. Visit the site, plug in a Web address, and you’ll access it via the free proxy. This arrangement should get you past a basic content filter—unless the administrator is blocking the proxy itself. What’s the catch? The service embeds advertising in a frame at the top.</p>
<p>Hide My Ass also offers a list of free proxies that you can configure your browser to use. Each proxy may go down eventually, so you might need to change them often. Remember, too, that proxies and other man-in-the-middle services can see your traffic, so don’t do any banking or access other sensitive info unless the connection is encrypted.</p>
<p>Configuring a proxy in your browser requires just a few clicks.</p>
<p><b>Internet Explorer:</b> Open the gear menu, and then click Internet Options Connections LAN settings Use a proxy server.</p>
<p><b>Firefox:</b> Under the Firefox menu, click Options Advanced Network Connection Settings Manual proxy configuration.</p>
<p><b>Chrome:</b> In the menu, click Settings Show advanced settings Change proxy settings LAN Settings Use a proxy server.</p>
<p>Internet Explorer and Chrome use the same Windows-wide proxy configuration, whereas Firefox can use a Firefox-only proxy.</p>
