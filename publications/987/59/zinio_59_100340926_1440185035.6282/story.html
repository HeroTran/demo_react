    </div><h3><b>Adobe combats an exploit in the wild</b></h3><p>You don’t want an evildoer to take over your PC remotely, and neither does Adobe. Citing this threat, Adobe patched its Flash Player (<a href="http://go.pcworld.com/adobe1407" target="_self">go.pcworld.com/adobe1407</a>) to 12.0.0.7, and updated version 11 to 11.7.700.269 (Windows and Mac) and 11.2.202.341 (Linux). The fixes also involve updates to Adobe AIR for Android and the Adobe AIR SDK for Windows and Mac.</p>
<p>Adobe identifies each vulnerability by a Common Vulnerabilities and Exposure number: For instance, this particular update addresses CVE-2014-0498, describing a remote execution vulnerability, and CVE-2014-0499, which covers some unsecured code addresses.</p>
<p>But the third one is the kicker, and the reason why this is an update well worth installing: CVE-2014-0502 involves a bizarre situation in which the same memory is being freed twice, possibly leading to a buffer overflow. You may wonder what that means, but Adobe is “aware of reports that an exploit for CVE-2014-0502 exists in the wild, and recommends users update their product installations.”</p>

    </div><h3><b>Make Synology’s VPN private again</b></h3><p>If you read our report on routers and NAS boxes in last month’s issue, you know that many devices leave their data disturbingly easy to access. (See the story at <a href="http://go.pcworld.com/routerrisk" target="_self">go.pcworld.com/routerrisk</a> if you missed it.) One recent example comes courtesy of the OpenVPN module in Synology’s 4.3-3810 update to its DiskStation Manager operating system.</p>
<p>A hard-coded password within said module (<a href="http://go.pcworld.com/synologyflaw" target="_self">go.pcworld.com/synologyflaw</a>) makes the device very easy to invade. Fortunately, Synology has released version 5 5.0-4458 already; if you haven’t updated, do so now. Or update the VPN module in the package center. Or stick with the PPTP and L2TP/IPSec protocols.</p>
