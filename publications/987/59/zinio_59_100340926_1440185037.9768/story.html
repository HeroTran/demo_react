    </div><p><b>ON A MECHANICAL</b> keyboard, you don’t have to push a key until it bottoms out, which reduces the amount of work your fingers and wrists must do. If you use a keyboard strictly for productivity, a fully mechanical keyboard will boost your typing speed and accuracy. If you’re a gamer, you’ll benefit from quicker response times.</p>
<p>So don’t put up with the cheap membrane keyboard that came with your PC. Lots of great mechanical alternatives are available, and I’ve just laid hands on six of them. For this roundup, I tested each keyboard with everything from Titanfall to Microsoft Word. The reviews are arranged by rating, from highest to lowest.</p>

<p>WASD Keyboard’s WASD V2 87-Key Custom Mechanical Keyboard (<a href="http://go.pcworld.com/wasdv2" target="_self">go.pcworld.com/wasdv2</a>) is the ultimate tinkerer’s keyboard. At the company’s website you can use WASD’s online designer to choose which Cherry MX switches to use, whether to include O-rings (to dampen the audio level of the keyboard’s clacking keys), what colors to use for its keycaps, how to organize its key layout (if you prefer Dvorak to QWERTY, for instance), and which symbol to print on the &lt;Windows&gt; key.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can download WASD’s design file and create something completely customized—a Zelda-themed keyboard, say.</p>
<p>For my V2 I adopted a color scheme similar to the WASD default: a red &lt;Escape&gt; key and everything else in two-tone gray, with keycaps labeled in Futura font. The case itself is black. Even after months of heavy use, my keyboard shows few signs of wear.</p>
<p>The V2’s cable isn’t braided, but you can route it through five different channels on its bottom, so it emerges from the center, the top right, the top left, the middle right, or the middle left side.</p>
<p>DIP switches along the bottom of the keyboard allow you to add customizations that flashier keyboards provide dedicated buttons for. You can configure the &lt;Scroll Lock&gt; key to toggle the &lt;Windows&gt; key off and on, or disable the &lt;Windows&gt; key altogether. You can also remap the keys to Dvorak, Colemak, QWERTY, or Mac mode; flip the &lt;Caps Lock&gt; and &lt;Control&gt; key positions; and more.</p>
<p>True N-key rollover is supported only through the included PS/2 adapter. USB users are stuck with modified six-key rollover (you can press up to six keys simultaneously, and the keyboard will recognize additional key presses after that). I haven’t had any problems, but dedicated gamers who use a lot of keyboard shortcuts should confirm that their PC has an available PS/2 port (a legacy port that has been disappearing from modern motherboards in recent years).</p>
<p>The V2’s Home block also functions as a media-player controller: &lt;Play/Pause&gt;, &lt;Stop&gt;, and &lt;Volume Up&gt; operate on the &lt;Insert&gt;, &lt;Home&gt;, and &lt;Page Up&gt; keys, respectively; and &lt;Skip Forward&gt;, &lt;Skip Back&gt;, and &lt;Volume Down&gt; double up on the &lt;Delete&gt;, &lt;End&gt;, and &lt;Page Down&gt; keys, respectively. If you order a WASD board, be sure to have those behaviors engraved on the keys, or you’ll never remember that they exist.</p>
<p>The keyboard doesn’t deliver much in the way of custom behaviors, and the lack of backlighting is a minus, but overall the V2 is one of the best simple keyboards around. And no other manufacturer allows as much factory customization.</p>

<p>The Logitech G710 Plus Mechanical Gaming Keyboard (<a href="http://go.pcworld.com/g710plus" target="_self">go.pcworld.com/g710plus</a>) is a behemoth that comes loaded with features. White LEDs provide backlighting that is divided into two independently controlled zones. One button manages the brightness of the W-A-S-D and arrow keys, while the other button controls the remainder of the keyboard. You can set each zone to any of five brightness levels (one of which is ‘off’). At lower levels, the lighting for the &lt;Shift&gt;, &lt;Tab&gt;, and &lt;Enter&gt; keys is a bit uneven, but that’s a minor quibble.</p>
<p>Six macro keys arranged in a column of border the G710 Plus’s left side. You can store three macros in each of these macro keys, and you can switch between them on the fly by pressing a companion key, much as you would change stations on your car radio. Unfortunately, the companion key isn’t backlit.</p>
<p>Logitech didn’t build any onboard memory into the G710 Plus, so you’ll have to install Logitech’s software on the host PC before you can program the macros.</p>
<p>The G710 Plus has a row of dedicated media-player control keys—&lt;Play&gt;, &lt;Stop&gt;, &lt;Skip Forward&gt;, and &lt;Skip Back&gt;—on its top right size, along with a broad roller for volume control and a mute button above the numeric keypad. A Game Mode button at the center-top of the keyboard disables the &lt;Windows&gt; key, so you’ll never get dumped back to the desktop in the middle of a game.</p>
<p>Logitech uses Cherry MX Brown keyswitches, so it’s relatively quiet for a mechanical keyboard. Despite its large size, though, the G710 Plus’s keys are so close together that I committed atypical typing errors even after prolonged use.</p>
<p>The G710 Plus’s cord attaches to the keyboard with a stiff rubber collar that doesn’t bend easily. It also consumes two of your computer’s USB ports. You get one of them back in the form of a USB pass-through on the board itself; but it’s located behind the keyboard next to the cord, so if you plug a headset into it, the wire will drape awkwardly across the keys.</p>
<p>Overall, however, the G710 Plus is one of the most restrained and attractive macro-key–enabled gaming keyboards I’ve tested.</p>

<p>The Razer BlackWidow Ultimate 2014 (<a href="http://go.pcworld.com/razerbwus" target="_self">go.pcworld.com/razerbwus</a>) uses Razer’s own keyswitches, rather than some form of Cherry MX switches. The Razer Green switches that the BlackWidow Ultimate relies on require the same actuation force—a fairly heavy 50cN (centinewtons)—as Cherry MX Blues do, and they exhibit the same clicky tactile feedback. The Razer Greens, however, have a much higher actuation point than the Cherry MX Blues. It’s very close to the keycap’s resting point, and its resistance fades rapidly past the actuation point.</p>
<p>For gaming—which is clearly the BlackWidow Ultimate’s primary focus—the high actuation point is a great feature. It allows you to double-or triple-tap keys quickly, much as you can with Cherry Blacks. But instead of that switch’s linear resistance, you get the clicky, tactile feedback you’d expect with Cherry Blues. For touch typing, however, the high set is too hair-trigger for the keyboard’s own good.</p>

    </div><p>The BlackWidow Ultimate features Razer’s standard black-and-neon-green color scheme. Keys are individually backlit, with settings that range from off to excessively bright.</p>
<p>Five macro keys arranged in a column occupy the left side of the board. You can program these keys by using Razer’s Synapse software. Because Razer stores the settings in a personal profile in the cloud instead of in on-board memory, you must register an email address with Razer and install Razer’s Synapse software on every computer that you attach to the keyboard.</p>
<p>The top row of function keys have secondary functions, which you activate by holding down a second key. You get the usual media-player control keys, a &lt;Game Mode&gt; key, a key for on-the-fly macro recording, one for adjusting backlight brightness, and one for sleep mode. The keycap for activating these secondary functions is the only key that isn’t backlit, making it relatively easy to find.</p>
<p>One oddity: Rather than lighting up circular LEDs to inform you that something like Game Mode or Caps Lock is active, the BlackWidow Ultimate lights up icons. Caps Lock, for instance, gets a “C”, while Game Mode gets a “G” with a crosshair. Unfortunately, housing these icons beneath the plastic top renders them blurry and difficult to see when viewed from behind the keyboard.</p>
<p>The keyboard’s cable sheath is braided and ends in a hard-rubber joint where it connects to the keyboard. At the other end are two USB plugs and 1/8-inch cables for a headphone and mic. The keyboard includes audio and mic jacks on its top-right side, plus one USB port.</p>
<p>If you’re a big-time game player, the Razer BlackWidow Ultimate might be your ideal keyboard. But I recommend using a different keyboard for evryday typing.</p>

<p>According to Feenix, the monolith in 2001: A Space Odyssey inspired the design of the slate-gray Autore (<a href="http://go.pcworld.com/autore" target="_self">go.pcworld.com/autore</a>). This exceedingly basic keyboard doesn’t have media-player control keys, backlighting, or macro keys. It’s just a pure, unadulterated keyboard.</p>
<p>The Autore does sport Cherry MX Brown switches, which provide a tactile bump with less click and actuation force than Cherry Blues deliver. It’s fairly heavy, too, at more than 2.5 pounds, and its braided cable (somewhat annoyingly) emerges from the top-right side instead of close to the desk.</p>
<p>Ultimately, however, this keyboard relies on its looks, starting with its understated black-on-dark-gray keys. So you have to ask yourself, “How much do I like really lightweight, sans serif typefaces? How badly do I want to own a keyboard that spells out ‘win’ instead of stamping Microsoft’s logo on the Windows key?”</p>
<p>Considerations of style aside, the Autore has little to recommend it over competitors that cost less and offer more features. Whether you’re looking for a gaming keyboard or a restrained office keyboard, better options are available at much lower prices.</p>

<p>The SteelSeries 6Gv2 (<a href="http://go.pcworld.com/6gv2" target="_self">go.pcworld.com/6gv2</a>) is built for people who may sometimes treat their keyboard more harshly than they ought to. The 6Gv2 is solid, durable and heavy; and it uses Cherry MX Black keyswitches, which require the greatest amount of actuation force of any model in the entire Cherry MX product line.</p>
<p>Beyond that, though, this no-frills keyboard has few selling points. It’s not backlit. It doesn’t have macro keys. It doesn’t even have flip-out feet for adjusting its angle. Various media-player control keys share space on the first six function keys, but they represent the only other significant bonus feature you’ll find here.</p>

<p>On the performance front, the 6Gv2’s keys feel very cramped, a practical problem that the keyboard’s nonstandard key layout exacerbates. The | key sits next to the M key, and the &lt;Enter&gt; key is enormous. Such a layout isn’t unheard of, but it constitutes an unnecessary complication. Even after several hours of use, I found myself constantly making typos.</p>
<p>The weakest component of this durable keyboard is its cheap rubber cable, which has a stiff joint where it joins the keyboard. I doubt that the cord will stand up to much abuse. And for all this keyboard’s bulk, you can readily find heavier and more durable models out there.</p>
<p>The 6Gv2 isn’t aesthetically pleasing, and it doesn’t have enough frills to justify its $109 price tag.</p>

<p>The Ozone Strike Pro (<a href="http://go.pcworld.com/strikepro" target="_self">go.pcworld.com/strikepro</a>) is surprisingly understated for a gaming keyboard. Turn off its backlight and you could use it at work. With the backlight on, however, the W-A-S-D block and the arrow keys light up blood-red. The backlight has six settings: off, three levels of brightness, one level that slowly pulses as though the keyboard were breathing, and one level that illuminates only the red sections.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the red backlights don’t dim in concert with the white lights. When you use the keyboard in the dark, the W-A-S-D and arrow keys remain garishly illuminated. And the Strike Pro logo on the front of the spacebar is blindingly bright when backlit.</p>
<p>The keyboard itself is beautifully designed, as long as it’s lying flat on the work surface. Its fixed narrow wrist rest delivers more support than you might expect. During long gaming sessions, however, I found that the material it’s composed of caused the heels of my hands to sweat profusely. And don’t deploy its retractable feet: The Strike Pro is a thick keyboard, and tilting it up by flipping its feet out caused my wrists to start aching almost immediately.</p>

<p>Three channels on the bottom of the keyboard allow you to route its thick, braided cable out of the top center or to the left or right side. The cable ends with three jacks: a USB jack plus 1/8-inch mic and headphone jacks to feed its audio hub.</p>
<p>The keyboard we tested was outfitted with Cherry Red keyswitches, but you can order yours with Cherry Blacks, Browns, or Blues instead, if you prefer. You can adjust the keyboard’s response time and polling rate directly from the keyboard, using the &lt;Ozone&gt; key that replaces the right &lt;Windows&gt; key. You also get also a suite of media-player control keys, a backlight adjuster, and a &lt;Game Mode&gt; key that disables the remaining &lt;Windows&gt; key and enables macros.</p>
<p>The Strke Pro’s six macro keys share keycaps with the &lt;Insert&gt;, &lt;Home&gt;, &lt;Page Up&gt;, &lt;Delete&gt;, &lt;End&gt;, and &lt;Page Down&gt; key functions. But Ozone’s macro-creation software is terrible. When you apply your changes and enable a new configuration, the PC hangs for upward of 10 seconds. On the plus side, the software stores the macros you create with it in the keyboard’s onboard memory, so you won’t need to deal with the software very often.</p>
<p>The Ozone Strike Pro is a solid, if unremarkable, keyboard. It’s not a bad choice by any means, but it doesn’t do anything that stands out.</p>
