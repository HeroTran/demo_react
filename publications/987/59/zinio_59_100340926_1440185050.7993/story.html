    </div><p><b>IF YOU WANT</b> to work incognito at the coffee shop or blend discreetly into the boardroom, Acer’s squarish, matte-black TravelMate Pro (<b><a href="http://go.pcworld.com/acertravelmate" target="_self">go.pcworld.com/acertravelmate</a></b>) is the laptop to use. It doesn’t flip, fold, detach, or do any other fancy tricks. But the TravelMate Pro is light, rugged, secure, and fast.</p>
<p>The TMP645-MG-9419 version of the TravelMate Pro that Acer sent us came outfitted with an Intel Core i7-4500u processor, 8GB of DDR3/1600 memory, a discrete AMD Radeon HD 8750M graphics processor, and a 256GB Toshiba solid-state drive.</p>

<p>The TravelMate’s battery life won’t blow your mind, but it’s very good considering that the battery is powering a discrete GPU.</p>

    </div><p>The laptop’s quick and smooth performance earned the Acer a score of 68 in our Notebook WorldBench 9 test suite. (Note that PCWorld’s WorldBench scale has changed, and the new reference point is a much faster laptop than was used to produce WorldBench 8 and WorldBench 8.1 scores.)</p>

<p>We expect to see VGA on a business laptop, but this HDMI port surprised us.</p>
</figcaption>
    
    
    
    </div><p>And thanks to its discrete GPU, the TravelMate Pro even managed to deliver playable frame rates with games such as BioShock Infinite and Grid 2 (albeit at a resolution of 1024 by 768 pixels). Still, that’s something no laptop with integrated graphics can accomplish. Video playing at the display’s native resolution of 1920 by 1080 pixels was butter-smooth, but movie soundtracks sounded blah.</p>
<p>If the TravelMate’s appearance isn’t particularly compelling, its carbon-fiber chassis and all-metal hinges are. This laptop is very sturdy, though the bezel surrounding the 14-inch, IPS display flexes quite a bit.</p>
<p>There’s at least one design oddity that will irk an IT department: The screws securing the access plate covering the hard drive and memory slots are of two different gauges. Not expecting this, I inadvertently stripped one of the smaller screws. Who wants to change screwdrivers twice every time they open an access panel? Certainly not anyone charged with managing a fleet of notebooks.</p>

    </div><p>A gigabit ethernet port stands out among ports and connectivity options, which are mostly what you’d expect to find on a notebook in this class: three USB 3.0 ports, VGA and HDMI video outputs, and separate mic and headphone jacks. Wireless functions include Bluetooth 4, but the Wi-Fi adapter tops out at 802.11n—we’d be happier with 802.11ac. PCWorld favors DisplayPort connectors over HDMI, but you’ll need to buy Acer’s $150 ProDock to get that. A cheap 0.9-megapixel webcam is mounted in the display’s bezel, with a single integrated mic.</p>
<p>The TravelMate Pro’s input ergonomics are very sound. The touchpad is silky, and the backlit, island-style keyboard has full-size keys with decent tactile feedback. The notebook is also outfitted with a biometric fingerprint reader and a docking port on its underbelly.</p>

<p>Acer promises that TravelMate Pro models will remain essentially the same for 12 to 18 months from introduction, and that replacement parts will be available for at least three years.</p>
<p>The unit comes with a two-year mail-in/carry-in warranty, which can be extended one additional year. On-site and other service options are also available at extra cost. This information is a bit difficult to find, as Acer hides it from anyone whose laptop is not registered.</p>
<p>At $1300, this TravelMate Pro is quite a nice piece of hardware, and it’s significantly less expensive than much of its business-oriented competition. But the lack of a five-year warranty, the shortish coverage, and niggling details like different-gauge screws will irk the corporate element of its intended audience. The favorable price-to-performance ratio makes it a go for independent business users, but for corporate fleets? Probably not.</p>
<h3><b>Acer TravelMate Pro (Model P645-MG-9419)</b></h3><p><b>PROS:</b></p>
<p>• Very good performance</p>
<p>• Long battery life</p>
<p>• Docking station option</p>
<p><b>CONS:</b></p>
<p>• Aesthetically dull</p>
<p>• Bottom access plate uses two gauges of screws</p>
<p>• Optional warranties limited to just three years</p>
<p><b>BOTTOM LINE:</b></p>
<p>For solo business users, this laptop offers a nice blend of modern features and solid performance. It’s not stylish, but its input ergonomics are very good.</p>
