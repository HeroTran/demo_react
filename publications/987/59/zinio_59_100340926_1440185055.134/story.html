    </div><p><b>WINDOWS TABLETS ARE</b> disappointingly uniform: Nearly all use the same processor, have the same resolution, and contain the same amount of memory and storage. So I was happy to see the Toshiba Encore 8 (<b><a href="http://go.pcworld.com/toshibaencore8" target="_self">go.pcworld.com/toshibaencore8</a></b>), which stands out thanks to its Micro HDMI port and 8-megapixel rear camera. This 8-inch tablet is also chunkier than its competition, however.</p>
<p>The Encore 8 runs on an Intel Bay Trail Atom Z3740 processor, and it carries 2GB of low-power DDR3/1067 memory. The model I reviewed shipped with 64GB of solid-state storage, a feature that adds $50 to the price. (Toshiba’s $300 base Encore 8 has 32GB of storage.)</p>

<p>The Encore 8’s battery should last through a full day if you don’t push it too hard. Competing tablets are better choices if you need battery longevity.</p>

    </div><p>Our benchmark results illustrate the sameness of Bay Trail tablets: In the performance tests we ran, the Encore 8 fell in between the Asus Transformer Book T100, which uses the same processor, and the Dell Venue 11 Pro (see page 69), which has the slightly faster Atom Z3770.</p>
<p>The Encore 8 handled daily tasks smoothly. My only complaint is that its touchscreen was not especially responsive, sometimes requiring multiple taps to register a click.</p>
<p>On the IPS display, which delivers a native resolution of 1280 by 800 pixels, text and images are clear from a reading distance. The panel offers excellent viewing angles. Streaming video plays clearly and smoothly, and the dual speakers grew loud enough to wake my toddler, who was napping in another room (oops). Audio is thin at the highest volumes, but it doesn’t distort.</p>

<p>We snapped this photo with the Encore 8’s excellent 8-megapixel rear camera.</p>

    </div><p>The Encore 8’s Micro HDMI port is a major plus, as many other small Windows tablets rely on wireless video streaming technology to send the video out to an external display or TV. The port is located on the top (when the tablet is in portrait orientation), along with the Micro-USB port, which supports both charging and USB data connections. A MicroSD card slot positioned on the left side allows you to add storage.</p>
<p>Most 8-inch tablets have only a 5-megapixel camera. The 8-megapixel rear camera in the Encore 8 takes bright and vivid pictures loaded with detail. It has no accompanying flash, however, so its low-light performance is weaker. The front-facing 2-megapixel camera is fine for videoconferencing.</p>
<p>Regrettably, the Encore 8 is thicker and heavier than other 8-inch Windows tablets we’ve tested previously, and some of Toshiba’s design choices—such as the silver trim and the cheap-feeling, textured plastic back—make it seem even bulkier. For a tablet that’s designed to be held in one hand, it’s too much. During my testing, the Encore 8 spent most of its time propped up on a stand or lying flat on a table.</p>
<p>Some of the extra mass might be attributable to the tablet’s larger storage capacity, but it certainly is not attributable to a heftier battery: In our tests the Encore 8 petered out after only 6 hours, 59 minutes.</p>
<p>A tablet that provides 64GB of storage is likely to satisfy you. If you don’t need the Encore 8’s Micro HDMI port, however, take a look at the Dell Venue 8 Pro or the Lenovo Miix 2 8, which deliver about the same performance in a slimmer, lighter package.</p>
