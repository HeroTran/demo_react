    </div><p><b>WITH ITS TWO</b> optional accessories, the 10.8-inch Dell Venue 11 Pro tablet (<b><a href="http://go.pcworld.com/venue11pro" target="_self">go.pcworld.com/venue11pro</a></b>) can transform into a small laptop or a diminutive all-in-one PC. Its two-day battery life with the optional keyboard dock is amazing. But I wish it had more memory and storage.</p>
<p>Running on an Intel Atom Z3770 processor (Bay Trail class), it posted WorldBench 9 test scores that were only modestly higher than those of Asus’s Z3740-powered Transformer Book T100. Even so, with the Venue 11 Pro I felt like I wasn’t waiting as long for things to happen.</p>
<p>I just had to see if it could run The Sims 3, my guilty pleasure. Most Atom tablets launch the game, but their frame rates are frustratingly slow, and background calculations bog down the gameplay even more. To my delight, the game ran smoothly on this Dell tablet at medium settings.</p>
<p>In contrast to most Atom-based tablets, the Venue 11 Pro boasts a full 1080p panel. Netflix movies look great on this display, and Windows 8’s modern interface and apps scale nicely. The text in Chrome seems a little fuzzy, though.</p>

<p>Don’t be alarmed by the Venue 11 Pro’s seemingly low WorldBench score. We use the same high-end laptop as a reference point for both laptops and tablets.</p>

    </div><p>The entry-level Venue 11 Pro has just 2GB of DDR3/1066 memory and 64GB of storage. You have options for adding extra storage—you can insert a MicroSD card, keep data in the cloud, or use an accessory such as SanDisk’s Ultra Dual USB Drive. Two gigs of RAM, on the other hand, is a true limitation: Each time I ended a Sims 3 session, a notice declared that I was running out of memory.</p>
<p>Still, 11 inches is a lot of tablet. You need both hands to hold the Venue 11 Pro in its tablet mode, but the screen’s readability fully justifies the 1.57-pound weight, especially when you’re looking at it on a desktop or in your lap.</p>

    </div><p>The touchscreen is responsive for navigation, but it registered double taps with annoying frequency when I used its on-screen keyboard. The $160 keyboard dock is an essential accessory for writing longer messages and documents. The keyboard has its own battery, which drains first. I watched several hours of videos, played a few hours of games, and surfed for a couple more, draining only the keyboard’s battery. I worked the whole next day off the tablet’s battery without plugging it in overnight. The keyboard is comfortable, which makes the combination a pretty good laptop. The small touchpad is adequate.</p>
<p>The pair is heavier than many 13-inch laptops, however: The keyboard weighs 28 ounces, which puts the total weight at 3.31 pounds (without the power adapter). Another problem: The keyboard offers little play to tilt the tablet back.</p>
<p>In Dell’s $140 Tablet Dock accessory, the tablet sits at a fixed angle, and that worked well enough for me. This dock supplies three USB 3.0 ports, HDMI, DisplayPort, 10/100 ethernet, and analog audio and video connectors. The dock charges the tablet, freeing up the tablet’s power adapter to charge the keyboard. Alternatively, you can charge both the keyboard and the tablet while the two are paired, but that takes a long time.</p>
<p>Dell’s Venue 11 Pro ups the ante for hybrid devices thanks to its versatile accessories. I found its three modes to be more than adequate for my entertainment and routine-computing needs.</p>

    </div><h3><b>Dell Venue 11 Pro</b></h3><p><b>PROS:</b></p>
<p>• 1080p display</p>
<p>• Strong CPU, for a tablet</p>
<p>• Great optional accessories</p>
<p><b>CONS:</b></p>
<p>• A little thick and heavy</p>
<p>• Optional keyboard dock is nearly essential for productivity</p>
<p>• 2GB of memory can be limiting</p>
<p><b>BOTTOM LINE:</b></p>
<p>This tablet shines when you add its mobile-keyboard and desktop docks. The Atom processor is sufficiently powerful—and power-efficient.</p>
