    </div><p><b>THE NEW LENOVO</b> ThinkPad X1 Carbon (<b><a href="http://go.pcworld.com/lenovox1" target="_self">go.pcworld.com/lenovox1</a></b>) is thinner and lighter than the original (<b><a href="http://go.pworld.com/x1carbon" target="_self">go.pworld.com/x1carbon</a></b>), which was introduced in 2012 and updated with a touchscreen (<b><a href="http://go.pcworld.com/x1touch" target="_self">go.pcworld.com/x1touch</a></b>) in early 2013. Yet it has a higher-resolution display, more I/O ports, an improved docking-station option, and an entirely new “adaptive function key” row. Drawbacks include a somewhat altered keyboard layout and half-baked voice-and gesture-control features.</p>
<p>The evaluation unit that we tested came configured with an Intel Core i5-4300U processor, 4GB of low-power DDR3/1600 memory, and a rather skimpy 180GB SSD. Its delightful 14-inch IPS touchscreen boasts a resolution of 2560 by 1440 pixels and a pixel density of 210 pixels per inch, which is just shy of the 15-inch Apple MacBook Pro with Retina display’s 2560-by-1800-pixel resolution and 220-ppi pixel density.</p>
<p>The X1 Carbon’s touch-responsive screen is very bright and delivers excellent contrast in all lighting situations. Its hinges permit 180 degrees of rotation. Lenovo also offers this ThinkPad in less-expensive configurations with nontouch and lower-resolution screens.</p>
<p>The 2014 X1 Carbon is thinner, lighter, and more powerful than previous models, and has a higher-resolution touchscreen display.</p>

<h3><b>Robust, but lightweight</b></h3><p>The upper half of the ThinkPad X1 Carbon is fabricated from carbon fiber, while the lower half of the chassis is composed of a magnesium alloy. The new touchscreen configuration is 0.72 inch thick and weighs 3.15 pounds. The chassis has a charcoal-gray nonslip finish.</p>
<p>The 2014 model lacks an SD Card slot, but it has two USB 3.0 ports, a mini DisplayPort, a full-size HDMI, and a proprietary gigabit ethernet port (a dongle adapter is provided). The new X1 Carbon also supports 802.11ac Wi-Fi by way of Intel’s Dual Band Wireless-AC 7260 adapter. You’ll find a fingerprint reader on the margin of the right side of the deck, next to the right arrow key.</p>
<p>A proprietary port links the notebook to Lenovo’s new OneLink docking station, so you don’t have to surrender a USB port when you’re deskbound. The OneLink Dock Pro ($180) uses a single cable for power, data, and uncompressed video over DisplayPort and DVI. It has four USB 3.0 ports (one with always-on charging), two USB 2.0 ports, gigabit ethernet, and a stereo mic/headphone jack.</p>

    </div><h3><b>Mighty morphin’ function row</b></h3><p>Replacing the usual row of keys at the top of the typical keyboard is an “adaptive function row,” whose options (and icons) change depending on the application you’re using—word processor, Web browser, or whatever. You can manually switch by touching the &lt;Fn&gt; key at the far left.</p>
<p>The laptop offers four sets of touch-sensitive icons: Home (the default set); Web Browser (which supports Internet Explorer, Chrome, Firefox, and Safari); Web Conference (for Skype, Google Talk, or WebEx sessions); and Function (for work with Microsoft Office apps).</p>
<p>The X1 Carbon’s keyboard offers excellent tactile feedback. I also like the new (and slightly larger) clickpad, with right, left, and center mouse buttons integrated into the pad.</p>

    </div><h3><b>Voice and gesture controls</b></h3><p>The ThinkPad X1 Carbon’s voice-recognition capabilities are powered by Nuance’s Dragon Assistant (<b><a href="http://go.pcworld.com/dragonassist" target="_self">go.pcworld.com/dragonassist</a></b>)—and they’re exceptionally good. But unless you work at home or in an enclosed office, you probably won’t use them. And be aware that the ability to recognize your utterances isn’t the same as the ability to do something useful with them.</p>
<p>You can set Dragon Assistant to run in the background and activate it by saying “Hello Dragon,” or you can leave it off and activate it from the adaptive function row (in three of the row’s four configurations). It will return to sleep on its own, or you can say “Go to sleep” to stop it from listening. Unfortunately, most people will find that they can’t do anything faster by voice than with a mouse and keyboard.</p>
<p>The X1 Carbon’s gesture controls use your camera to recognize hand gestures. It works with some programs and a few Metro games. Swiping your hand in front of the camera (palm facing out) from right to left is supposed to trigger the next slide in a presentation or slideshow, or move you to the next page in a document. Swiping from left to right causes the previous slide or page to display.</p>

<p>The 2014 Lenovo X1 Carbon is slightly faster than the HP EliteBook Folio 1040 G1.</p>

    </div><h3><b>Where’s the CapsLock?</b></h3><p>Various legacy keys are relegated to key combinations. To toggle Scroll Lock you must press &lt;Fn&gt;-K; to put the computer to sleep, you have to press &lt;Fn&gt;-4; and for Break, Pause, SysRq, and Insert modes, you must use similar key combinations.</p>
<p>On the original X1 Carbon, you could turn on the keyboard backlight by holding down &lt;Fn&gt; and tapping the spacebar. The new X1 Carbon sets aside a dedicated icon for that function on the adaptive function key row, but that icon appears on only one of the four displayed rows. Lenovo also replaced the &lt;CapsLock&gt; key, with half-size &lt;Home&gt; and &lt;End&gt; keys—opposite where they are on most keyboards.</p>
<p>You can toggle CapsLock on and off by double-tapping the &lt;Shift&gt; key. Lenovo wisely added an LED to that key to indicate its status (lit when CapsLock is engaged, dark when it’s not). The previous X1 Carbon’s oversize &lt;Backspace&gt; key has been reduced by about a third, and the &lt;Delete&gt; key is to its right.</p>
<h3><b>Performance and battery life</b></h3><p>The 2014 X1 Carbon earned a Notebook WorldBench 9 score of 64, putting it almost exactly midway between the Intel Core i5-4200U–powered HP EliteBook Folio 1040 G1 (<b><a href="http://go.pcworld.com/folio1040g1" target="_self">go.pcworld.com/folio1040g1</a></b>), which put together a mark of 61, and the Intel Core i7-4500U–based Acer TravelMate Pro (<b><a href="http://go.pcworld.com/travelmatepro" target="_self">go.pcworld.com/travelmatepro</a></b>), which came in at 68. All three chips use Intel HD Graphics 4400 integrated graphics, but Lenovo’s is the only one that supports Intel’s enterprise-oriented Stable Image Platform, vPro, and Trusted Execution Technology.</p>
<p>The X1 Carbon’s battery life of 3 hours, 59 minutes in our battery run-down test is disappointing in comparison to the marks for the HP (4 hours, 55 minutes) and the Acer (5 hours, 55 minutes). To its credit, the battery does recharge rapidly.</p>
<h3><b>Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon</b></h3><p><b>PROS:</b></p>
<p>• Robust yet lightweight construction</p>
<p>• 2560-by-1440-pixel touchscreen</p>
<p>• HDMI and DisplayPort; hardwired ethernet; 802.11ac Wi-Fi</p>
<p>• Adaptive function row</p>
<p><b>CONS:</b></p>
<p>• Short battery life</p>
<p>• Unconventional keyboard layout</p>
<p>• Overhyped speech-and gesture-recognition features</p>
<p><b>BOTTOM LINE:</b></p>
<p>Almost everything about the new X1 Carbon is better than the original. But Lenovo’s engineers should have left the keyboard beneath the adaptive function row alone, and jettisoned the laptop’s speech and gesture recognition.</p>
