    </div><p><b>THE HP Z Display Z27i (<a href="http://go.pcworld.com/zdisplayz27i" target="_self">go.pcworld.com/zdisplayz27i</a>)</b> is a 27-inch professional desktop monitor with 2560 by 1440 native resolution. It offers a high-quality IPS screen, LED backlighting, and an antiglare feature that many people find desirable.</p>
<p>The Z Display Z27i also offers far greater ergonomic flexibility than most monitors. You can adjust its height and tilt, and rotate it into portrait orientation. Other welcome features include four downstream USB 3.0 ports and plenty of connection options such as VGA, DVI-D, and HDMI. Although the Z Display Z27i supports DisplayPort, it doesn’t supply the DisplayPort-out connection that the spec’s multistreaming feature requires in order to daisy-chain monitors.</p>

<p>A generous 178-degree range of acceptable viewing angles ensures that people gathered around your screen will see the same colors that you do. The display uses an IPS Gen 2 panel, which blocks less light than earlier IPS panels, helping to reduce power consumption.</p>
<p>In my tests the Z Display Z27i delivered natural-looking skin tones, neutral grays, and white points that seemed a little warmer than those on my reference display (an Apple HD Cinema). I used the Z Display Z27i as my primary desktop monitor for a couple of weeks and found text to be very legible, even at small point sizes. I liked the monitor’s height adjustment options and its antiglare screen. I didn’t detect any problems with color uniformity across the screen.</p>
<h3><b>HP Z Display Z27i</b></h3><p><b>PROS:</b></p>
<p>• Antiglare screen</p>
<p>• Flexible stand</p>
<p><b>CONS:</b></p>
<p>• Doesn’t support DisplayPort multistreaming</p>
<p><b>BOTTOM LINE:</b></p>
<p>Anyone looking for a high-quality, IPS screen will be impressed by the 27-inch HP Z Display Z27i’s extrawide viewing angles, accurate color, tons of input options, ergonomic flexibility, and antiglare screen.</p>
