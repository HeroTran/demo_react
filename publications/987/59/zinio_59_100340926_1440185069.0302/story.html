    </div><p><b>WHEN APPLE ANNOUNCED</b> that iWork would be bundled with new iOS devices and Macs, it seemed to slam the door on Microsoft’s Office ambitions for the iPad. How could Microsoft compete with free apps? The answer: Outdo iWork in form and function.</p>
<p>Office for iPad (<b><a href="http://go.pcworld.com/officeipad" target="_self">go.pcworld.com/officeipad</a></b>) consists of Word, Excel, and PowerPoint. (OneNote for the iPad was released in 2011.) Users can download each app, for free, from iTunes on an iPad running iOS 7.0 or above. And each app is free for viewing documents created elsewhere.</p>
<p>To create or edit documents, however, you must subscribe to Office 365, either the Home Premium tier ($10 per month), the upcoming Personal option ($7 per month), or one of several business plans. Each Office 365 subscription includes at least one tablet subscription, which covers Office for iPad. It also includes Microsoft’s OneDrive cloud storage service. You can connect both your personal OneDrive and your OneDrive for Business accounts, as well as connect to SharePoint.</p>
<p>Each app allows you to do things with a document, rather than just hunt and peck at it as in Office Mobile on a smartphone. Office for iPad represents the distilled Office, poured into an iOS glass. Frankly, I prefer it to Office 2013, as Microsoft organizes common functions intuitively by way of an icon-laden ribbon. Word, for example, preserves the footnote capability but eliminates the Mailings and References headings.</p>
<p>Working with text is easy: Tapping once on a word moves the cursor to that location; tapping twice creates slider bars to highlight a block. Pressing and releasing prompts selection or insertion options. Holding your finger down summons the zoom icon.</p>
<p>For most of my testing, I paired the preloaded iPad Air that Microsoft sent us with a Parle Innovation Pi Dock-It Pro keyboard case. But touch is intuitive for moving images and resizing PowerPoint slide headings, especially as text reflows around resized art. On occasion I had to tap almost randomly to select a field before I could edit its text; but eventually I accomplished what I set out to do.</p>
<p>Sometimes Microsoft gets too cute. Take find-and-replace: To find a word, you need to tap the search icon at the top right. Then you tap the settings gear to the far left, and only then do you get the replace function.</p>
<p>Office for iPad retains some of Office’s biggest attractions, including the ability to coauthor documents and to track changes. The track-changes function seems especially well implemented. Printing is a notable omission, but Microsoft executives have implied that the company will add it soon.</p>
<p>From a features perspective, the Office for iPad apps are just a few steps up from Office Online (formerly Office Web Apps). In Word Online, for example, you can add a shape or a footnote to selected text. The iPad version of Word omits that function, but everything else remains the same between the two. Like Word Online, Word for iPad has a spelling checker but no grammar checker or thesaurus. Some sophisticated section-formatting options are unavailable too.</p>
<p>On the other hand, you will find some lovely little touches. For example, Excel for iPad has a custom keypad to facilitate data entry and speed up formula entry. The formulas (not functions, as Excel Online calls them) are organized by category, similar to how Excel 2013 organizes them. The templates (16 in Excel for iPad versus 9 for Excel Online) are exceedingly useful, as are the defaults for charts and graphs.</p>
<p>I haven’t spent enough time comparing Office for iPad against iWork, but you’ll probably prefer Word over Pages, and maybe give a slight edge to Excel. I’ve always been impressed with Keynote, however, and I think most iPad users will stick with it. Regardless, kudos to the Office for iPad team: They’ve made “free” apps that rival anything Apple has created.</p>

<h3><b>Microsoft Office for iPad</b></h3><p><b>PROS:</b></p>
<p>• Elegantly meshes with the iOS aesthetic</p>
<p>• Preserves productivity features</p>
<p>• Integrates with OneDrive accounts</p>
<p><b>CONS:</b></p>
<p>• Creating and editing functions require a subscription</p>
<p>• Lacks the complete feature set of Office 2013</p>
<p><b>BOTTOM LINE:</b></p>
<p>Microsoft distills Office to its most useful essentials while presenting everything within the clean and familiar iOS look and feel.</p>
<p>Free app; Office 365 subscription (prices vary) required for document creation and editing</p>
