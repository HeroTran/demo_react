    </div><p><b>AMAZON¡¦S NEW SETÆªTOP</b> box, the Fire TV (<b><a href="http://go.pcworld.com/firetv" target="_self">go.pcworld.com/firetv</a></b>), is the company¡¦s way of planting a flag in your living room. Media streaming is a crowded market¡Xyou have the Apple TV and Roku competing against the Chromecast and Plair, not to mention game consoles, networked DVRs, and smart TVs. But Amazon has packed the Fire TV with enough horsepower and features to put it in the lead.</p>
<p>The Fire TV doesn’t come with an HDMI cable, but once you grab one of those, you hook the box to your TV, plug it into AC power, and follow the on-screen prompts. It connected to my Wi-Fi network without a hitch; it also has an ethernet port. Its optical-audio port is a nice bonus that lets you route the audio through a non-HDMI receiver or wireless surround headphones that accept optical input.</p>

<p>Because the Fire TV’s remote pairs via Bluetooth, you don’t have to point it at your TV.</p>
</figcaption>
    
    
    
    </div><p>The box arrives preloaded with your Amazon account. All of the digital content I’ve bought on Amazon, along with my Watchlist, was waiting for me on the Home screen. Then it was just a matter of adding apps such as Crackle, Hulu Plus, Netflix, Vevo, and YouTube, and logging in to those accounts.</p>
<p>Inside, the Fire TV boasts a quad-core processor and 2GB of memory. (The Apple TV, Roku 3, and Chromecast each include only 512MB.) Just ripping through the menus and popping in and out of videos with virtually no loading time is impressive. The Fire TV plays videos over Wi-Fi much faster than my Apple TV does over a wired connection, and they’re in HD from the start. If you choose an item from your Amazon Watchlist, or something recommended for you on the Home screen, it loads even faster. Leaving a movie to return to the main screen or to launch a voice search is instantaneous, and so is resuming a video you’ve recently begun.</p>

<h3><b>State your preference</b></h3><p>The Fire TV’s remote is quite the performer. It pairs to the Fire TV via Bluetooth, so you don’t need line of sight to the box. Its best feature is voice search. Press and hold the search button, and at the prompt speak into the built-in microphone, saying a movie or TV show title, the name of an actor or director, or even a genre. Once you choose a video, the first page of results is always Amazon’s offerings (rent and buy, as well as “watch now” if it’s on Prime); you have to click to a separate screen for “more ways to watch,” which includes Hulu Plus results if applicable. If your search turns up music videos on Vevo, those appear in a separate tab.</p>

<p>Although voice search is convenient, it’s limited to Amazon, Hulu Plus, and Vevo. If you’re looking for something that isn’t on Amazon, you won’t find it with voice search. I couldn’t find Hulu originals such as Behind the Mask, and when I searched for House of Cards, it said I could buy the first season on Amazon, but it didn’t tell me I could watch both seasons free on Netflix. Also, while voice search’s accuracy is generally very good, it stumbled at times—no matter how I pronounced “Steve Buscemi,” it never understood me.</p>
<p>Amazon is working with game developers and publishers to bring games to the Fire TV, and it has even launched Amazon Game Studio to produce its own titles. The first original game is Sev Zero, a tower-defense game with third-person shooter aspects. Sev Zero comes with the $40 Amazon Fire Game Controller, which feels like a slightly cheaper Xbox 360 controller; it connects to the Fire TV through Bluetooth and runs on two AA batteries. Most gamers will want to pick up the controller, which is required for some titles. In the end, however, the Fire TV is not a direct competitor to the Xbox One or PlayStation 4. Instead, it’ll feature the kinds of games you’d play on a nice tablet.</p>
<p>Speaking of tablets, if you have a Kindle Fire HDX, you can mirror its screen to the Fire TV. The set-top box has a Chromecast-like feature, too: After you install the YouTube app on your Fire TV, you can pair a laptop, smartphone, or tablet to it. Then, on that paired device, you can tap the Cast button in YouTube, select YouTube TV as the destination, and watch that YouTube video on your television.</p>

    </div><h3><b>Extra screen, extra features</b></h3><p>Amazon also added Second Screen functions. You can fling Amazon video playing on your Kindle Fire HDX to the Fire TV and then use the tablet to control playback or to do something else. The X-Ray feature, which Amazon plans to add by the time you read this, will display IMDb-powered information about the video, such as the cast and crew, or the name of the currently playing song. Amazon says the Fire TV’s Second Screen functions will come to iOS devices later this year.</p>
<p>The FreeTime feature, also on the way, will allow parents to set restrictions on what their children can watch and play on the Fire TV, and when.</p>
<p class="pullQuote"><b>Amazon’s set-top box is speedier than both the Apple TV and the Roku 3.</b></p>
<p>The Fire TV would benefit from more apps, including big names such as MLB.TV and PBS. HBO Go is a significant omission, but Amazon says it’s working on adding that ASAP. More music services would be welcome—and it’s a shame that at the Fire TV’s launch you can’t even access your Amazon MP3 purchases via Amazon Cloud Player (another feature that’s expected to be available by the time you read this). Image services such as Flickr would be good additions, too.</p>
<p>If you are invested in Amazon’s ecosystem—or if you have a Prime subscription but haven’t had the chance to use the Prime Instant Video library much—the Fire TV is a no-brainer. If you’ve remained ecosystem-agnostic up until now, you’ll probably like Amazon’s box: It’s speedier than the Apple TV and the Roku 3, and its game capabilities and voice search give it an edge. Once Amazon adds more apps and delivers the promised extra features, the Fire TV is gonna be hot.</p>
