<p>Let’s suppose that you work with products in a retail store. Each product typically has a unique inventory number, and you can use that number as your reference point for Vlookups. The Vlookup formula matches the ID to the corresponding ID in another sheet, so you can pull the item’s description, price, inventory level, and other data points into your current workbook.</p>
<p><b>Summon the Vlookup</b> formula in the formula menu, and enter the cell containing your reference number <b>(1)</b>. Then enter the range of cells in the sheet or workbook that you need to pull data from <b>(2)</b>, the column number for the data point you’re looking for <b>(3)</b>, and either True, if you want the closest reference match, or False, if you need an exact match <b>(4)</b>.</p>

    </div><h3><b>3. IF and IFERROR formulas</b></h3><p><b>IF AND IFERROR</b> are the two most useful types of IF formulas in Excel. IF lets you use conditional formulas that calculate in one way when a certain thing is true, and in another way when that thing is false. For example, you can identify students who scored 80 points or higher on an exam by having the cell report ‘Pass’ if the score in column C is above 80, and ‘Fail’ if it’s 79 or below.</p>
<p>IFERROR is a variant of the standard IF formula. It permits you to return a particular value (or a blank value) if the formula you’re trying to use returns an error. If you’re running a Vlookup to another sheet or table, for example, the IFERROR formula can render the field blank in any instance where the Vlookup can’t find the reference.</p>

<p>PivotTables are a summarization tool for performing calculations based on reference points that you enter.</p>
</figcaption>
    
    
    
    </div><h3><b>4. PivotTable</b></h3><p><b>A PIVOTTABLE IS</b> essentially a summary table that lets you count, average, sum, and perform other calculations based on reference points that you enter. Excel 2013 added Recommended PivotTables, making it even easier for you to create a table that displays the data you need.</p>
<p>For example, to count the number of passes and fails in a chart, put your Pass/Fail column in the Row Labels tab <b>(1)</b>, and then again in the Values section of your PivotTable <b>(2)</b>. It will usually default to the correct summary type (‘count’, in this case), but you can choose among many other functions in the Values dropdown box <b>(3)</b>. You can also create subtables that summarize data by category—such as Pass/Fail numbers by gender.</p>

Flash Fill</b></h3><p><b>EASILY THE BEST</b> new feature in Excel 2013, Flash Fill solves one of the program’s most vexing problems: how to quickly pull needed pieces of information from a concatenated cell. In the past, when working in a column with names in ‘Last, First’ format, for example, either you had to type everything out manually or you had to create a (frequently complicated) workaround.</p>
<p>Suppose that you’re working with a field of people’s names in Excel 2013. You simply type the first name of the first person in a field immediately next to the one you’re working on (<b>1</b>), and choose Home ▸ Fill ▸ Flash Fill (<b>2</b>). In response Excel will automatically extract the first names of all of the other people that are recorded in the existing field and fill the new field with them.</p>
