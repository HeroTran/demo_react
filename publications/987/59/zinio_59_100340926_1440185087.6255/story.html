    </div><p><b>S</b>ince 2010, Google Apps for Enterprise has offered third-party app integration. In March, Google rolled out a similar add-ons store (<a href="http://go.pcworld.com/driveaddons" target="_self">go.pcworld.com/driveaddons</a>) for the rest of us.</p>
<p>The premise of Google Drive’s new offering is that thirdparty services can create add-ons that bring extra functionality to Google’s Web-based word processing (Docs) and spreadsheet (Sheets) apps.</p>

    </div><p>Microsoft launched its own Apps for Office program in 2013, and some third parties, such as Avery, have provided Office desktop integration via Microsoft’s add-in program for some time.</p>
<p>For Google Docs users, the add-on system promises to introduce useful functions such as easy bibliography formatting, label creation, and integration with services such as UberConference and HelloFax.</p>
<p class="pullQuote"><b>For Docs users, add-ons promise to introduce useful functions.</b></p>
<h3><b>Adding on</b></h3><p>If you’re already using Google Drive’s Docs and Sheets, the add-ons should be available to you automatically. Installing add-ons is pretty straightforward, but spreadsheet users have one minor hurdle to overcome: To use add-ons, you need to update to the Sheets refresh (<a href="http://go.pcworld.com/sheetsupdate" target="_self">go.pcworld.com/sheetsupdate</a>) that Google introduced in December, if you haven’t already done so.</p>
<p>Start by clicking the Add-ons menu item at the top and selecting Get add-ons from the drop-down menu. Whether you’re in a word processing document or in a spreadsheet, the procedure is the same.</p>
<p class="pullQuote"><b>Right now most of the apps appear to be free, but that might change in the future.</b></p>
<p>A pop-up window shows all of the add-ons available. The design of the add-ons store is similar to that of Google’s Chrome Web Store.</p>
<p>Just select the app you want to add, and click the blue price button to install. Right now most of the apps appear to be free, but perhaps that will change in the future.</p>
<p>After you click the installation button, a permissions window comes up to disclose all the types of data the app will have access to. If you approve of the permissions the app needs, click Accept.</p>
<p>Finally, you’ll return to the word processing or spreadsheet app where you began, and in a few seconds the add-on will be installed. A balloon will drop down notifying you that the add-on is ready to use.</p>
<p>Whenever you need to tweak an installed app, simply select Manage add-ons from the Add-ons drop-down menu. Since Google Drive is Web-based, any apps you decide to install will be available in Google Drive across all of your computers.</p>
