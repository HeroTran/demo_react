    </div><p><b>WHETHER YOU’RE UNBOXING</b> a new PC or freshly installing Windows on older hardware, your job isn’t done when you boot up your desktop for the first time.</p>
<p>Performing just a handful of tasks can help ensure that your PC stays lean, mean, fully compatible with your peripherals, and all-around pleasant to use for the foreseeable future.</p>
<h3><b>On DIY machines: Unplug and update drivers</b></h3><p>Feel free to skip this section if you’re using a prebuilt, boxed PC rather than a rig you’ve cobbled together yourself.</p>
<p>Upon first boot, Windows 8.1 will contact the Windows Update site (unless otherwise configured) and install the drivers it finds for whatever components it recognizes in a system. This automatic procedure can be helpful for obscure components with drivers that don’t see frequent updates, such as a network controller or a keyboard. In contrast, however, it can be an annoyance for more critical parts, such as a GPU or a storage controller.</p>
<p>During a recent installation of Windows 8.1 that I performed on a test machine, for example, Windows started installing a graphics driver automatically in the background, while I already had a more recent version running. I spent the next half hour cleaning up the mess and starting over.</p>
<p>To prevent Windows Update or any other auto-updaters from running, disconnect from the Internet before booting Windows for the first time. Then, manually update all of your drivers yourself. Nvidia, AMD, and Intel often update graphics, chipset, and storage drivers on their websites well before Windows Update grabs them. You’ll need to have another Web-connected PC available to download the drivers, of course, and you can move them to your new PC on portable storage.</p>

    </div><h3><b>Take out the trash</b></h3><p>Store-bought systems typically ship with a bucket of bloatware preinstalled at the factory. Unless a particular preinstalled program catches your eye, get rid of it.</p>
<p>First, run a tool such as the amazing PC Decrapifier (<a href="http://go.pcworld.com/decrapifier" target="_self">go.pcworld.com/decrapifier</a>) to automate the cleaning of known bloatware. Then open the Control Panel, head to Programs ▸ Programs and Features, and work your way through the list of currently installed programs, removing anything you’re unlikely to use.</p>
<p>While you’re at it, fire up the Windows 8 Task Manager (&lt;Crtl&gt;-&lt;Shift&gt;-&lt;Esc&gt;), click the Startup tab, and disable any background programs that you don’t want to run when Windows launches. (If you’re using an older Windows, search for .............. in the Start menu and look under the Startup tab there.) Disabling unnecessary programs will free up resources as well as speed up boot time.</p>
<p>Regular housekeeping over the life of the computer won’t hurt, either. Windows itself can hog up a fair bit of drive space with temporary and junk files. Check out our guide to keeping your PC in tip-top shape (<a href="http://go.pcworld.com/tiptopshape" target="_self">go.pcworld.com/tiptopshape</a>) for further details.</p>

    </div><h3><b>Run Windows Update, again and again</b></h3><p>Next, connect to the Web and run Windows Update to patch the operating system and bring all of its components up-to-date.</p>
<p>After installing an update or some other Microsoft application (such as the Office suite), you’ll typically find that a number of new updates have become available. Continue to run Windows Update repeatedly—restarting the PC when necessary—until it lists no more critical updates for your system. Once that’s done, opt to have your computer automatically install Windows Updates as they become available, unless you have a compelling reason to avoid that setting.</p>

<p>A good security utility or suite is a must for any PC.</p>

    </div><h3><b>Install your apps</b></h3><p>Install applications only after updating Windows, to ensure that you have the latest compatibility patches—something that is especially important with a fledgling OS such as Windows 8.1. Wondering what to grab? See our guide to 22 free programs to install on your new PC (<a href="http://go.pcworld.com/22programs" target="_self">go.pcworld.com/22programs</a>). The nifty Ninite (<a href="http://go.pcworld.com/ninite" target="_self">go.pcworld.com/ninite</a>) automates the installation of many popular apps, saving you time. Install security and antivirus tools, of course. And snag Secunia Personal Software Inspector (<a href="http://go.pcworld.com/secunia_psi" target="_self">go.pcworld.com/secunia_psi</a>), a tool that keeps your other apps current.</p>
<h3><b>Back up, back up, back up</b></h3><p>Back up your new PC, and make it an ongoing habit. I suggest using Windows’ imaging tool (<a href="http://go.pcworld.com/freebackup" target="_self">go.pcworld.com/freebackup</a>) or a similar thirdparty utility to take a complete snapshot of the OS volume and then squirreling it away, in case you need to return the Windows installation to like-new condition. Keep this image separate from your regular backups.</p>
<p>With a backup in hand, the bloatware gone, the awesomeware installed, and everything patched, your new PC should be ready to go!</p>
