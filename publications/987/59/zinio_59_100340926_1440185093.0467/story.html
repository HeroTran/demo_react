    </div><p><b>MODERN BROWSERS</b> are chock-full of powerful hidden features, but one of the most overlooked is incognito or private mode. Some people call it “porn mode,” but there are all kinds of reasons to use this mode that don’t involve websites with three Xs in the title.</p>
<p>Incognito mode can help keep your browsing private from other users, but it can’t keep your activities secret from your ISP or from online snoops. (For that, you need a VPN.) All incognito mode does is erase your browsing and search histories, as well as dump any tracking cookies you pick up, during your session. If you’re unsure how to turn on private mode, you can find instructions for Chrome (<a href="http://go.pcworld.com/chromeincog" target="_self">go.pcworld.com/chromeincog</a>), Firefox (<a href="http://go.pcworld.com/ffprivate" target="_self">go.pcworld.com/ffprivate</a>), and Internet Explorer (<a href="http://go.pcworld.com/ieprivate" target="_self">go.pcworld.com/ieprivate</a>).</p>
<p class="pullQuote"><b>You might want to cover your tracks when searching for sensitive information.</b></p>
<h3><b>Circumvent leaky paywalls</b></h3><p>Several websites put most of their content behind paywalls but allow you to view a limited number of articles for free per month before insisting on a subscription. The paywalls are designed with ways around that restriction: For example, sites such as that of the New York Times will let you read an article for free if you follow a link from Facebook, Twitter, or another social network even after you hit your limit.</p>
<p>A much simpler option, however, is to open your browser in incognito mode and then visit the site. That way, no cookies remain on your PC, and every time you browse to a leaky-paywall site, it will regard you as a new visitor with a fresh article limit.</p>
<h3><b>Keep accounts private on a public PC</b></h3><p>Thanks to smartphones, tablets, and laptops, these days you rarely need to visit the PCs at an Internet café or library to access your online accounts on the go—but every now and then it happens. Public locations often have PCs that are poorly maintained and may not erase your browsing history after your session.</p>
<p>To make sure nobody stumbles across the login page for any of your personal accounts, use incognito mode when you browse on a public PC. The protection isn’t bulletproof, but combined with your instructing sites not to store your password (as well as your using a dash of common sense), incognito mode becomes an effective tool.</p>
<h3><b>Leave no trace of your data</b></h3><p>You might want to cover your tracks when searching for sensitive information or conducting transactions. Perhaps you want to learn about a medical condition, and you would rather not have the search terms pop up later on the family PC. Or maybe you’re shopping for a surprise gift, and you don’t want anyone to see what you were up to at Amazon or Overstock. Really, the reasons for keeping some portions of your history private are endless.</p>
