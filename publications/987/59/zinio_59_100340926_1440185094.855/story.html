    </div><p><b>Q: I’M TRYING TO LEARN</b> more about safe computing, and I have heard of the dangers of having one’s IP address revealed. How does this happen? What could I do to protect against this?—Melanie</p>
<p><b>A: ALL INTERNET COMMUNICATIONS</b> require Internet Protocol addresses. If a website you visited couldn’t see your IP address, it couldn’t send you pages, images, files, and so on.</p>
<p>To learn how easily a site can see your IP address, visit What Is My IP Address (<a href="http://whatismyipaddress.com" target="_self">whatismyipaddress.com</a>), or just type what’s my ip address in a Google search. Your IP address is easier to get than your telephone number.</p>
<p class="pullQuote"><b>If you use a router, sites see only your router’s IP address, not your PC’s.</b></p>
<p>The situation is not as scary as it sounds, however. Assuming that you’re using a router (as you should), websites can see only the router’s IP address, not your PC’s. They can’t tell who in the house is visiting them—a small comfort, I admit, but this arrangement also protects you from certain drive-by malware attacks.</p>
<p>What can website administrators find out about you from your router’s IP address? They can identify your Internet service provider and figure out approximately where you’re located. They will likely be able to identify your neighborhood, but not your home. And they can see how often you (or someone else sharing your router) visit their website.</p>
<p>They won’t be able to see that kind of information forever, though. Chances are, your IP address is not a permanent fixture: Most home Internet accounts use a dynamic IP address, which your ISP changes from time to time.</p>
<p>And, of course, if you take your laptop to a coffee house or a library, you’ll have an entirely different IP address there (as well as public-network security issues to consider).</p>
<p>If you’re still worried, you can use a virtual private network. Once you have set up a VPN, your Internet connections travel encrypted from your computer to the VPN server, and from there they move unencrypted to their final destination. The sites you visit see only the VPN’s IP address. The problem, of course, is that the VPN can see everything you do.</p>
<p>I don’t use a VPN on a regular basis, but when I do, I use the free version of CyberGhost (<a href="http://cyberghostvpn.com" target="_self">cyberghostvpn.com</a>). I’m satisfied with it.</p>
