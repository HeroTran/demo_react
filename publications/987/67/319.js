Consequently, Google might not be aware of information that would support leaving the search result intact.</p>\n<p>Google has criticized the ruling in the past but says that it’s working to comply with the law nonetheless. Its late-July letter was in response to a questionnaire from regulators seeking more details about how it handles the requests.</p>\n<h3><b>Thousands of requests</b></h3><p>As of July 18, Google had received more than 91,000 requests involving more than 328,000 URLs. In the July 31 letter, the company acknowledges removing around 53 percent of those URLs, declining to remove about a third of them, and requesting more information in 15 percent of cases. It goes on to say that those percentages could shift over time.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0012-0112/93070-1-eng-GB/f0012-012.jpg\" width=\"758\" height=\"442\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0012-01\" title=\"f0012-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>The ruling</b> makes specific demands on search engine operators.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>Reasons Google might not grant a request include situations in which removing the link would not be in the public interest, or if the contents of a link involve political speech, it says.</p>\n<p>As of the July 31 letter, people in France and Germany had submitted the most requests, at 17,500 and 16,500, respectively, followed by the United Kingdom with 12,000 requests, Spain with 8000, Italy with 7500, and Holland with 5500.</p>\n<p>Some webmasters have complained to Google about the removal of links to their sites, the company says.</p>\n<p>Other parties besides Google have criticized the ruling. In late July a UK House of Lords subcommittee said the ruling was unworkable and misguided, and that it could be particularly damaging for smaller search engines that don’t have the resources to handle such requests.</p>\n<p>Google provides a form online for removal requests. So does Microsoft’s Bing. “We continue to work out the details of the process we’ll use to evaluate the requests,” a Microsoft spokesperson says.</p>\n<p class=\"pullQuote\">As of July 18, Google had received more than 91,000 requests to remove URLs.</p>\n","layout":{},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":0,"link_source":"","competition":[],"flatplan_title":"","notes":"","gutter_credit":"","other":"","image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1440188985.1757","name":"f0010-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0010-0113/93084-1-eng-GB/f0010-012.jpg?t=default_ipad_portrait&ext/f0010-012_default_ipad_portrait.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"768","height":"590","legacy_id":"9424","is_default":true},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1440188985.1757","name":"f0010-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0010-0113/93084-1-eng-GB/f0010-012.jpg?t=default_ipad_landscape&ext/f0010-012_default_ipad_landscape.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"1000","height":"768","legacy_id":"9424","is_default":false}],"related_objects":{"image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_2_1440188983.5591","name":"f0012-01","source":"","caption":"<p><b>The ruling</b> makes specific demands on search engine operators.</p>\n","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0012-0112/93070-1-eng-GB/f0012-012.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"758","height":"442","legacy_id":"9422"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_2_1440188983.5591","name":"f0012-01","source":"","caption":"<p><b>The ruling</b> makes specific demands on search engine operators.</p>\n","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0012-0112/93070-1-eng-GB/f0012-012.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"758","height":"442","legacy_id":"9422"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_1_1440188984.5474","name":"f0011-01","source":"","caption":"<p><b>In its letter</b> to regulators, Google expresses its concerns about the ruling.</p>\n","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0011-0121/93077-1-eng-GB/f0011-012.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"813","height":"516","legacy_id":"9423"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_1_1440188984.5474","name":"f0011-01","source":"","caption":"<p><b>In its letter</b> to regulators, Google expresses its concerns about the ruling.</p>\n","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0011-0121/93077-1-eng-GB/f0011-012.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"813","height":"516","legacy_id":"9423"}]},"url_alias":"http://pcworld-us.audiencemedia.com","type":"story","order":"0","folio_number":"10","folio_numbers":"10,11,12,13","pdf_page_index":"10","thumbnail":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0010-0113/93084-1-eng-GB/f0010-012.jpg?t=tablet_story_thumbnail&ext/f0010-012_tablet_story_thumbnail.jpg","color":"FFFFFF","real_id":"9421","main_section_id":"319","ads":[]},{"id":"zinio_67_100340926_1440188986.4995","title":"Office for iPad gains PDF export, flick gestures","sub_title":"","author":[{"id":"0","name":"MARK HACHMAN","email":"noreply@audiencemedia.com","is_default":false}],"tag":"","strap_line":"","intro":"","body":"<p class=\"byline\"><b>BY MARK HACHMAN</b></p>\n<p><b>IN LATE JULY,</b> Microsoft updated its three Office for iPad apps—Word, Excel, and PowerPoint—with new features, including PDF export, presentation views, and a new flick gesture.</p>\n<p>The three apps are now upgraded to version 1.1 in the Apple App Store. Microsoft announced Office for iPad in March, and the elegant port of the office suite has so far received (mostly) glowing reviews. “Millions” of users have downloaded the apps, according to a blog post <a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/offipadblog\" target=\"_self\">(go.pcworld.com/offipadblog)</a> by Microsoft’s Office team.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0014-0126/93120-1-eng-GB/f0014-012.jpg\" width=\"902\" height=\"836\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0014-01\" title=\"f0014-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>Cropping an</b> embedded photo is even easier with a number of preset dimensions.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div>\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0015-0130/93113-1-eng-GB/f0015-012.jpg\" width=\"731\" height=\"549\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0015-01\" title=\"f0015-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>Improvements</b> to PivotTables are a notable addition to Excel for iPad.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>While Excel and PowerPoint each received their own unique updates, all three apps gained several common features, including the frequently requested ability to export documents as PDF files. In addition, you can manually crop photos and images in all three apps using a new crop tool that allows you to choose from a list of popular preset sizes or to create your own. (A reset button is included too.) Finally, Office for iPad now has the ability to import external fonts.</p>\n<h3><b>Excel: External keyboards enter the picture</b></h3><p>As any data-entry specialist knows, an external keyboard can be essential to the task of crunching numbers. The new update adds support for such keyboards to the Excel app.</p>\n<p>In addition, Excel can now interact with PivotTables that have source data in the same workbook, and it also boasts improved print options. The spreadsheet program has gained one nifty little gesture, too: When you “flick” from a cell containing data, you select all of the cells along that row or column, out through the next open cell. With this gesture available, you no longer have to pick and choose cells, or to navigate menu options.</p>\n<h3><b>PowerPoint: Presentation Mode debuts</b></h3><p>The most dramatic update to the PowerPoint app is the addition of Presentation Mode, which allows you to view your notes on your tablet while projecting the formal presentation on another screen. (Google’s competing Chromebox for Meetings, coincidentally, added a similar feature the same week.) You can now enhance your presentations with background music or video. And according to Microsoft, the PowerPoint app’s new eraser and pen settings make annotations even easier.</p>\n<p>Microsoft has said previously that it’s busy putting its services on as many platforms as possible. The updates to Office for iPad certainly help that cause.</p>\n<p class=\"pullQuote\">PowerPoint’s new Presentation Mode lets you view your notes on your tablet.</p>\n","layout":{},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":0,"link_source":"","competition":[],"flatplan_title":"","notes":"","gutter_credit":"","other":"","image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1440188987.3768","name":"f0014-01","source":"","caption":"<p><b>Cropping an</b> embedded photo is even easier with a number of preset dimensions.</p>\n","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0014-0126/93120-1-eng-GB/f0014-012.jpg?t=default_ipad_portrait&ext/f0014-012_default_ipad_portrait.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"768","height":"712","legacy_id":"9428","is_default":true},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1440188987.3768","name":"f0014-01","source":"","caption":"<p><b>Cropping an</b> embedded photo is even easier with a number of preset dimensions.</p>\n","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0014-0126/93120-1-eng-GB/f0014-012.jpg?t=default_ipad_landscape&ext/f0014-012_default_ipad_landscape.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"829","height":"768","legacy_id":"9428","is_default":false}],"related_objects":{"image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_1_1440188986.6575","name":"f0015-01","source":"","caption":"<p><b>Improvements</b> to PivotTables are a notable addition to Excel for iPad.</p>\n","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0015-0130/93113-1-eng-GB/f0015-012.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"731","height":"549","legacy_id":"9427"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_1_1440188986.6575","name":"f0015-01","source":"","caption":"<p><b>Improvements</b> to PivotTables are a notable addition to Excel for iPad.</p>\n","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0015-0130/93113-1-eng-GB/f0015-012.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"731","height":"549","legacy_id":"9427"}]},"url_alias":"http://pcworld-us.audiencemedia.com","type":"story","order":"1","folio_number":"14","folio_numbers":"14,15,16","pdf_page_index":"14","thumbnail":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0014-0126/93120-1-eng-GB/f0014-012.jpg?t=tablet_story_thumbnail&ext/f0014-012_tablet_story_thumbnail.jpg","color":"FFFFFF","real_id":"9426","main_section_id":"319","ads":[]},{"id":"zinio_67_100340926_1440188988.6826","title":"Now you can legally unlock your smartphone (thanks, Obama)","sub_title":"","author":[{"id":"0","name":"FLORENCE ION","email":"noreply@audiencemedia.com","is_default":false}],"tag":"","strap_line":"","intro":"","body":"<p class=\"byline\"><b>BY FLORENCE ION</b></p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0018-0130/93156-1-eng-GB/f0018-012.jpg\" width=\"2392\" height=\"2870\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0018-01\" title=\"f0018-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n <span class=\"credit\">\nPHOTOGRAPHY BY JEMAL COUNTESS/GETTY IMAGES</span></figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div>\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0019-0119/93149-1-eng-GB/f0019-012.jpg\" width=\"877\" height=\"513\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0019-01\" title=\"f0019-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>The new law</b> gives you the freedom to move your device to another carrier.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p><b>ON AUGUST 1,</b> President Barack Obama signed into law <a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/whunlock\" target=\"_self\">(go.pcworld.com/whunlock)</a> a bill that allows U.S. citizens to unlock their phones. That means you can take your mobile device, no matter which carrier subsidized it, and move it to a competing carrier.</p>\n<p>In late July the U.S. House of Representatives passed the bipartisan bill, after approval by the Senate. Unlocking phones had become illegal in January 2013, when an exemption to the DMCA expired.</p>\n<p>There is a bit of a catch, however: The Unlocking Consumer Choice and Wireless Competition Act, as it’s called, is valid only through 2015. For now, it ensures that you have a choice in matters regarding your mobile device, as long as your phone is compatible with another carrier’s network and you’ve complied with your previous contract. And if you don’t fancy yourself as technologically savvy, the bill allows you to seek outside help.</p>\n<p>It has been a long journey to get to this point. About a year ago, the National Telecommunications and Information Administration filed a petition <a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/ntiafcc\" target=\"_self\">(go pcworld.com/ntiafcc)</a> urging the Federal Communications Commission to make a ruling that would require carriers to unlock phones and tablets at the customer’s request. Although most carriers have been kind about unlocking devices, tools for consumers to unlock their own phones and tablets were illegal.</p>\n<p>What are you waiting for? Go forth and be free!

Shipping notifications for preorders landed in inboxes soon afterward. You can waltz into a Microsoft Store to pick up one of the new models, too.</p>\n<h3><b>Beautiful display, good battery life</b></h3><p>PCWorld Senior Editor Mark Hachman found a lot to like in the Core i5 version of the Surface Pro 3, awarding it 4 out of 5 stars in his review <a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/surpro3rev\" target=\"_self\">(go.pcworld.com/surpro3rev)</a>. In particular, he applauded the larger, gorgeous 12-inch display; the more ergonomic kickstand and Type Cover connection mechanism; and the battery life, which outdid that of previous Surface Pro generations. “With its latest tablet, Microsoft continues to home in on what buyers increasingly want: a spacious sheet of thin glass for work and play,” he wrote.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0022-0122/93185-1-eng-GB/f0022-012.jpg\" width=\"748\" height=\"351\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0022-01\" title=\"f0022-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>The kickstand’s</b> ‘friction hinge’ allows it to support any angle up to 150 degrees.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>The new versions should offer largely the same usability experience, though as the processors’ naming scheme suggests, the Core i3 model should be less potent than the Core i5 models, while the two pricey Core i7 machines should offer higher performance.

The Surface Pro 3’s Type Cover accessory is a must-have, and it’ll set you back yet another $130.

Windows Phone 8.1 deserved a lot of attention, but I can’t say the same for Update 1, which I tried on my Lumia 1520 phablet (the update wasn’t available yet for our Nokia Icon test phone). It adds a nice feature or two, but nothing earth-shattering.</p>\n<p>Download and installation took about 20 minutes or so, after which the OS reported itself as version 8.10.14147.180.</p>\n<p>Update 1 consists of several minor tweaks. A couple of them, namely an updated Windows Phone Store tile and the new ability to forward and delete SMS messages in bulk, are simple additions that you’ll quickly forget about. Others—the addition of folders and VPN support, an update to the Xbox Music app, and updates to the Cortana digital assistant—are worth exploring a little.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the net effect of my brief period of playing with the update is that my Lumia 1520 feels a touch slower. And I hit a roadblock while testing the VPN capability, which was one of the features I most wanted to try.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0024-0128/93235-1-eng-GB/f0024-012.jpg\" width=\"587\" height=\"507\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0024-01\" title=\"f0024-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>An opened folder</b> appears as a small icon at the top, with the contents grouped below.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>Folders ahoy</b></h3><p>Windows Phone 8 took a small step toward folders, introducing the ability to resize live tiles on the Start screen into small icons. With Windows Phone 8.1 Update 1, you can make those icons even smaller, and add a label to remind yourself of what’s in there.</p>\n<p>In a manner similar to working with folders on Android or iOS, you can now create folders in Windows Phone by dragging and dropping one tile over another. To close the folder, however, you need to tap the folder icon at the top of the Windows Phone screen, rather than just tapping anywhere else on the screen. That’s different from Android’s approach, and it feels a bit awkward.</p>\n<p>It’s also a bit time-intensive to drag, say, a contact out from People, pin it to the Start screen, and then drag the contact’s name into a folder. But grouping pinned apps together takes just seconds.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0025-0117/93228-1-eng-GB/f0025-012.jpg\" width=\"458\" height=\"612\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0025-01\" title=\"f0025-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>The VPN configuration</b> screen in Windows Phone 8.1 Update 1.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>VPN support: For business only</b></h3><p>Virtual private network support will prove useful for anyone who wants to access protected resources while on the go. This feature, however, is particularly designed for businesspeople or for consumers who have subscribed to a private VPN, not for casual users.</p>\n<p>To use the VPN, you need to start in the Settings menu; Microsoft then directs you to the Store to download a compatible VPN app. (You have to search for the app manually.) Afterward, you get the option of encrypting all traffic to and from the phone. You can also turn the VPN on or off, or set it to trigger when you access certain domains or sites.</p>\n<p>My first experience with the VPN function ended quickly. I tried entering the IP address and password for our office VPN, but I wasn’t able to connect. I’ll be checking with our IT department, and you may have better luck if you do the same initially.</p>\n<p>One nitpick: While editing an active VPN profile, I noticed that selecting the advanced options brings up a toggle labeled “Don’t use VPNs on company Wi-Fi,” with a default setting of Off. This double negative is needlessly confusing to users.</p>\n<h3><b>Improved Xbox Music, enhanced Cortana</b></h3><p>I didn’t notice a difference in the updated Xbox Music app—but then again, I don’t subscribe to the service. It would be great if Xbox Music for Windows Phone let users play algorithmically generated “radio” stations.</p>\n<p>Finally, there’s Cortana, which Microsoft says has new natural-language capabilities. That’s difficult to test, although a new “do an impression” request prompts Cortana (voiced by actress Jen Taylor) to run through a few famous lines. Microsoft has also adapted Cortana for the UK and China, among other regions. (At least on my phone, though, I can’t ask Cortana to speak in an English accent yet.)</p>\n<p>As for the performance drag on my Lumia 1520, that could be a matter of perception, and I might easily solve my VPN problems with help. Your mileage with Windows Phone 8.1 Update 1 may vary. In any case, there’s little reason not to upgrade. Just don’t expect much.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n

site.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p><b>AN IMAGE OF</b> an HTC One M8 running the Windows Phone operating system is currently on the Verizon Wireless site, providing compelling evidence that the company plans to sell the phone.</p>\n<p>The URL of the image on the Verizon site identifies the hardware as the “HTC M8 Windows” phone.</p>\n<p>HTC is slated to hold a media event in New York shortly before you read this, and rumors are indicating that the company plans to unveil a Windows Phone 8.1–powered version of its HTC One M8, one of the best-regarded Android phones released this year. The Verizon image appears to be proof that the handset will in fact come to market.</p>\n<p>Apparently the HTC Windows Phone is a rebadging of the Android-powered One M8, and it will be running Windows Phone 8.1 Update 1. The mobile OS update supports Voice over LTE for improved clarity, a feature that the M8 for Windows will reportedly include as well.</p>\n<p>For a closer look at the Android phone’s features, check out the review of the HTC One M8 <a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/onem8\" target=\"_self\">(go.pcworld.com/onem8)</a> by our colleagues at Greenbot. Assuming the Windows Phone version is similar, you can expect a metal chassis, a lovely 5-inch screen, and HTC’s odd dual rear-facing cameras. There’s no guarantee that HTC won’t have a few surprises up its sleeve, however.</p>\n<p>Verizon has dipped its toe into the Windows Phone market before; the carrier currently offers the aged HTC 8X for $50 on a two-year contract, for example. Windows Phone fans would be foolish to buy that model, however, when they can have the far superior Nokia Lumia Icon for free, again with a two-year contract. Until the launch of the “HTC M8 Windows,” your best bet is the Icon.</p>\n<p class=\"byline\"><b><i>—Mark Hachman</i></b></p>\n","layout":{},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":0,"link_source":"","competition":[],"flatplan_title":"","notes":"","gutter_credit":"","other":"","image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1440188996.8438","name":"f0027-01","source":"","caption":"<p><b>The HTC M8</b> Windows, as it appears on Verizon’s site.</p>\n","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0027-0118/93271-1-eng-GB/f0027-012.jpg?t=default_ipad_portrait&ext/f0027-012_default_ipad_portrait.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"496","height":"1024","legacy_id":"9445","is_default":true},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1440188996.8438","name":"f0027-01","source":"","caption":"<p><b>The HTC M8</b> Windows, as it appears on Verizon’s site.</p>\n","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0027-0118/93271-1-eng-GB/f0027-012.jpg?t=default_ipad_landscape&ext/f0027-012_default_ipad_landscape.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"372","height":"768","legacy_id":"9445","is_default":false}],"url_alias":"http://pcworld-us.audiencemedia.com","type":"story","order":"5","folio_number":"27","folio_numbers":"27","pdf_page_index":"27","thumbnail":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0027-0118/93271-1-eng-GB/f0027-012.jpg?t=tablet_story_thumbnail&ext/f0027-012_tablet_story_thumbnail.jpg","color":"FFFFFF","real_id":"9444","main_section_id":"319","ads":[]},{"id":"zinio_67_100340926_1440188997.823","title":"Avoid potentially unwanted programs","sub_title":"","author":[{"id":"0","name":"LINCOLN SPECTOR","email":"noreply@audiencemedia.com","is_default":false}],"tag":"","strap_line":"","intro":"Beware this common threat as you install free software.","body":"<p class=\"byline\"><b>BY LINCOLN SPECTOR</b></p>\n<p><b>Make smart purchases, stay safe online.</b></p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0029-0125/93377-1-eng-GB/f0029-012.jpg\" width=\"599\" height=\"387\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0029-01\" title=\"f0029-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>The only PUP no one loves</b></h3><p>They’re called PUPs—potentially unwanted programs—and they sneak onto your system as accessories to the program you actually intend to install.

So I downloaded FreeAudioVideoSoft’s All Free ISO Ripper. As I walked through the installation wizard, I found something of a PUP mother lode. Every dirty trick I knew, and a few I hadn’t seen before, popped up. This made the ISO ripper a perfect tool for teaching people how to install a program—and only that program.</p>\n<p>So let’s click Next and get on with it.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0031-0118/93363-1-eng-GB/f0031-012.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"402\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0031-01\" title=\"f0031-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>A false sense of security</b></h3><p>Okay, this second page of the wizard looks pretty harmless.

digital security says that you should never let strangers roam your network without your permission. But if you’re a Comcast customer, that’s exactly what will happen as the company’s Xfinity WiFi service rolls out. Fortunately, there’s a way for you to bar the door.</p>\n<h3><b>With Xfinity WiFi, we’re all hotspots now</b></h3><p>If you live in a major metropolitan area on the East Coast or in the Midwest, chances are Xfinity WiFi is already operating in your area. The service takes advantage of the dual-band (2.5GHz/5GHz) Xfinity Wireless Gateway 2 modem (model DPC3939) that it has been distributing to customers for the past year. Comcast reserves one band and antenna for your own use, and one to serve as a public Xfinity WiFi hotspot.</p>\n<p>There’s an easy way to tell whether the public hotspot is enabled on your modem: You should see an “xfinitywifi” public SSID broadcast from your own router. To access the public hotspot, users will need a Comcast Xfinity login and password.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0041-0117/93427-1-eng-GB/f0041-012.jpg\" width=\"951\" height=\"658\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0041-01\" title=\"f0041-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>Comcast says</b> it will give you plenty of notice before your modem is enabled for the Xfinity WiFi service.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>Comcast has already installed 1 million Xfinity WiFi hotspots across the nation, with plans to reach 8 million by the end of the year. Target metropolitan areas include Atlanta, Baltimore, Boston, Chicago, Denver, Detroit, Hartford, Houston, Indianapolis, Miami, Minneapolis, Nashville, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Portland, Sacramento, Salt Lake City, San Francisco, Seattle, and Washington D.C., Comcast says.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0042-0131/93420-1-eng-GB/f0042-012.jpg\" width=\"296\" height=\"280\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0042-01\" title=\"f0042-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>All you’ll need</b> to log in to Xfinity WiFi is your Xfinity username and password.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>Comcast customers at the “Performance” (25-megabits-persecond [mbps]) tier or above will be able to surf on any public Xfinity WiFi hotspot for an unlimited amount of time, for free. (If you’re a Comcast customer at a slower tier, or not a customer at all, you can try it free for two one-hour sessions, according to a Comcast spokesperson.)</p>\n<p>To ensure that your bandwidth isn’t monopolized, only five people will be able to sign on to an Xfinity Wi-Fi hotspot at one time, the spokesperson added.</p>\n<h3><b>Is sharing safe?</b></h3><p>Whether this raises security issues is a more difficult question to answer. According to Comcast, if someone logs on and begins downloading pornography, for example, such actions will be linked to that person’s account. You won’t be liable for their actions, the spokesperson said.</p>\n<p>But whether that person will be able to access other devices on your network, including your hard drive, is a separate question. And Comcast’s response isn’t reassuring.</p>\n<p>Comcast encourages users to set strong passwords, and it supplies antivirus software to its customers. If the company does detect an unusual amount or source of traffic, such as a customer who may have been infected by a virus and turned into a zombie, or bot <a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/internetbot\" target=\"_self\">(go.pcworld.com/internetbot)</a>, that customer will be notified.</p>\n<p>That doesn’t answer the question of whether, say, an elderly customer surfing away on an unprotected PC will be unduly exposed by Xfinity WiFi. Comcast recommends that customers use antivirus protection plus a firewall and take advantage of its gateway’s 128-bit WPA and WPA2 encryption. “If a consumer doesn’t put in the necessary precautions, to at least take some of these steps, they’re not doing everything they can to protect their account,” the spokesperson said.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0043-0123/93413-1-eng-GB/f0043-012.jpg\" width=\"332\" height=\"598\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0043-01\" title=\"f0043-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>This is the</b> Xfinity Wireless Gateway 2 modem that Comcast has been distributing to customers for the past year.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>Opting out</b></h3><p>Comcast says that users should have been notified of their router’s evolution into an Xfinity hotspot via email, mailers, and even a press release.

Here’s the process, as noted by Dwight Silverman <a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/optout\" target=\"_self\">(go.pcworld.com/optout)</a>:</p>\n<p>• Log in to your Comcast account page at <a href=\"http://customer.comcast.com/\" target=\"_self\">customer.comcast.com</a>.</p>\n<p>• Click on Users &amp; Preferences.</p>\n<p>• Look for a heading on the page for “Service Address.” Below your address, click the link that reads Manage Xfinity WiFi.</p>\n<p>• Click the Disable Xfinity Wifi Home Hotspot button.</p>\n<p>• Click Save.</p>\n<p>You can also call Comcast and ask that they put the modem into “bridge mode.”</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0044-0131/93406-1-eng-GB/f0044-012.jpg\" width=\"390\" height=\"392\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0044-01\" title=\"f0044-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>One great</b> alternative to the Comcast Xfinity gateway is this simple, inexpensive cable modem from Arris and Motorola.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>The answer: Buy an approved third-party router</b></h3><p>The easiest way, of course, is to simply ditch Comcast’s modem entirely. PCWorld Contributor Eric Geier gets into the nuts and bolts of how to do it <a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/ditchcomcast\" target=\"_self\">(go.pcworld.com/ditchcomcast)</a>. To its credit, Comcast makes the process simple from its end as well.</p>\n<p>First, check Comcast’s site to see whether your existing cable modem is expiring <a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/expire\" target=\"_self\">(go.pcworld.com/expire)</a>, as Comcast may not tell you. An older modem may be hobbling your premiumbroadband service. Proceed to Comcast’s dedicated site to buy a new cable modem <a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/buymodem\" target=\"_self\">(go.pcworld.com/buymodem)</a>.</p>\n<p>On the Comcast site, you’ll find prices as low as $70 (new from Amazon) for the Arris/Motorola SB6121 bare-bones modem. (On the low end, of course, you’ll need to supply a separate router.) Have a look at the specs, too: The SB6121 can download at a rate of 172 megabits per second and upload at up to 131 mpbs. That’s more than enough for most small families, especially if your service is rated at only, say, 16 mbps. But if you’re thinking of upgrading to the Extreme 150 tier, for example, that might be pushing it a bit. The $90 Arris SB6141 downloads up to 343 mbps at a time.</p>\n<p>You can also pay more, if you wish, to buy a true gateway with integrated router capabilities, including the most recent 802.11ac technology for higher-bandwidth wireless streaming and MoCA support for using your existing coaxial cables as wired networking cables.</p>\n<p>It’s fairly certain that the third-party gateways on Comcast’s site won’t suddenly sprout Xfinity WiFi capabilities. Simply buy Comcast’s low-end recommended modem and attach your own router to it—either one you already own or a new model. (See PCWorld’s roundup of the best 802.11ac routers of 2013 <a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/80211acroundup\" target=\"_self\">[go.pcworld.com/80211acroundup]</a>.)</p>\n<p>The most annoying part of the process may be returning your existing router and phoning in your new router’s MAC (media access control) address to ensure it can be identified by your cable provider.</p>\n<h3><b>Control, and peace of mind</b></h3><p>So far, Comcast hasn’t given any indication that it will penalize users for not adopting its Xfinity WiFi router. In other words, you can opt out of supplying a public Wi-Fi hotspot, and still take advantage of other Xfinity hotspots in airports and elsewhere. (Or Starbucks, for that matter.) And with 4G cellular plans becoming cheaper, there’s always the option of tethering to your phone, too.</p>\n<p>The bottom line, however, is that owning your own cable modem allows you to save money and control your own security. And if Comcast’s new Xfinity WiFi hotspot network weirds you out, that’s another reason to switch.</p>\n<p class=\"pullQuote\">Owning your own cable modem allows you to save money and control your own

Kobeissi, is back with another easy-to-use encryption tool. This time it’s a free Chrome app called miniLock <a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/minilock\" target=\"_self\">(go.pcworld.com/minilock)</a> that aims to make it easy to create and share single encrypted files with others.</p>\n<p>Similar to other encryption tools, miniLock relies on public-key cryptography. Under this scheme you have to share your public key with others so that they can encrypt files meant for you and only you. But unlike many encryption tools, miniLock is very easy to understand and use.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0046-0128/93470-1-eng-GB/f0046-012.jpg\" width=\"898\" height=\"598\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0046-01\" title=\"f0046-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>The public key itself, dubbed your miniLock ID, is relatively short at around 45 characters. But it’s still too long to remember easily, so you’ll want to write it down or save it in a password manager such as LastPass or KeePass.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0047-0123/93463-1-eng-GB/f0047-012.jpg\" width=\"342\" height=\"356\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0047-01\" title=\"f0047-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>This is what</b> miniLock looks like once it has generated a public key.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>Implementation is key</b></h3><p>The encryption scheme that miniLock employs is Curve25519 elliptic-curve cryptography, which is the same type of cryptography that Cryptocat uses. However, the problem with encryption tools often isn’t the strength of their encryption but how well the encryption is implemented.</p>\n<p>Judging the quality of the cryptography is beyond the scope of this article. But on the miniLock site <a href=\"http://minilock.io/\" target=\"_self\">(minilock.io)</a>, you can find a recent miniLock security audit by penetration-testing firm Cure53. The report gave miniLock a clean bill of health.</p>\n<p>For anyone who wants to dive in right away, here’s a quick hands-on tour of miniLock on a Windows 8.1 PC.</p>\n<h3><b>Generating your ID</b></h3><p>To get started, visit the Chrome Web Store <a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/minilockapp\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/minilockapp</a> and install miniLock as you would any other Chrome app. Then you can either launch it right from the Chrome Web Store or via the Chrome App Launcher <a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/chromeapplaunch\" target=\"_self\">(go.pcworld.com/chromeapplaunch)</a> in your taskbar, if you’ve installed that.</p>\n<p>When it starts up, miniLock will ask you to sign in with your email address and a passphrase. The app will use these two pieces of information to generate your miniLock ID, which should take only a second or two.</p>\n<p>In my tests, miniLock was fairly picky about passphrases. I tried using a ten-character randomly generated passphrase with capital and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. That should make for a fairly solid password if you ask me—but for miniLock it wasn’t strong enough.</p>\n<p>Instead, the app suggested that I use one of its auto-generated passphrases, which consist of a series of random dictionary words. To make things easier, I used one of the passphrases generated by miniLock, but you could also write your own. Just make sure it’s unique and memorable enough that you won’t forget it. Otherwise, storing it in a password manager will be important. As with other encryption tools, if you lose that passphrase, you won’t be able to unlock any files sent to you with that miniLock ID.</p>\n<p>Now that you have your own ID set up, let’s encrypt a file to see how it works. Make sure you back up the test file in unencrypted form just in case something goes wrong.</p>\n<p>To choose a file, either tap the file-drop area in the miniLock window or drag a file from File Explorer and drop it in the miniLock window. You’ll then see the miniLock window flip around and reveal space for entering up to four miniLock IDs.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0048-0130/93456-1-eng-GB/f0048-012.jpg\" width=\"353\" height=\"369\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0048-01\" title=\"f0048-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>This file</b> is ready for encryption.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>By default, your miniLock ID will appear at the top, as you are the person encrypting the file.</p>\n<p>Below that, you have the option to add another three people you want to be able to access the encrypted the file—assuming you have their miniLock ID. If you wanted to send this file to one person and didn’t want to have access to it yourself, you could just click the X to the far right of your miniLock ID to remove your key.</p>\n<p>You also have an option underneath the filename to have miniLock to create a random filename—something you might do if you want to be really secretive about what you’re sending.</p>\n<p>Once the IDs for every recipient are ready to go, tap the arrow at the bottom of the window to start the encryption process. Depending on the size of the file, it could take a few seconds or a few minutes to finish.</p>\n<p>After the encryption is done, the app will tell you “Your encrypted file is ready” in small letters below the filename. Next, click on the filename to save the file to your PC via Chrome’s downloads manager.</p>\n<p>Now that you have an encrypted file, you can send it to the intended recipients any way you like: email, instant message, USB key, Facebook—the choices are seemingly endless.</p>\n<h3><b>Decrypting</b></h3><p>Decrypting a file is even easier than encrypting. Once you receive your miniLock-encrypted file via email (or whatever method), download it to your PC and drop it into the miniLock window. As long as you are signed in to miniLock and the file is encrypted with your miniLock ID, the file will be automatically decrypted. Then you can save it to your PC the same way you did with the encrypted file.</p>\n<p>That’s about all there is to miniLock. The only drawback that some people might find is that you have to sign-in every time you open the app. MiniLock does not save your login across user sessions. That was likely a conscious choice to protect your privacy. Still, some people may find the constant logins to be a drawback.</p>\n<p class=\"pullQuote\">The only drawback: You have to sign in every time you open the miniLock app.</p>\n","layout":{},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":0,"link_source":"","competition":[],"flatplan_title":"","notes":"","gutter_credit":"","other":"","image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1440189010.5524","name":"f0046-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0046-0128/93470-1-eng-GB/f0046-012.jpg?t=default_ipad_portrait&ext/f0046-012_default_ipad_portrait.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"768","height":"511","legacy_id":"9470","is_default":true},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1440189010.5524","name":"f0046-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0046-0128/93470-1-eng-GB/f0046-012.jpg?t=default_ipad_landscape&ext/f0046-012_default_ipad_landscape.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"1024","height":"682","legacy_id":"9470","is_default":false}],"related_objects":{"image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_2_1440189008.949","name":"f0048-01","source":"","caption":"<p><b>This file</b> is ready for encryption.</p>\n","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0048-0130/93456-1-eng-GB/f0048-012.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"353","height":"369","legacy_id":"9468"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_2_1440189008.949","name":"f0048-01","source":"","caption":"<p><b>This file</b> is ready for encryption.</p>\n","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0048-0130/93456-1-eng-GB/f0048-012.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"353","height":"369","legacy_id":"9468"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_1_1440189009.941","name":"f0047-01","source":"","caption":"<p><b>This is what</b> miniLock looks like once it has generated a public key.</p>\n","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0047-0123/93463-1-eng-GB/f0047-012.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"342","height":"356","legacy_id":"9469"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_1_1440189009.941","name":"f0047-01","source":"","caption":"<p><b>This is what</b> miniLock looks like once it has generated a public key.</p>\n","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0047-0123/93463-1-eng-GB/f0047-012.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"342","height":"356","legacy_id":"9469"}]},"url_alias":"http://pcworld-us.audiencemedia.com","type":"story","order":"8","folio_number":"46","folio_numbers":"46,47,48,49","pdf_page_index":"46","thumbnail":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0046-0128/93470-1-eng-GB/f0046-012.jpg?t=tablet_story_thumbnail&ext/f0046-012_tablet_story_thumbnail.jpg","color":"FFFFFF","real_id":"9467","main_section_id":"319","ads":[]},{"id":"zinio_67_100340926_1440189011.6241","title":"Samsung ATIV Book 9: It sounds as good as it looks","sub_title":"","author":[{"id":"0","name":"MICHAEL BROWN","email":"noreply@audiencemedia.com","is_default":false}],"tag":"","strap_line":"","intro":"The audio features of this laptop are no gimmick, but do they justify the price tag?","body":"<p class=\"byline\"><b>BY MICHAEL BROWN</b></p>\n<p>TESTED IN PCWORLD LABS In this section, hardware &amp;

But I won’t lump Samsung’s 2014 ATIV Book 9 <a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/ativ9\" target=\"_self\">(go.pcworld.com/ativ9)</a> in that crowd, because it sounds absolutely divine—especially with headphones.</p>\n<p>The Samsung ATIV Book 9 is a beautiful, elegantly thin laptop that will turn heads when you pull it out of your designer messenger bag. It’s the thinnest, sexiest notebook we’ve reviewed this year. But it’s much more pedestrian under the hood—with one exception. It’s equipped with a Wolfson WM5102 audio CODEC (encoder/decoder). Wolfson produces some of the world’s finest DACs (digital-to-analog converters).</p>\n<p>But it’s not entirely accurate to describe the ATIV Book 9 as being equipped with a Wolfson DAC. I don’t mean to split hairs, but that description might lead you to think that this laptop is equipped with the same type of audio subsystem found in high-end outboard DACs. Wolfson’s WM5102 was designed for smartphones. It does have a DAC, but this one chip also integrates a host of other functions that are handled by discrete processors in top-shelf audio gear.</p>\n<p class=\"pullQuote\">The Samsung ATIV Book 9, however, is the best-sounding laptop that I’ve ever listened to.</p>\n<p>The ATIV Book 9, however, is the bestsounding laptop that I’ve ever listened to. The DAC inside the WM5102 can convert audio tracks with up to 24-bit resolution and sample rates up to 192kHz and deliver them to its headphone jack at an exceptionally high signal-to-noise ratio of 113 decibels (this according to Wolfson’s data sheet). I don’t have the measurement gear to verify that claim, but I can tell you that my ears definitely enjoyed the experience.</p>\n<p>I automatically installed Foobar2000 (<a href=\"http://foobar2000.org\" target=\"_self\">foobar2000.org</a>) on the ATIV Book 9, because I’ve never encountered a fresh-from-the-factory Windows computer than could handle FLAC files.</p>\n<p>But then I found ArcSoft’s S Player+ on the ATIV Book 9. This audio/video player is exceedingly basic, but when you use it to play losslessly encoded audio tracks, it gives you the option to play them in “lossless music mode” through the headphone jack. And for a while, I thought that this was the only way to tap the Wolfson WM5102, because the tracks didn’t sound nearly as good when I played them using Foobar2000.</p>\n<p class=\"pullQuote\">Foobar 2000 was able to play all my high-resolution tracks.</p>\n<p>After a few email exchanges with Samsung, I learned that S Player+ uses Microsoft’s WASAPI (Windows Audio Session API) to take complete control of the Wolfson WM5102. Using WASAPI, S Player+ can send an audio bit stream directly to the Wolfson WM5102, bypassing the Windows mixer and muting all other sounds. Once I installed the WASAPI component in Foobar2000, tracks on that player sounded just as sweet as they did with S Player+. And unlike that software, Foobar2000 was able to play all my high-resolution tracks.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0055-0125/93520-1-eng-GB/f0055-012.jpg\" width=\"880\" height=\"495\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0055-01\" title=\"f0055-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>S Player+</b> can play FLAC files.

But with Samsung expecting the model reviewed here to fetch $1500, I had to dig deeper to determine if its price-to-performance ratio is reasonable.</p>\n<h3><b>So what else you got?</b></h3><p>That $1500 buys you an Intel Core i5-4200U CPU with integrated graphics driving a 15.6-inch touchscreen at 1920 by 1080 pixels. The system also comes with 8GB of memory, but only a 128GB SSD.</p>\n<p>Spend another $130, and you can get Toshiba’s Satellite P50t-BST2N01 with a Core i7 processor, 16GB memory and a discrete AMD GPU driving its 15.6-inch display at 4K resolution.</p>\n<p>The Toshiba is thicker and heavier, its audio components aren’t anywhere near as luscious, and its battery life is appalling, but that’s a lot of extras for not very much money. And then there’s Dell’sInspiron 15 7000-series laptop, also with a Core i7 CPU, and a discrete Nvidia GPU driving its 15.6-inch touchscreen at the same resolution as the Samsung.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0056-0133/93513-1-eng-GB/f0056-012.jpg\" width=\"756\" height=\"467\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0056-01\" title=\"f0056-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>No one would dispute</b> that Samsung has built a beautiful laptop.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div>\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0057-0124/93506-1-eng-GB/f0057-012.jpg\" width=\"615\" height=\"531\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0057-01\" title=\"f0057-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>The presence of an SSD</b> helped the ATIV Book 9 edge past Dell’s Core i7-powered Inspiron 7537.

Its backlit, island-style keyboard feels awesome under the fingertips. And its oversized trackpad is exceedingly responsive and accurate. And despite its slim proportions, Samsung’s engineers managed to squeeze in two USB 3.0 ports, one USB 2.0 port, a full-sized HDMI out, gigabit ethernet, an SD card slot, and even an analog video output.</p>\n<h3><b>Performance</b></h3><p>In terms of benchmarks, the ATIV Book 9 squeaked past Dell’s Inspiron 7537 in our Laptop WorldBench 9 benchmark suite. This can be attributed to the presence of an SSD in the Samsung versus the mechanical hard drive in Dell’s machine. PCMark 8—which is one component in that suite—is particularly sensitive to storage performance. But Samsung’s reliance on integrated graphics resulted in its getting crushed in our gaming benchmarks. This is clearly not the machine to buy if you intend to play AAA games. Battery life, on the other hand, is excellent.</p>\n<p>The Samsung ATIV Book 9 is one of the sexiest laptops to come through the Lab this year, but it’s expensive for the processing power, memory, storage, and video resolution it has to offer. If you’re passionate about high-quality audio, this laptop’s premium price tag is probably justified. Just be sure to install Foobar2000 and its WASAPI component before you plug in your favorite headphones.</p>\n<p class=\"pullQuote\">If you’re passionate about high-quality audio, its price tag is probably justified.</p>\n<h3><b>Samsung ATIV Book 9 (2014 Edition)</b></h3><p><b>PROS:</b></p>\n<p>• Excellent build quality</p>\n<p>• Very high-quality audio subsystem</p>\n<p>• Every I/O port you could want</p>\n<p><b>CONS:</b></p>\n<p>• Crappy audio software undermines the benefit of the audio hardware</p>\n<p>• Skimps on memory and storage</p>\n<p><b>BOTTOM LINE:</b></p>\n<p>Samsung’s ATIV Book 9 is an exquisitely designed laptop with an unusually high-quality audio subsystem, but it’s also very expensive.</p>\n<p>$1500</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0054-0131/93499-1-eng-GB/f0054-012.jpg\" width=\"96\" height=\"18\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0054-01\" title=\"f0054-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div>","layout":{},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":0,"link_source":"","competition":[],"flatplan_title":"","notes":"","gutter_credit":"","other":"","image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1440189014.6268","name":"f0052-01","source":"","caption":"<p><b>Samsung’s ATIV Book 9</b> measures 0.63 inches thick—and looks even thinner.</p>\n","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0052-0132/93534-1-eng-GB/f0052-012.jpg?t=default_ipad_portrait&ext/f0052-012_default_ipad_portrait.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"768","height":"626","legacy_id":"9478","is_default":true},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1440189014.6268","name":"f0052-01","source":"","caption":"<p><b>Samsung’s ATIV Book 9</b> measures 0.63 inches thick—and looks even thinner.</p>\n","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0052-0132/93534-1-eng-GB/f0052-012.jpg?t=default_ipad_landscape&ext/f0052-012_default_ipad_landscape.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"942","height":"768","legacy_id":"9478","is_default":false}],"related_objects":{"image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_5_1440189011.7745","name":"f0054-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0054-0131/93499-1-eng-GB/f0054-012.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"96","height":"18","legacy_id":"9473"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_5_1440189011.7745","name":"f0054-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0054-0131/93499-1-eng-GB/f0054-012.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"96","height":"18","legacy_id":"9473"},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_4_1440189012.2946","name":"f0057-01","source":"","caption":"<p><b>The presence of an SSD</b> helped the ATIV Book 9 edge past Dell’s Core i7-powered Inspiron 7537.

The tablet weighs a scant 1.32 pounds.</p>\n<p>Although the soft, matte-plastic back does not quite match the grippy, soft-touch texture of older ThinkPads, it feels nice.

The brightness range is wide, too, going from bright enough to compete with window glare to dim enough to read in the dark without burning out my retinas.</p>\n<p>One odd design decision is the mismatched corners. The bottom two corners are square, more in line with the boxy ThinkPad aesthetic, and they fit well in the various docks. The top corners, in contrast, are rounded.

Battery life is good for a light day’s work, lasting 5 hours, 45 minutes--just 11 minutes longer than the Dell Venue 11 Pro. Our battery-rundown test is harsh, so you might get better results. Dell still has the advantage, though, as its mobile keyboard dock comes with an extra battery that significantly boosts its run time.

Unfortunately, the docked tablet is stuck at a fixed angle, tilted too far back for my taste. To cover the screen for travel, you must take the tablet out and slot it into a different groove.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0063-0127/93570-1-eng-GB/f0063-012.jpg\" width=\"548\" height=\"361\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0063-01\" title=\"f0063-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>Also available is a desktop dock ($129), which holds the tablet at a better angle and provides two USB 3.0 ports, a full-size HDMI port, and ethernet. The tablet slots onto a physical connector that sticks up and can be tricky to seat properly.</p>\n<p>Lenovo’s Quickshot cover ($45) for the ThinkPad 10 is every bit as nice as the one that goes with the ThinkPad 8. I find using the camera on a 10-inch tablet to be a bit gimmicky, but the ThinkPad 10’s 8-megapixel rear camera takes nice shots, and the Quickshot cover makes getting into the camera app easy. The cover folds to prop up the tablet at several good angles for tabletop use. It attaches magnetically using the same guide holes as the various docks do, so you must take it off to dock the tablet.</p>\n<p>Last, but not least, the ThinkPad 10 comes with a digitizer pen. The battery-less pen writes and draws smoothly with no lag.

The Alienware 17 <a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/alien17\" target=\"_self\">(go.pcworld.com/alien17)</a> now sports curves instead of lines, lines instead of plain surfaces, and steel-gray, anodized aluminum and magnesium alloy instead of rubbery plastic.</p>\n<p>As this is a gaming notebook, however, it’s what’s on the inside that really counts. The 2014 Alienware 17 is one of the first laptops to ship with an Nvidia GeForce GTX 880M graphics card, which has a stunning 8GB of GDDR5 memory. Nvidia’s 800M-series GPUs also have new gameroriented features, including the Battery Boost mode for extending gameplay time and the ShadowPlay game-capture software.</p>\n<p>Of course, the Alienware 17 is packed with other sweet specs, too, including a fourth-generation Intel Core i7-4910MQ processor (overclocked to 4.1GHz), 16GB of DDR3/1600 memory, a 256GB solid-state drive for fast startup, and a 1TB, 5400-rpm hard drive for storage.</p>\n<p>The notebook also has built-in Wi-Fi 802.11a/b/g/n, Bluetooth 4.0, and a gigabit ethernet port, plus a slot-loading Blu-ray reader and four USB 3.0 ports. Our review model came with Windows 7 Home Premium. You can order an Alienware 17 with Windows 8.1 on Dell’s website, but be aware that this unit lacks a touchscreen. As configured, our review model cost $3385, with online discounts reducing it to $2968. That price tag puts it in the middle of high-end gaming notebooks.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0065-0124/93655-1-eng-GB/f0065-012.jpg\" width=\"337\" height=\"193\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0065-01\" title=\"f0065-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>The medium-sized</b> trackpad lights up when you touch it.</p>\n <span class=\"credit\">\nPHOTOGRAPHY BY MICHAEL HOMNICK</span></figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>Performance:Excellent</b></h3><p>The Alienware 17 performed well in our tests, achieving a Laptop WorldBench 9 score of 122. That makes the Alienware 17 the best portable performer we’ve tested so far on WorldBench 9.</p>\n<p>The graphics performance is excellent, as you might expect. (It still can’t rival the insanely powerful multiple-GPU setups you can stuff into a desktop tower, but if you’re desperate for dual-GPU performance, the 18.4-inch Alienware 18 has a dual-GeForce GTX 880M option.) With its single 880M graphics card, the Alienware 17 delivered excellent frame rates in all of our medium-quality graphics tests at resolution of 1920 by 1080 pixels. In BioShock Infinite, the Alienware 17 generated 121 frames per second; in Grid 2, it posted a frame rate of 135 fps.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0066-0129/93648-1-eng-GB/f0066-012.jpg\" width=\"615\" height=\"531\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0066-01\" title=\"f0066-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>The 2014 Alienware 17</b> is the fastest notebook we’ve ever tested.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>Design: Alienware steps up</b></h3><p>System designers can’t do much to make a massive, 17.3-inch, 9.8-pound laptop look sexy. But Dell’s Alienware team--which operates at least somewhat independently from the mothership--did a great job of refining and polishing its gaming machines. This iteration has an attractive metal cover, with well-placed curves and lines vaguely reminiscent of a Lamborghini. The laptop also feels extremely solid, as if the chassis could survive a plummet from a second-story window.</p>\n<p>Inside, it has a full-size keyboard, a numeric keypad, and a mediumsize touchpad with two discrete mouse buttons. The upper-right corner houses a large power button, and only a few extra hotkeys sit above the number pad.</p>\n<p>Sporting large, soft-touch keys, the keyboard is comfortable to use. The keys, however, are a little slippery, which you’ll notice if you type quickly, and they provide weak tactile feedback. The touchpad is not quite as responsive as I’d like, but the mouse buttons are easy to press.</p>\n<p>The keyboard is backlit, and Alienware provides a ten-zone lighting system you can customize with a software utility. Gamers will appreciate the four lighting zones dedicated to the keyboard and number pad (three for the former and one for the latter). The zone covering the touchpad, which lights up each time you touch it, is particularly fun, if a little distracting.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0067-0126/93641-1-eng-GB/f0067-012.jpg\" width=\"614\" height=\"531\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0067-01\" title=\"f0067-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>The Alienware 17’s</b> battery life doesn’t exactly impress, but the machine should deliver an entire movie without its power brick.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div>\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0068-0130/93634-1-eng-GB/f0068-012.jpg\" width=\"863\" height=\"387\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0068-01\" title=\"f0068-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>Don’t expect</b> to travel light.

The bright antiglare screen presents crisp and accurate colors, and off-axis viewing angles look great. My only complaint is that the display appears a bit pixelated, especially if you’re used to smaller, higher-resolution screens. If you use this laptop primarily for work, you’ll notice this effect more than if you use it only to play games. HD video plays back nicely, with deep blacks and just a little artifacting in fast-paced scenes.</p>\n<p>As for audio capabilities, the speakers produce fairly full, bassinundated sound. They’re better than the average set of laptop speakers, but I’ve definitely heard superior sound on other desktop replacements of a similar size. The Alienware 17 has a headphone jack, a microphone jack, and a combination headphone/microphone jack, which is good news for gamers with headsets.</p>\n<p>The Alienware 17 is attractive, fast, and specced to the max. It’s the best laptop performer we’ve tested so far, and it’s lightweight for a machine in this category.

What it won’t let you do is back up a client to the My Cloud Mirror itself over an Internet connection; you have to attach the client to the same local network as the My Cloud Mirror.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0071-0125/93712-1-eng-GB/f0071-012.jpg\" width=\"730\" height=\"411\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0071-01\" title=\"f0071-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>The My Cloud Mirror’s</b> user interface is well laid out and easy to understand.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>Unlike a Dropbox account, which maintains a folder on your local device that is synchronized with your cloud storage, files are stored only on the My Cloud device.

It wasn’t terrible at dealing with very large files (we test read and write performance with a single 10GB file), but it was considerably slower reading and writing our 10GB collection of files. And that will likely be the more common real-world usage scenario.</p>\n<p>If you think you’d benefit from the additional features that the My Cloud EX2 has to offer (dual ethernet, dual powersupply inputs, and 10 licenses for WD’s SmartWare Pro), that box is street-priced just $18 higher than the My Cloud Mirror.</p>\n<p>The original My Cloud is a very good—if a bit slow—consumer-oriented NAS box, and the My Cloud Mirror adds a valuable feature in RAID 1.

connected-home product line, the D-Link DIR-880L <a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/dir880l\" target=\"_self\">(go.pcworld.com/dir880l)</a> is the 802.11ac Wi-Fi router to buy. It’s also a good choice if you’re merely seeking a new router that’s easy to set up and manage, with or without a PC.</p>\n<p>It’s priced about $30 less than either the Asus RT-AC68U or the Linksys WRT1900AC. Like both of those routers, this is a dual-band model that supports 802.11b/g/n clients on its 2.4GHz frequency band (802.11n clients at speeds up to 600 megabits per second) and 802.11a/ac clients on its 5GHz band (802.11ac clients at speeds up to 1300 mbps). Add 600 to 1300, and you get the oh-so-popular AC1900 marketing label, which D-Link applies to this model. You can set up a guest network on either or both bands.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0075-0123/93769-1-eng-GB/f0075-012.jpg\" width=\"730\" height=\"467\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0075-01\" title=\"f0075-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>The Mydlink</b> portal lets you manage the DIR-880L via the cloud.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p class=\"pullQuote\">If you don’t like this router’s desktop footprint, you can hang it on the wall.</p>\n<p>The low-profile enclosure sports three oversize antennas that you can remove and upgrade. LEDs on top indicate the status of the router’s power, Internet connection, 2.4GHz and 5GHz wireless networks, and USB ports. A USB 3.0 port resides on the left, and a USB 2.0 port, a power button, a WAN port, and the usual four-port gigabit ethernet switch sit in the back. If you don’t like this router’s desktop footprint, you can hang it on the wall.</p>\n<p>The firmware provides basic, consumer-oriented features, including beamforming, VPN support using L2TP over IPSec, and a Quality of Service engine that prioritizes lag-sensitive traffic such as online games, VoIP calls, and video streaming. You can also manually assign higher priority to individual clients.</p>\n<p>You’ll find support for advanced configurations such as port forwarding and assigning clients to static routes, but the DIR-880L limits you to 15 instances in each case. Parental controls are even more restricted: You can set schedules for when individual clients—or the router itself—are allowed online, or you can block websites.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0076-0126/93762-1-eng-GB/f0076-012.jpg\" width=\"633\" height=\"684\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0076-01\" title=\"f0076-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>D-Link’s router</b> trailed pricier rivals in our tests using an Asus USB-AC56 adapter.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>The DIR-880L is easy to set up in a Web browser. If you’d prefer to use a tablet or smartphone, D-Link’s QRS Mobile app is available for Android and iOS. The router comes preconfigured with a password to guard its wireless networks. The admin user interface is not password protected, but fortunately the setup wizard prompts you to create a password for that purpose. Register for D-Link’s free Mydlink service, and you can access and manage this router from the cloud.</p>\n<p>The router’s USB ports can share a printer, a scanner, or a storage device (any combination of two) over your network. I didn’t evaluate the router’s performance on that score. The DIR-880L is DLNA compatible, but it doesn’t have an iTunes server.</p>\n<p>In performance tests, the DIR-880L was much slower on the 2.4GHz frequency band than the Asus and Linksys routers at close range (with an 802.11n client in the same room as the router, separated by 9 feet). It was slightly faster than the Linksys model, however, when the client was in my kitchen (20 feet from the router, separated by one wall with plywood cabinets). And it was much faster on this band than both competing routers when I tested it in my home theater (client 35 feet from the router) and my home office (client 65 feet from the router).</p>\n<p>D-Link’s router trailed both the Asus and the Linksys with an 802.11ac client (for the test, I plugged an Asus USB-AC56 Wi-Fi adapter into the client’s USB port) in three of my four test locations. TCP throughput of 328 megabits per second at close range is nothing to sneeze at, but the WRT1900AC delivered 439 mbps here and the Asus managed 418 mbps. The DIR-880L will probably stream high-definition video to most rooms in the typical home, but it wasn’t nearly as fast as the competition on this band in my longer-distance tests.</p>\n<p>I’ve found that the best way to get maximum performance from an 802.11ac router is to deploy two of them: one as a Wi-Fi router and the other as a Wi-Fi bridge that you hardwire to one or more clients. You can configure a second DIR-880L as a bridge, but I couldn’t test the product’s performance in such a scenario because D-Link sent only one router.</p>\n<p>The D-Link DIR-880L doesn’t deliver state-of-the-art performance, but it isn’t slow. Although this router won’t excite router geeks, it isn’t a bad choice for mainstream users.</p>\n<p class=\"pullQuote\">The DIR-880L will probably stream HD video to most rooms in the typical

Dining tables are too high, coffee tables are too low, and lap desks are too small and unstable. If you spend a lot of time on your laptop, those poor ergonomics invite a host of back problems, repetitive strain injuries, and other maladies.</p>\n<p>Set up Coalesse’s Free Stand (<a href=\"http://www.coalesse.com\" target=\"_self\">www.coalesse.com</a>) in front of just about any chair, and you have a work-friendly environment that will keep you productive and healthy. And when the factory whistle blows at the end of the day, you can fold the Free Stand flat and slide it under your sofa or easy chair to rid yourself of the irksome visual reminder that you have to work for a living.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0080-0128/93819-1-eng-GB/f0080-012.jpg\" width=\"322\" height=\"226\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0080-01\" title=\"f0080-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>The Free Stand</b> has robust hinges and superb fit and finish.</p>\n <span class=\"credit\">\nPHOTOGRAPHY BY MICHAEL BROWN</span></figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>The Free Stand is well made, with a stand fabricated from extruded aluminum painted with a durable powder-coat finish. A pair of 22-inch-long feet give it stability, and an 18-inch-wide opening between them accommodates your feet. The work surface rotates a full 360 degrees, so you can also orient the base sideways to your lap. You can lower it to 20 inches and raise it as high as 27 inches, so you should be able to find the ideal height whether you’re sitting at a dining room table, on a sofa, or in a beanbag chair. It’s too short to function as a standing workstation, though.</p>\n<p>The work surface measures just over 19 inches wide by 11 inches deep—roomy enough to accommodate a 14-inch laptop, but I had to slide the computer to the left a wee bit to make room for a mouse. According to Coalesse, you can wipe away spills from the rigid ABS plastic surface using typical household cleaning products, such as Windex or Formula 409, but avoid bleach-based products and hand sanitizers as they can discolor or damage the nonslip painted finish.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0081-0129/93812-1-eng-GB/f0081-012.jpg\" width=\"731\" height=\"393\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0081-01\" title=\"f0081-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>When collapsed,</b> the Free Stand is just 5 inches tall.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>The Free Stand has one handle and three control mechanisms. To fold it flat, lower the work surface by pushing a button at the top of its pillar. Pull a lever underneath the work surface to drop it to a right angle to the pillar (it will lock in that position). Push a second button at the bottom of the pillar to fold the stand flat. Repeat the same three steps in reverse to set it up again. The Free Stand’s smooth feet glide over hard-surfaced floors and carpets with equal ease.</p>\n<h3><b>Pricey but nice</b></h3><p>The Free Stand weighs 11 pounds, and the handle makes it easy to carry from one room to another, although it’s a tad too hefty for travel.</p>\n<p>I like everything about the Free Stand except its $399 price tag. You could probably find a laptop stand at Ikea for a fraction of that price, but not with the same high-quality construction, and it probably wouldn’t fold up. The Free Stand is built to last, you can stash it anywhere, and it’s a joy to use.</p>\n<h3><b>Coalesse Free Stand</b></h3><p><b>PROS:</b></p>\n<p>• Sturdy and built to last</p>\n<p>• Folds to 5

clumps of dust weigh down your PC, making it slow down over time. Give your PC’s software and hardware a quick tune-up, and it should run just as it did the day you bought it. Inexpensive hardware upgrades can even make it faster than it was brand-new (go.pcworld.com/hwup).</p>\n<h3><b>Software tune-ups</b></h3><h4><b>1. Disable or remove unwanted startup programs</b></h4><p>Many programs install system tray utilities or services that piggyback on your system’s startup routine, slowing boot time and wasting RAM.</p>\n<p>In Windows 8, right-click your taskbar, select Task Manager, click More details, and, in the Startup tab, disable programs you don’t need.</p>\n<p>In Windows 7, use the Startup Manager in CCleaner to change which programs start up when the system boots <a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/cclean\" target=\"_self\">(go.pcworld.com/cclean)</a>. In CCleaner, navigate to Tools &gt; Startup.</p>\n<h4><b>2. Clean up unnecessary system files</b></h4><p>Use a tool such as CCleaner or Disk Cleanup <a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/diskclean\" target=\"_self\">(go.pcworld.com/diskclean)</a>, included in Windows, to clear out system files you don’t need.

Type Disk Cleanup, and click the <i>Free up disk space by deleting unnecessary</i>files shortcut in Windows 8 or the Disk Cleanup shortcut in Windows 7.</p>\n<p>CCleaner can clean up even more types of temporary files.

Defragment and optimize your hard drives</b></h4><p>Modern versions of Windows defragment drives in the background, so it’s probably not necessary to do so manually <a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/defragging\" target=\"_self\">(go. pcworld.com/defragging)</a>. Still, it doesn’t hurt.</p>\n<p>Tap the &lt;Windows&gt; key to open the Start menu or Start screen, type Defragment, and launch Disk Defragmenter in Windows 7 or the Defragment and optimize your drives tool in Windows 8. The tool will analyze your drives and determine whether you need to defragment them. Note that Windows 7’s Disk Defragmenter should refuse to defragment solid-state drives, while Windows 8 has renamed Disk Defragmenter “Optimize Drives” because it can also optimize solid-state drives <a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/defragssd\" target=\"_self\">(go.pcworld.com/defragssd)</a>.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0122-0110/94152-1-eng-GB/f0122-012.jpg\" width=\"379\" height=\"443\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0122-01\" title=\"f0122-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>The Windows 7</b> Disk Cleanup utility can free up space.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h4><b>4. Keep your system free of viruses and malware</b></h4><p>Even if you’re using antivirus software and otherwise playing it safe, new breeds of malware can sneak onto your system. The nuclear option is to reinstall Windows entirely. On Windows 8, you can use the Refresh feature <a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/fresh\" target=\"_self\">(go.pcworld.com/fresh)</a>, which retains your personal files, but gives you a fresh desktop system. You’ll have to reinstall your desktop software.</p>\n<p>On Windows 7, you can use your manufacturer’s recovery partition <a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/partition\" target=\"_self\">(go.pcworld.com/partition)</a> or reinstall Windows 7 from an installation disc. Whichever path you take, you’ll need to clean up bloatware afterward <a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/bloatware\" target=\"_self\">(go.pcworld.com/bloatware)</a>.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0123-0111/94145-1-eng-GB/f0123-012.jpg\" width=\"731\" height=\"358\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0123-01\" title=\"f0123-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>The Windows 8</b> Refresh PC utility reinstalls Windows 8 and wipes out all program files, but leaves your personal files intact.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h4><b>5. Upgrade to a newer operating system</b></h4><p>If you have an old Windows XP PC, you can try installing a lightweight Linux system on it to give it a new lease on life <a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/linuxalt\" target=\"_self\">(go.pcworld.com/linuxalt)</a>.</p>\n<p>You can speed up an old computer that came with Windows Vista by updating it to Windows 8.1 or even Windows 7, but you’re probably better off putting the money for a new Windows license toward newer, faster hardware.</p>\n<h4><b>Hardware cleaning</b></h4><p>If your PC can’t cool itself efficiently, it may throttle down your CPU or graphics hardware. Excessive heat can damage hardware over time or cause it to unexpectedly shut down. When you hear the internal fans whirring at maximum speed during light or moderate usage, your system may be overheating.</p>\n<h4><b>1. Bust the dust</b></h4><p>Give your PC’s case a regular cleaning to prevent dust buildup <a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/bustdust\" target=\"_self\">(go. pcworld.com/bustdust)</a>. With the computer powered off and unplugged, open its case and spray with canned air to clean out the dust clinging to fans and vents. You can try cleaning out your laptop’s cooling fans <a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/fanclean\" target=\"_self\">go.pcworld.com/fanclean)</a>, but opening up a laptop tends to be more difficult.</p>\n<h4><b>2. Replace the paste</b></h4><p>A heat-dissipating thermal compound sits between both your CPU and GPU and their respective heatsinks, conducting heat from the heatgenerating chip to the fan-cooled heatsink. This paste deteriorates over time, but you can replace it. Apply a thin, flat, uniform layer</p>\n<h3><b>Hardware upgrades</b></h3><p>If your PC is a decade old, you won’t be able to speed it up much with hardware upgrades—and in that case you’d be better off buying a new PC. Keeping that in mind, the following upgrades offer the most bang for your buck <a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/buck\" target=\"_self\">(go.pcworld.com/buck)</a>.</p>\n<h4><b>1. Replace the drives</b></h4><p>The hard disk is typically the major bottleneck in a PC. Solid-state drives are much faster than traditional magnetic hard drives, although they offer less storage space per dollar <a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/ssdspeed\" target=\"_self\">(go.pcworld.com/ssdspeed)</a>. You can get a 120GB SSD for $100, and a 2TB magnetic hard drive for about the same price.</p>\n<p>If your PC is only a few years old, you can probably boost its speed with an SSD. You may even be able to upgrade your laptop with an SSD <a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/laptopssd\" target=\"_self\">(go.pcworld.com/laptopssd.)</a></p>\n<h4><b>2. Upgrade random access memory (RAM)</b></h4><p>The RAM holds your PC’s working memory. If it has too little RAM, your PC has to constantly read and write to its hard drive, slowing everything down.</p>\n<p>To install RAM, power off the PC, open it up, and snap in the new sticks <a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/pcram\" target=\"_self\">(go.pcworld.com/pcram)</a>. Some laptops allow easy access to their RAM slots <a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/laptopram\" target=\"_self\">(go.pcworld.com/laptopram)</a>. Make sure you buy the correct type of RAM for your PC.</p>\n<h4><b>3. Upgrade the CPU or graphics card</b></h4><p>If you’re an avid gamer, you may want to upgrade your PC’s graphics card <a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/gupgrade\" target=\"_self\">(go.pcworld.com/gupgrade)</a>. Bear in mind that the performance bottleneck might actually be the CPU: If it isn’t fast enough, upgrading the graphics card won’t help much.</p>\n<p>CPU upgrades are possible <a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/cupgrade\" target=\"_self\">(go.pcworld.com/cupgrade)</a>, but Intel regularly introduces new socket formats, which means new CPUs may not fit in older motherboards. An Intel CPU won’t work in a motherboard with an AMD CPU socket, and vice versa. If you need to upgrade the motherboard as well, you may want to consider investing in a new computer <a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/newpc\" target=\"_self\">(go.pcworld.com/newpc)</a>.</p>\n","layout":{},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":0,"link_source":"","competition":[],"flatplan_title":"","notes":"","gutter_credit":"","other":"","image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1440189061.1438","name":"f0120-01","source":"ILLUSTRATION
