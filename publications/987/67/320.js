It’s just that the chipsets capable of delivering all the features and performance of 802.11ac are still in development.</p>\n<p>The truth is, most of the first 802.11ac routers on the market were based on draft versions of the 802.11ac standard. Although some newer Wave 1 models, such as Netgear’s six-antenna Nighthawk X6, are implementing a few cool tricks to squeeze more performance from that technology, a second wave of 802.11ac routers will hit store shelves in early 2015. Those devices will support optional features that will deliver even higher wireless performance. Around the same time, new and complementary wireless standards made for specialized applications will also appear.</p>\n<p>In the end, there’s no point in trying to cheat obsolescence by putting off your next router purchase, because the industry is already hard at work developing the successor to 802.11ac.</p>\n<p class=\"pullQuote\"><b>The second wave of 802.11ac routers will deliver even higher wireless performance.</b></p>\n<h3><b>The two-party system</b></h3><p>The IEEE defines Wi-Fi standards such as 802.11ac and the older 802.11n. The Wi-Fi Alliance (an association of companies that build wireless-networking devices) certifies that the hardware based on those standards will work together.</p>\n<p>Wi-Fi Alliance certification is not a requirement—hardware manufacturers pay for the designation—but it can be reassuring to consumers, especially in the early days of a new standard. The promise that hardware will work as expected is important because the IEEE can take years to finalize standards; for example, it started working on 802.11ac in 2008 and finished in late 2013. Equipment makers often don’t want to wait, so as soon as the ink dries on an early draft, they market new products based on that draft standard. Buffalo shipped out the first 802.11ac router in 2012, but the Wi-Fi Alliance didn’t launch its first 802.11ac certification program until the middle of 2013.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0085-0130/93883-1-eng-GB/f0085-012.jpg\" width=\"193\" height=\"57\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0085-01\" title=\"f0085-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div>\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0085-029/93876-1-eng-GB/f0085-022.jpg\" width=\"164\" height=\"131\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0085-02\" title=\"f0085-02\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>What’s so special about 802.11ac? For starters, it operates on the 5GHz frequency band, which is less crowded than the 2.4GHz band; as a result, its signal is less susceptible to interference.</p>\n<p>In addition, its performance significantly exceeds that of the previous standard. SU-MIMO (single-user multiple-input/multiple-output) technology, one of the hallmarks of the older 802.11n standard, allows the transmission of multiple spatial streams to a single client. This technology carries over to 802.11ac, which adds a morepowerful modulation technique (among other things) to produce an impressive maximum physical link rate of 433 megabits per second per spatial stream.</p>\n<h3>New technology brings faster connections</h3>\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0086-0129/93869-1-eng-GB/f0086-012.jpg\" width=\"275\" height=\"317\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0086-01\" title=\"f0086-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>Single-user MIMO</b></p>\n<p>Serves one device at a time.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div>\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0086-026/93862-1-eng-GB/f0086-022.jpg\" width=\"271\" height=\"317\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0086-02\" title=\"f0086-02\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>Multi-user MIMO</b></p>\n<p>Multi-user beamforming serves multiple devices simultaneously.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><p>Because a Wave 1 802.11ac router can support up to three streams simultaneously, it can send and receive data at a top physical link rate of 1.3 gigabits per second. Compare that with an 802.11n router, which provides up to three spatial streams with a maximum physical link rate of 150 mbps each (for aggregate throughput of 450 mbps).</p>\n<p>In April, Quantenna Communications announced its first Wave 2 802.11ac chipset <a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/quantenna\" target=\"_self\">(go.pcworld.com/quantenna)</a>. The second wave of 802.11ac routers is slated to arrive sometime next year. These router models will take advantage of optional elements of the 802.11ac standard.

(Wave 1 802.11ac routers can bond 5GHz channels, but the resulting channel is only 80MHz wide.) Third, whereas 802.11n and Wave 1 802.11ac routers support a maximum of three spatial streams, Wave 2 802.11ac routers can support as many as eight spatial streams.</p>\n<p>Using wider channels or additional spatial streams (not enough bandwidth is available to do both), improved beamforming <a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/beamform\" target=\"_self\">(go.pcworld.com/beamform)</a>, and other techniques, Wave 2 802.11ac routers will deliver maximum physical link rates in the range of 7 to 10 gbps.</p>\n<h3><b>The next new Wi-Fi:IEEE 802.11ax</b></h3><p>In a recent briefing, Greg Ennis, the Wi-Fi Alliance’s vice president of technology, said the IEEE anticipates that the successor to 802.11ac will be 802.11ax. Although the standards body doesn’t expect to ratify 802.11ax before March 2019, products based on a draft could reach the market as early as 2016—just as we saw draft-802.11n and draft-802.11ac products before those standards received official ratification.</p>\n<p>One of the top objectives of 802.11ax, according to Ennis, is to quadruple speed to individual network clients—not just to increase the speed of the network overall. Chinese manufacturer Huawei, which has engineers in the IEEE 802.11ax working group, has already reported Wi-Fi connection speeds up to 10.53 gbps on the 5GHz band.</p>\n<p>Ennis said the 802.11ax standard will improve Wi-Fi speed and reliability in environments with high numbers of users, such as hotspots in public venues, by employing the available spectrum more efficiently, doing a better job of managing interference, and enhancing underlying protocols such as MAC (medium access control) data communication.</p>\n<p class=\"pullQuote\">Products based on a draft of the 802.11ax standard could reach the market as early as 2016.</p>\n<p>The 802.11ax standard will also use OFDMA (orthogonal frequency-division multiple access) to boost the amount of data a router can transmit. Like OFDM (orthogonal frequencydivision multiplexing), OFDMA encodes data on multiple subcarrier frequencies, essentially packing more data into the same amount of air space. The “multiple access” portion of the OFDMA name describes a means of assigning subsets of those subcarrier frequencies to individual users.</p>\n<h3><b>Complementary standards</b></h3><p>While one segment of the IEEE is working to define the successor to 802.11ac, other factions are developing two complementary wireless-networking standards that address particular needs.</p>\n<p>First, the IEEE 802.11ad <a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/80211ad\" target=\"_self\">(go. pcworld.com/80211ad)</a> standard employs unlicensed spectrum in the 60GHz frequency band to build fast short-range wireless networks with peak transmission rates of around 7 gbps.</p>\n<p class=\"pullQuote\">The few 60GHz products to reach the market are designed to operate at very short range.</p>\n<p>Transmitting data at 60GHz has two major drawbacks: The extremely short waves have difficulty penetrating walls, and oxygen molecules begin to absorb electromagnetic energy at 60GHz. That explains why the relatively few 60GHz products to reach the market so far are designed to operate at very short range, or just within a single room. The Dell Wireless Dock D5000 <a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/dockd5000\" target=\"_self\">(go.pcworld.com/dockd5000)</a> is a good example of the former, and the DVDO Air <a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/dvdoair\" target=\"_self\">(go.pcworld.com/dvdoair)</a>, which streams HD video and audio from a Blu-ray player to a video projector without a cable, is a great example of the latter.</p>\n<p>In late 2013 the Wi-Fi Alliance announced its 802.11ad certification brand: The group will stamp interoperable 802.11ad products as “WiGig Certified”<a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/wigig\" target=\"_self\">(go.pcworld.com/wigig)</a> when the certification program begins in 2015.</p>\n<p>The IEEE 802.11ah standard, meanwhile, resides at the opposite end of the spectrum. Operating in the unlicensed 900MHz frequency band, a wireless network based on 802.11ah would easily penetrate walls, but it wouldn’t deliver much bandwidth—only 100 kbps to 40 mbps. Such technology might be useful for sensors and probes in connected homes or commercial buildings; 802.11ah could be considered a competitor to the Z-Wave and ZigBee protocols in the “Internet of Things” arena, too. The IEEE isn’t expected to ratify this standard until January 2016.</p>\n<p class=\"pullQuote\">Operating in the 900MHz band, a network based on 802.11ah would easily penetrate walls.</p>\n<h3><b>Wi-Fi for every need</b></h3><p>Look past all the alphabet soup, and you’ll see that the future of Wi-Fi centers on the evolution of standards that can meet the demands of new generations of wirelessly connected devices. When those new generations include everything from enterprise printers to egg timers, you can bet we’ll need all of the flavors of Wi-Fi that are coming down the pike.</p>\n","layout":{},"relative_links":[],"schedule":"","paywall_availability":0,"link_source":"","competition":[],"flatplan_title":"","notes":"","gutter_credit":"","other":"","image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1440189039.6301","name":"f0083-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0083-0128/93897-1-eng-GB/f0083-012.jpg?t=default_ipad_portrait&ext/f0083-012_default_ipad_portrait.jpg","portrait":true,"width":"726","height":"1024","legacy_id":"9523","is_default":true},{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_0_1440189039.6301","name":"f0083-01","source":"","caption":"","media_annotations":"","media_creator":"","media_usage_license":"","image_url":"http://cdn-assets.ziniopro.com/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0083-0128/93897-1-eng-GB/f0083-012.jpg?t=default_ipad_landscape&ext/f0083-012_default_ipad_landscape.jpg","portrait":false,"width":"544","height":"768","legacy_id":"9523","is_default":false}],"related_objects":{"image":[{"id":"zinio_100340926_image_6_1440189035.6289","name":"f0087-01","source":"PHOTOGRAPHY

have made clear that the company is going head-to-head with Microsoft on productivity services. Unfortunately, in its efforts to emulate the industry standard, Google has made its cloudbased apps every bit as Byzantine as Office 365.</p>\n<p>Google’s services overlap and their names aren’t self-explanatory. This problem is aggravated by the company’s propensity to change those names, consolidate services under one moniker, or simply discontinue them.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, underneath the confusing nomenclature you’ll find that Google is currently offering three major productivity services to the public. (Though the company’s master list of products includes dozens of additional offerings, this story doesn’t focus on non-productivityrelated business services like Google AdWords, Google Analytics, Google Payments, and so on.) Here’s an analysis of each to help you decide whether one (or more) is right for you.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0095-0114/93968-1-eng-GB/f0095-012.jpg\" width=\"397\" height=\"493\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0095-01\" title=\"f0095-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>GOOGLE DRIVE</b></h3><p>Google Drive is an individuallevel tool and probably the best-known of these services. At its heart it’s an online storage system for everyone.</p>\n<p>You can store most anything on Google Drive (plug-ins let you work directly on Google Drive through Windows and other operating systems), but the real productivity benefit comes when you use Google’s business apps, which are integrated directly into Google Drive. These apps include standard business tools: a word processor (Google Docs), a spreadsheet (Google Sheets), and a presentation tool (Google Slides). You can create documents with these tools from within Google Drive. You can also upload documents from a device, convert them to the relevant Google format, and continue to edit them online.</p>\n<h3><b>Naming confusion</b></h3><p>You can store just about anything on Google Drive (plug-ins let you work directly on Google Drive through Windows and other operating systems), but the real productivity benefit comes when you use Google’s business apps, which are integrated directly into Google Drive. Primarily, this set of apps includes the trinity of standard business tools: a word processor (Google Docs), a spreadsheet (Google Sheets), and a presentation tool (Google Slides). You can create documents with these tools directly from within Google Drive. You can also upload documents from a device, convert them to the relevant Google format, and continue to edit them online.</p>\n<p>Google Drive competes with Microsoft OneDrive <a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/aboutonedrive\" target=\"_self\">(go. pcworld.com/aboutonedrive)</a>, which also lets you store all manner of files, as well as create and edit files, for free. OneDrive gives you 15GB of space for signing up.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0096-0132/93961-1-eng-GB/f0096-012.jpg\" width=\"755\" height=\"615\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0096-01\" title=\"f0096-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>Google Drive</b> by any other name...</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>GOOGLE APPS FOR BUSINESS</b></h3><p>The name Google Apps for Business implies that there is a Google Apps Not for Business, but other than offerings for Education and Government, this isn’t the case.</p>\n<p>Part of the confusion stems from a prior product called Google Apps Standard, a free and strippeddown version of Google Apps for Business. Google discontinued this in 2012 because, it said, users outgrew the service too quickly.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0097-0116/93954-1-eng-GB/f0097-012.jpg\" width=\"442\" height=\"603\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0097-01\" title=\"f0097-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>Emphasis on groups</b></h3><p>Google Apps for Business comprises a sprawling set of services (customized for use in groups) that includes everything described above under Google Drive, plus some additional features. Most notable among them is the ability to set up your own email system (with your own domain), shared calendars, and video meetings and presentations via Google Hangouts. Many companies that adopt Google Apps for Business use it heavily for the email features, while the ability to collaborate on document creation and editing is almost an afterthought.</p>\n<p>Subscribers can manage Google Apps for Business through a central tool, called Google Admin, where you add and delete approved users and devices and perform other basic maintenance chores.</p>\n<p>Google Apps for Business is pretty inexpensive: $5 per user per month, or $50 per user per year. Google Apps for Business users get 30GB of total storage space each, double the free Google Drive limit, but if that’s not enough, there’s now…</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0098-0114/93947-1-eng-GB/f0098-012.jpg\" width=\"744\" height=\"475\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0098-01\" title=\"f0098-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>Google Apps</b> for Business customizes Google’s productivity tools for groups.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>GOOGLE DRIVE FOR WORK</b></h3><p>The latest addition to the Google Drive/Apps family is Google Drive for Work, which mostly amounts to an expansion of storage space for customers of Google Apps for Business.</p>\n<p>The heart of this offering is unlimited storage. For $10 per user per month (or $100 per user per year), Google lifts the 30GB per user cap. For companies with five or more paid users, there are no limits on the amount of storage space each user can occupy, but if you have fewer than five, the cap remains at a spacious 1TB per user.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0099-0115/93940-1-eng-GB/f0099-012.jpg\" width=\"653\" height=\"501\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0099-01\" title=\"f0099-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div>\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n                                                                                                                                            <img src=\"/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0100-0116/93933-1-eng-GB/f0100-012.jpg\" width=\"755\" height=\"429\"  style=\"border: 0px  ;\" alt=\"f0100-01\" title=\"f0100-01\" />\n        \t\t<figcaption style=\"display:none\">\n<p><b>Google Drive for Work</b> has already been renamed as Google Apps Unlimited.</p>\n</figcaption>\n    \n    \n    \n    </div><h3><b>Enhanced security</b></h3><p>Google Drive for Work is being folded directly into Google Apps for Business as a premium option, so don’t be surprised if the name doesn’t stick around. In fact, just a week after launch the service already had an alternate name—Google Apps Unlimited <a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/gaunlimited\" target=\"_self\">(go.pcworld.com/gaunlimited)</a>. You don’t need to sign up for a separate service if you want to use it; it’s available as an option on the Google Apps for Business pricing page <a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/gabprice\" target=\"_self\">&quot;go.pcworld.com/gabprice)</a> during signup. (Existing Google Apps for Business users can also upgrade to the new plan.)</p>\n<p>In addition to the expanded storage feature, Google Drive for Work also adds improved security and manageability, such as the power to decide whether users can install the Google Drive Windows client on an individual basis. Google Drive for Work also includes a component called Google Vault <a href=\"http://go.pcworld.com/vault\" target=\"_self\">(go.pcworld.com/vault)</a>—aka Google Apps Vault—which lets you archive your company’s email and Web chat content for the amount of time that you set. This alone could be essential for certain businesses where data retention rules must be followed.</p>\n<h3><b>GOING FORWARD</b></h3><p>Once you get a handle on Google’s erratic naming scheme, understanding the differences among these offerings ultimately isn’t too tough. One thing’s for sure, though: This will all change again, and sooner than we all think.</p>\n\n<div class=\"\">\t\t\n\n    \n        \n    \n
