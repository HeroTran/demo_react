<p><b>In its letter</b> to regulators, Google expresses its concerns about the ruling.</p>
</figcaption>
    
    
    
    </div><p><b>SOME OF THOSE</b> people seeking to scrub their histories from the Web under Europe’s recently implemented “right to be forgotten” rule are being economical with the truth when making their requests, Google says.</p>
<p>In a July 31 letter to European data regulators <a href="http://go.pcworld.com/forgotten" target="_self">(go.pcworld.com/</a> forgotten), Google lists some of the challenges it faces in complying with the ruling, which allows individuals to compel search engines such as Google and Bing to remove links to pages that mention their name if the references are “inadequate,” “irrelevant,” or “excessive.”</p>
<h3><b>Unreliable information</b></h3><p>Part of the problem is that in deciding whether to grant or reject a request, Google must often rely on information the requester submits.</p>
<p>“Some requests turn out to have been made with false and inaccurate information,” Google says in the letter. “Even if requesters provide us with accurate information, they understandably may avoid presenting facts that are not in their favour.”</p>
<p>For example, the company says, someone might ask to remove an old article about crimes they committed as a teenager—without revealing that they had been convicted of similar crimes as an adult. Consequently, Google might not be aware of information that would support leaving the search result intact.</p>
<p>Google has criticized the ruling in the past but says that it’s working to comply with the law nonetheless. Its late-July letter was in response to a questionnaire from regulators seeking more details about how it handles the requests.</p>
<h3><b>Thousands of requests</b></h3><p>As of July 18, Google had received more than 91,000 requests involving more than 328,000 URLs. In the July 31 letter, the company acknowledges removing around 53 percent of those URLs, declining to remove about a third of them, and requesting more information in 15 percent of cases. It goes on to say that those percentages could shift over time.</p>

<p><b>The ruling</b> makes specific demands on search engine operators.</p>
</figcaption>
    
    
    
    </div><p>Reasons Google might not grant a request include situations in which removing the link would not be in the public interest, or if the contents of a link involve political speech, it says.</p>
<p>As of the July 31 letter, people in France and Germany had submitted the most requests, at 17,500 and 16,500, respectively, followed by the United Kingdom with 12,000 requests, Spain with 8000, Italy with 7500, and Holland with 5500.</p>
<p>Some webmasters have complained to Google about the removal of links to their sites, the company says.</p>
<p>Other parties besides Google have criticized the ruling. In late July a UK House of Lords subcommittee said the ruling was unworkable and misguided, and that it could be particularly damaging for smaller search engines that don’t have the resources to handle such requests.</p>
<p>Google provides a form online for removal requests. So does Microsoft’s Bing. “We continue to work out the details of the process we’ll use to evaluate the requests,” a Microsoft spokesperson says.</p>
