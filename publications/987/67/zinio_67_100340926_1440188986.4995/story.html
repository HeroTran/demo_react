<p><b>IN LATE JULY,</b> Microsoft updated its three Office for iPad apps—Word, Excel, and PowerPoint—with new features, including PDF export, presentation views, and a new flick gesture.</p>
<p>The three apps are now upgraded to version 1.1 in the Apple App Store. Microsoft announced Office for iPad in March, and the elegant port of the office suite has so far received (mostly) glowing reviews. “Millions” of users have downloaded the apps, according to a blog post <a href="http://go.pcworld.com/offipadblog" target="_self">(go.pcworld.com/offipadblog)</a> by Microsoft’s Office team.</p>

<p><b>Improvements</b> to PivotTables are a notable addition to Excel for iPad.</p>

    </div><p>While Excel and PowerPoint each received their own unique updates, all three apps gained several common features, including the frequently requested ability to export documents as PDF files. In addition, you can manually crop photos and images in all three apps using a new crop tool that allows you to choose from a list of popular preset sizes or to create your own. (A reset button is included too.) Finally, Office for iPad now has the ability to import external fonts.</p>
<h3><b>Excel: External keyboards enter the picture</b></h3><p>As any data-entry specialist knows, an external keyboard can be essential to the task of crunching numbers. The new update adds support for such keyboards to the Excel app.</p>
<p>In addition, Excel can now interact with PivotTables that have source data in the same workbook, and it also boasts improved print options. The spreadsheet program has gained one nifty little gesture, too: When you “flick” from a cell containing data, you select all of the cells along that row or column, out through the next open cell. With this gesture available, you no longer have to pick and choose cells, or to navigate menu options.</p>
<h3><b>PowerPoint: Presentation Mode debuts</b></h3><p>The most dramatic update to the PowerPoint app is the addition of Presentation Mode, which allows you to view your notes on your tablet while projecting the formal presentation on another screen. (Google’s competing Chromebox for Meetings, coincidentally, added a similar feature the same week.) You can now enhance your presentations with background music or video. And according to Microsoft, the PowerPoint app’s new eraser and pen settings make annotations even easier.</p>
<p>Microsoft has said previously that it’s busy putting its services on as many platforms as possible. The updates to Office for iPad certainly help that cause.</p>
