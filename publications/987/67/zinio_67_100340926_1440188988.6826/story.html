<p><b>The new law</b> gives you the freedom to move your device to another carrier.</p>

    </div><p><b>ON AUGUST 1,</b> President Barack Obama signed into law <a href="http://go.pcworld.com/whunlock" target="_self">(go.pcworld.com/whunlock)</a> a bill that allows U.S. citizens to unlock their phones. That means you can take your mobile device, no matter which carrier subsidized it, and move it to a competing carrier.</p>
<p>In late July the U.S. House of Representatives passed the bipartisan bill, after approval by the Senate. Unlocking phones had become illegal in January 2013, when an exemption to the DMCA expired.</p>
<p>There is a bit of a catch, however: The Unlocking Consumer Choice and Wireless Competition Act, as it’s called, is valid only through 2015. For now, it ensures that you have a choice in matters regarding your mobile device, as long as your phone is compatible with another carrier’s network and you’ve complied with your previous contract. And if you don’t fancy yourself as technologically savvy, the bill allows you to seek outside help.</p>
<p>It has been a long journey to get to this point. About a year ago, the National Telecommunications and Information Administration filed a petition <a href="http://go.pcworld.com/ntiafcc" target="_self">(go pcworld.com/ntiafcc)</a> urging the Federal Communications Commission to make a ruling that would require carriers to unlock phones and tablets at the customer’s request. Although most carriers have been kind about unlocking devices, tools for consumers to unlock their own phones and tablets were illegal.</p>
<p>What are you waiting for? Go forth and be free! At least until this exemption expires, anyway.</p>
