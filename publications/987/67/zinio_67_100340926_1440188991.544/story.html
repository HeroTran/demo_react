    </div><p><b>MORE THAN TWO</b> and a half months after the Surface Pro 3’s debut, all of its variants are finally available: Following the June 20 launch of the Core i5 versions, on August 1 the Core i3 and Core i7 editions of Microsoft’s new laptop-replacing tablet hit the streets. Shipping notifications for preorders landed in inboxes soon afterward. You can waltz into a Microsoft Store to pick up one of the new models, too.</p>
<h3><b>Beautiful display, good battery life</b></h3><p>PCWorld Senior Editor Mark Hachman found a lot to like in the Core i5 version of the Surface Pro 3, awarding it 4 out of 5 stars in his review <a href="http://go.pcworld.com/surpro3rev" target="_self">(go.pcworld.com/surpro3rev)</a>. In particular, he applauded the larger, gorgeous 12-inch display; the more ergonomic kickstand and Type Cover connection mechanism; and the battery life, which outdid that of previous Surface Pro generations. “With its latest tablet, Microsoft continues to home in on what buyers increasingly want: a spacious sheet of thin glass for work and play,” he wrote.</p>

    </div><p>The new versions should offer largely the same usability experience, though as the processors’ naming scheme suggests, the Core i3 model should be less potent than the Core i5 models, while the two pricey Core i7 machines should offer higher performance. Here’s how the pricing and configuration availability for the entire line looks now:</p>
<p>Intel Core i3, 64GB storage, 4GB of RAM: $799</p>
<p>Intel Core i5, 128GB storage, 4GB of RAM: $999</p>
<p>Intel Core i5, 256GB storage, 8GB of RAM: $1299</p>
<p>Intel Core i7, 256GB storage, 8GB of RAM: $1549</p>
<p>Intel Core i7, 512GB storage, 8GB of RAM: $1949</p>
<p>You can find more nitty-gritty details about the tablet’s components in “Surface Pro 3 by the Numbers”<a href="http://go.pcworld.com/surpro3num" target="_self">(go.pcworld.com/surpro3num)</a>.</p>
<p>The above prices are for the base tablet alone, though. The Surface Pro 3’s Type Cover accessory is a must-have, and it’ll set you back yet another $130. If you want to transform the laptop-tablet hybrid into a truly universal machine, Microsoft also offers a $200 docking station that, with the right accessories, can turn the tablet into an impromptu desktop, complete with multiple monitors and a discrete keyboard and mouse.</p>
