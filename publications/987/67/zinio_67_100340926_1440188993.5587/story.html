    </div><p><b>MICROSOFT’S WINDOWS PHONE</b> 8.1 Update 1 started rolling out in early August, but don’t get excited. Windows Phone 8.1 deserved a lot of attention, but I can’t say the same for Update 1, which I tried on my Lumia 1520 phablet (the update wasn’t available yet for our Nokia Icon test phone). It adds a nice feature or two, but nothing earth-shattering.</p>
<p>Download and installation took about 20 minutes or so, after which the OS reported itself as version 8.10.14147.180.</p>
<p>Update 1 consists of several minor tweaks. A couple of them, namely an updated Windows Phone Store tile and the new ability to forward and delete SMS messages in bulk, are simple additions that you’ll quickly forget about. Others—the addition of folders and VPN support, an update to the Xbox Music app, and updates to the Cortana digital assistant—are worth exploring a little.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the net effect of my brief period of playing with the update is that my Lumia 1520 feels a touch slower. And I hit a roadblock while testing the VPN capability, which was one of the features I most wanted to try.</p>

<p><b>An opened folder</b> appears as a small icon at the top, with the contents grouped below.</p>

    </div><h3><b>Folders ahoy</b></h3><p>Windows Phone 8 took a small step toward folders, introducing the ability to resize live tiles on the Start screen into small icons. With Windows Phone 8.1 Update 1, you can make those icons even smaller, and add a label to remind yourself of what’s in there.</p>
<p>In a manner similar to working with folders on Android or iOS, you can now create folders in Windows Phone by dragging and dropping one tile over another. To close the folder, however, you need to tap the folder icon at the top of the Windows Phone screen, rather than just tapping anywhere else on the screen. That’s different from Android’s approach, and it feels a bit awkward.</p>
<p>It’s also a bit time-intensive to drag, say, a contact out from People, pin it to the Start screen, and then drag the contact’s name into a folder. But grouping pinned apps together takes just seconds.</p>

    </div><h3><b>VPN support: For business only</b></h3><p>Virtual private network support will prove useful for anyone who wants to access protected resources while on the go. This feature, however, is particularly designed for businesspeople or for consumers who have subscribed to a private VPN, not for casual users.</p>
<p>To use the VPN, you need to start in the Settings menu; Microsoft then directs you to the Store to download a compatible VPN app. (You have to search for the app manually.) Afterward, you get the option of encrypting all traffic to and from the phone. You can also turn the VPN on or off, or set it to trigger when you access certain domains or sites.</p>
<p>My first experience with the VPN function ended quickly. I tried entering the IP address and password for our office VPN, but I wasn’t able to connect. I’ll be checking with our IT department, and you may have better luck if you do the same initially.</p>
<p>One nitpick: While editing an active VPN profile, I noticed that selecting the advanced options brings up a toggle labeled “Don’t use VPNs on company Wi-Fi,” with a default setting of Off. This double negative is needlessly confusing to users.</p>
<h3><b>Improved Xbox Music, enhanced Cortana</b></h3><p>I didn’t notice a difference in the updated Xbox Music app—but then again, I don’t subscribe to the service. It would be great if Xbox Music for Windows Phone let users play algorithmically generated “radio” stations.</p>
<p>Finally, there’s Cortana, which Microsoft says has new natural-language capabilities. That’s difficult to test, although a new “do an impression” request prompts Cortana (voiced by actress Jen Taylor) to run through a few famous lines. Microsoft has also adapted Cortana for the UK and China, among other regions. (At least on my phone, though, I can’t ask Cortana to speak in an English accent yet.)</p>
<p>As for the performance drag on my Lumia 1520, that could be a matter of perception, and I might easily solve my VPN problems with help. Your mileage with Windows Phone 8.1 Update 1 may vary. In any case, there’s little reason not to upgrade. Just don’t expect much.</p>
