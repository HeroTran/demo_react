    </div><p><b>AN IMAGE OF</b> an HTC One M8 running the Windows Phone operating system is currently on the Verizon Wireless site, providing compelling evidence that the company plans to sell the phone.</p>
<p>The URL of the image on the Verizon site identifies the hardware as the “HTC M8 Windows” phone.</p>
<p>HTC is slated to hold a media event in New York shortly before you read this, and rumors are indicating that the company plans to unveil a Windows Phone 8.1–powered version of its HTC One M8, one of the best-regarded Android phones released this year. The Verizon image appears to be proof that the handset will in fact come to market.</p>
<p>Apparently the HTC Windows Phone is a rebadging of the Android-powered One M8, and it will be running Windows Phone 8.1 Update 1. The mobile OS update supports Voice over LTE for improved clarity, a feature that the M8 for Windows will reportedly include as well.</p>
<p>For a closer look at the Android phone’s features, check out the review of the HTC One M8 <a href="http://go.pcworld.com/onem8" target="_self">(go.pcworld.com/onem8)</a> by our colleagues at Greenbot. Assuming the Windows Phone version is similar, you can expect a metal chassis, a lovely 5-inch screen, and HTC’s odd dual rear-facing cameras. There’s no guarantee that HTC won’t have a few surprises up its sleeve, however.</p>
<p>Verizon has dipped its toe into the Windows Phone market before; the carrier currently offers the aged HTC 8X for $50 on a two-year contract, for example. Windows Phone fans would be foolish to buy that model, however, when they can have the far superior Nokia Lumia Icon for free, again with a two-year contract. Until the launch of the “HTC M8 Windows,” your best bet is the Icon.</p>
