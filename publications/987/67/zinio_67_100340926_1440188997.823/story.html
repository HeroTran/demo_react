    </div><h3><b>The only PUP no one loves</b></h3><p>They’re called PUPs—potentially unwanted programs—and they sneak onto your system as accessories to the program you actually intend to install. They can slow performance, install space-stealing browser toolbars, and even invade your privacy.</p>
<p>You don’t have to give up free software to avoid PUPs, but you do have to pay attention during the installation, since each PUP first appears as a trap in the desired program’s installation wizard.</p>
<p>Here are tricks and traps to look out for during software installations.</p>

                                                                                                                                            <img src="/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0030-0127/93370-1-eng-GB/f0030-012.jpg" width="601" height="402"  style="border: 0px  ;" alt="f0030-01" title="f0030-01" />

    </div><h3><b>The suspect</b></h3><p>Not long ago, I needed a simple program that could do one simple task: convert a video DVD—a DVD I created myself, with no DRM issues—into an ISO file. So I downloaded FreeAudioVideoSoft’s All Free ISO Ripper. As I walked through the installation wizard, I found something of a PUP mother lode. Every dirty trick I knew, and a few I hadn’t seen before, popped up. This made the ISO ripper a perfect tool for teaching people how to install a program—and only that program.</p>
<p>So let’s click Next and get on with it.</p>

                                                                                                                                            <img src="/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0031-0118/93363-1-eng-GB/f0031-012.jpg" width="600" height="402"  style="border: 0px  ;" alt="f0031-01" title="f0031-01" />

    </div><h3><b>A false sense of security</b></h3><p>Okay, this second page of the wizard looks pretty harmless. In fact, it is pretty harmless.</p>
<p>The creators of the program even left the desktop shortcut option off by default. Good for them. Far too many programs want to mess up your desktop.</p>
<p>Enjoy this page. It’s the last good thing you’ll see from them for the rest of the installation.</p>

    </div><h3><b>The first trap: Standard installations</b></h3><p>How nice: The wizard recommends that you make your life a little easier with the Standard Installation. But check out the top of the window. This isn’t about installing All Free ISO Ripper. It’s about installing the AVG Toolbar. That’s not what you signed up for.</p>
<p>Here’s the first rule about avoiding PUPs: Never accept the “Standard Installation,” the “Express Installation,” the “Default Installation,” or any installation that is “(recommended).”</p>
<p>Always select the Custom installation option.</p>

<div class="">		

    
        
    
                                                                                                                                            <img src="/var/site_987/storage/images/media2/images/f0033-0119/93349-1-eng-GB/f0033-012.jpg" width="601" height="402"  style="border: 0px  ;" alt="f0033-01" title="f0033-01" />

    </div><h3><b>Disarm the trap</b></h3><p>Look what you get when you select Custom installation! You get options, already checked, not only to install the toolbar, but also to let it take over your browser’s homepage and search settings.</p>
<p>Is that why you’re installing a DVD-to-ISO ripping tool? I didn’t think so. Obviously, you need to uncheck those options before you continue.</p>

    </div><h3><b>Trap number 2: Advanced mode</b></h3><p>The next page in the installation wizard looks a lot like the last one, except that the default is “Express (recommended),” and the wizard wants to install something called PureLeads.</p>
<p>But this time, the wizard warns you that the Custom installation is “(advanced).” Uh-oh—this one is for hard-core techies! Do you dare click that option?</p>

    </div><h3><b>Trap number 2: Not so advanced after all</b></h3><p>If you can gather the courage to do so, you’ll find a single option that really isn’t all that advanced: Install PureLeads.</p>
<p>Go ahead. Uncheck this option. I feel confident that’s not too “advanced” for you.</p>

    </div><h3><b>A dirty shade of gray</b></h3><p>I give to various causes and charities. And they all bury me in email asking for more money. The last thing I need is a “Cause of the Month Reminder” from We-Care.com. (Why isn’t it <a href="http://We-Care.org" target="_self">We-Care.org</a>)? You want to click “I do not accept,” but you can’t because that option is grayed out!</p>
<p>Except it isn’t. It’s just gray.</p>
<p>This is a dirty trick. The option you want may look unavailable, but if you point your mouse to it, you may still be able to select it.</p>

    </div><h3><b>Say ‘I don’t’</b></h3><p>I tend not to trust supposed Windows “optimizers.” The software is often either too cautious to do any good or too reckless to be safe. So I would uncheck the option to install PC Utilities Pro: Optimizer Pro</p>
<p>Except, there’s no such option to uncheck.</p>
<p>You can uncheck I accept the terms of the Optimizer Pro Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, though. If you don’t want to install a program, you don’t have to accept its Terms of Use or Privacy Policy—even if it’s grayed out.</p>

    </div><h3><b>Read the fine print</b></h3><p>Finally! Something we all know and ignore: the program’s End User License Agreement. Before you select Accept, take a second look at this particular EULA. The title reads “All Free ISO Ripper includes RelevantKnowledge.” And you’ll notice that the first sentence also mentions RelevantKnowledge as software “included in this download.”</p>
<p>The real relevant knowledge, so to speak, is that this isn’t the All Free ISO Ripper EULA. Click Decline and go on.</p>

    </div><h3><b>Absolution</b></h3><p>Curiously enough, All Free ISO Ripper doesn’t have its own EULA. After I declined the RelevantKnowledge one, the real program—the one that I wanted—installed in seconds.</p>
<p>If you’re patient enough, you’ll ultimately get what you want—and only what you want.</p>

<p>That’s the thing about free software with PUPs: The installation is tricky. If you miss a trick or trap, you can waste time uninstalling software you never wanted to install in the first place.</p>
<p>But if you keep a keen eye out for tricks and traps, you can get something good for free</p>
