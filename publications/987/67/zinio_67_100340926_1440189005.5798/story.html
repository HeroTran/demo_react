<p><b>EVERYTHING WE’RE TOLD</b> about digital security says that you should never let strangers roam your network without your permission. But if you’re a Comcast customer, that’s exactly what will happen as the company’s Xfinity WiFi service rolls out. Fortunately, there’s a way for you to bar the door.</p>
<h3><b>With Xfinity WiFi, we’re all hotspots now</b></h3><p>If you live in a major metropolitan area on the East Coast or in the Midwest, chances are Xfinity WiFi is already operating in your area. The service takes advantage of the dual-band (2.5GHz/5GHz) Xfinity Wireless Gateway 2 modem (model DPC3939) that it has been distributing to customers for the past year. Comcast reserves one band and antenna for your own use, and one to serve as a public Xfinity WiFi hotspot.</p>
<p>There’s an easy way to tell whether the public hotspot is enabled on your modem: You should see an “xfinitywifi” public SSID broadcast from your own router. To access the public hotspot, users will need a Comcast Xfinity login and password.</p>

<p><b>All you’ll need</b> to log in to Xfinity WiFi is your Xfinity username and password.</p>
</figcaption>
    
    
    
    </div><p>Comcast customers at the “Performance” (25-megabits-persecond [mbps]) tier or above will be able to surf on any public Xfinity WiFi hotspot for an unlimited amount of time, for free. (If you’re a Comcast customer at a slower tier, or not a customer at all, you can try it free for two one-hour sessions, according to a Comcast spokesperson.)</p>
<p>To ensure that your bandwidth isn’t monopolized, only five people will be able to sign on to an Xfinity Wi-Fi hotspot at one time, the spokesperson added.</p>
<h3><b>Is sharing safe?</b></h3><p>Whether this raises security issues is a more difficult question to answer. According to Comcast, if someone logs on and begins downloading pornography, for example, such actions will be linked to that person’s account. You won’t be liable for their actions, the spokesperson said.</p>
<p>But whether that person will be able to access other devices on your network, including your hard drive, is a separate question. And Comcast’s response isn’t reassuring.</p>
<p>Comcast encourages users to set strong passwords, and it supplies antivirus software to its customers. If the company does detect an unusual amount or source of traffic, such as a customer who may have been infected by a virus and turned into a zombie, or bot <a href="http://go.pcworld.com/internetbot" target="_self">(go.pcworld.com/internetbot)</a>, that customer will be notified.</p>
<p>That doesn’t answer the question of whether, say, an elderly customer surfing away on an unprotected PC will be unduly exposed by Xfinity WiFi. Comcast recommends that customers use antivirus protection plus a firewall and take advantage of its gateway’s 128-bit WPA and WPA2 encryption. “If a consumer doesn’t put in the necessary precautions, to at least take some of these steps, they’re not doing everything they can to protect their account,” the spokesperson said.</p>

    </div><h3><b>Opting out</b></h3><p>Comcast says that users should have been notified of their router’s evolution into an Xfinity hotspot via email, mailers, and even a press release. If you don’t want Xfinity WiFi, however, you have to opt out. Here’s the process, as noted by Dwight Silverman <a href="http://go.pcworld.com/optout" target="_self">(go.pcworld.com/optout)</a>:</p>
<p>• Log in to your Comcast account page at <a href="http://customer.comcast.com/" target="_self">customer.comcast.com</a>.</p>
<p>• Click on Users &amp; Preferences.</p>
<p>• Look for a heading on the page for “Service Address.” Below your address, click the link that reads Manage Xfinity WiFi.</p>
<p>• Click the Disable Xfinity Wifi Home Hotspot button.</p>
<p>• Click Save.</p>
<p>You can also call Comcast and ask that they put the modem into “bridge mode.”</p>

<p><b>One great</b> alternative to the Comcast Xfinity gateway is this simple, inexpensive cable modem from Arris and Motorola.</p>
</figcaption>
    
    
    
    </div><h3><b>The answer: Buy an approved third-party router</b></h3><p>The easiest way, of course, is to simply ditch Comcast’s modem entirely. PCWorld Contributor Eric Geier gets into the nuts and bolts of how to do it <a href="http://go.pcworld.com/ditchcomcast" target="_self">(go.pcworld.com/ditchcomcast)</a>. To its credit, Comcast makes the process simple from its end as well.</p>
<p>First, check Comcast’s site to see whether your existing cable modem is expiring <a href="http://go.pcworld.com/expire" target="_self">(go.pcworld.com/expire)</a>, as Comcast may not tell you. An older modem may be hobbling your premiumbroadband service. Proceed to Comcast’s dedicated site to buy a new cable modem <a href="http://go.pcworld.com/buymodem" target="_self">(go.pcworld.com/buymodem)</a>.</p>
<p>On the Comcast site, you’ll find prices as low as $70 (new from Amazon) for the Arris/Motorola SB6121 bare-bones modem. (On the low end, of course, you’ll need to supply a separate router.) Have a look at the specs, too: The SB6121 can download at a rate of 172 megabits per second and upload at up to 131 mpbs. That’s more than enough for most small families, especially if your service is rated at only, say, 16 mbps. But if you’re thinking of upgrading to the Extreme 150 tier, for example, that might be pushing it a bit. The $90 Arris SB6141 downloads up to 343 mbps at a time.</p>
<p>You can also pay more, if you wish, to buy a true gateway with integrated router capabilities, including the most recent 802.11ac technology for higher-bandwidth wireless streaming and MoCA support for using your existing coaxial cables as wired networking cables.</p>
<p>It’s fairly certain that the third-party gateways on Comcast’s site won’t suddenly sprout Xfinity WiFi capabilities. Simply buy Comcast’s low-end recommended modem and attach your own router to it—either one you already own or a new model. (See PCWorld’s roundup of the best 802.11ac routers of 2013 <a href="http://go.pcworld.com/80211acroundup" target="_self">[go.pcworld.com/80211acroundup]</a>.)</p>
<p>The most annoying part of the process may be returning your existing router and phoning in your new router’s MAC (media access control) address to ensure it can be identified by your cable provider.</p>
<h3><b>Control, and peace of mind</b></h3><p>So far, Comcast hasn’t given any indication that it will penalize users for not adopting its Xfinity WiFi router. In other words, you can opt out of supplying a public Wi-Fi hotspot, and still take advantage of other Xfinity hotspots in airports and elsewhere. (Or Starbucks, for that matter.) And with 4G cellular plans becoming cheaper, there’s always the option of tethering to your phone, too.</p>
<p>The bottom line, however, is that owning your own cable modem allows you to save money and control your own security. And if Comcast’s new Xfinity WiFi hotspot network weirds you out, that’s another reason to switch.</p>
