    </div><p>Watch the video at <a href="http://go.pcworld.com/ativvid" target="_self">go.pcworld.com/ativvid</a></p>
<p><b>BASED ON THE</b> way most laptops sound, I’d venture a guess that audio is the last thing engineers think about when they design laptops. But I won’t lump Samsung’s 2014 ATIV Book 9 <a href="http://go.pcworld.com/ativ9" target="_self">(go.pcworld.com/ativ9)</a> in that crowd, because it sounds absolutely divine—especially with headphones.</p>
<p>The Samsung ATIV Book 9 is a beautiful, elegantly thin laptop that will turn heads when you pull it out of your designer messenger bag. It’s the thinnest, sexiest notebook we’ve reviewed this year. But it’s much more pedestrian under the hood—with one exception. It’s equipped with a Wolfson WM5102 audio CODEC (encoder/decoder). Wolfson produces some of the world’s finest DACs (digital-to-analog converters).</p>
<p>But it’s not entirely accurate to describe the ATIV Book 9 as being equipped with a Wolfson DAC. I don’t mean to split hairs, but that description might lead you to think that this laptop is equipped with the same type of audio subsystem found in high-end outboard DACs. Wolfson’s WM5102 was designed for smartphones. It does have a DAC, but this one chip also integrates a host of other functions that are handled by discrete processors in top-shelf audio gear.</p>
<p class="pullQuote">The Samsung ATIV Book 9, however, is the best-sounding laptop that I’ve ever listened to.</p>
<p>The ATIV Book 9, however, is the bestsounding laptop that I’ve ever listened to. The DAC inside the WM5102 can convert audio tracks with up to 24-bit resolution and sample rates up to 192kHz and deliver them to its headphone jack at an exceptionally high signal-to-noise ratio of 113 decibels (this according to Wolfson’s data sheet). I don’t have the measurement gear to verify that claim, but I can tell you that my ears definitely enjoyed the experience.</p>
<p>I automatically installed Foobar2000 (<a href="http://foobar2000.org" target="_self">foobar2000.org</a>) on the ATIV Book 9, because I’ve never encountered a fresh-from-the-factory Windows computer than could handle FLAC files.</p>
<p>But then I found ArcSoft’s S Player+ on the ATIV Book 9. This audio/video player is exceedingly basic, but when you use it to play losslessly encoded audio tracks, it gives you the option to play them in “lossless music mode” through the headphone jack. And for a while, I thought that this was the only way to tap the Wolfson WM5102, because the tracks didn’t sound nearly as good when I played them using Foobar2000.</p>
<p class="pullQuote">Foobar 2000 was able to play all my high-resolution tracks.</p>
<p>After a few email exchanges with Samsung, I learned that S Player+ uses Microsoft’s WASAPI (Windows Audio Session API) to take complete control of the Wolfson WM5102. Using WASAPI, S Player+ can send an audio bit stream directly to the Wolfson WM5102, bypassing the Windows mixer and muting all other sounds. Once I installed the WASAPI component in Foobar2000, tracks on that player sounded just as sweet as they did with S Player+. And unlike that software, Foobar2000 was able to play all my high-resolution tracks.</p>

<p><b>S Player+</b> can play FLAC files. But it had trouble with some high-res audio files, and it sometimes refused to display album art.</p>

    </div><p>So the ATIV Book 9 is a beautiful laptop that sounds divine. But with Samsung expecting the model reviewed here to fetch $1500, I had to dig deeper to determine if its price-to-performance ratio is reasonable.</p>
<h3><b>So what else you got?</b></h3><p>That $1500 buys you an Intel Core i5-4200U CPU with integrated graphics driving a 15.6-inch touchscreen at 1920 by 1080 pixels. The system also comes with 8GB of memory, but only a 128GB SSD.</p>
<p>Spend another $130, and you can get Toshiba’s Satellite P50t-BST2N01 with a Core i7 processor, 16GB memory and a discrete AMD GPU driving its 15.6-inch display at 4K resolution.</p>
<p>The Toshiba is thicker and heavier, its audio components aren’t anywhere near as luscious, and its battery life is appalling, but that’s a lot of extras for not very much money. And then there’s Dell’sInspiron 15 7000-series laptop, also with a Core i7 CPU, and a discrete Nvidia GPU driving its 15.6-inch touchscreen at the same resolution as the Samsung.</p>

<p><b>The presence of an SSD</b> helped the ATIV Book 9 edge past Dell’s Core i7-powered Inspiron 7537. The Toshiba is outfitted with a hybrid drive.</p>
</figcaption>
    
    
    
    </div><p>The Dell has a mechanical drive, and it’s more than a pound heavier, but it offers twice as much memory and costs $260 less.</p>
<p>Samsung’s machine does have other positive attributes. Its backlit, island-style keyboard feels awesome under the fingertips. And its oversized trackpad is exceedingly responsive and accurate. And despite its slim proportions, Samsung’s engineers managed to squeeze in two USB 3.0 ports, one USB 2.0 port, a full-sized HDMI out, gigabit ethernet, an SD card slot, and even an analog video output.</p>
<h3><b>Performance</b></h3><p>In terms of benchmarks, the ATIV Book 9 squeaked past Dell’s Inspiron 7537 in our Laptop WorldBench 9 benchmark suite. This can be attributed to the presence of an SSD in the Samsung versus the mechanical hard drive in Dell’s machine. PCMark 8—which is one component in that suite—is particularly sensitive to storage performance. But Samsung’s reliance on integrated graphics resulted in its getting crushed in our gaming benchmarks. This is clearly not the machine to buy if you intend to play AAA games. Battery life, on the other hand, is excellent.</p>
<p>The Samsung ATIV Book 9 is one of the sexiest laptops to come through the Lab this year, but it’s expensive for the processing power, memory, storage, and video resolution it has to offer. If you’re passionate about high-quality audio, this laptop’s premium price tag is probably justified. Just be sure to install Foobar2000 and its WASAPI component before you plug in your favorite headphones.</p>

<h3><b>Samsung ATIV Book 9 (2014 Edition)</b></h3><p><b>PROS:</b></p>
<p>• Excellent build quality</p>
<p>• Very high-quality audio subsystem</p>
<p>• Every I/O port you could want</p>
<p><b>CONS:</b></p>
<p>• Crappy audio software undermines the benefit of the audio hardware</p>
<p>• Skimps on memory and storage</p>
<p><b>BOTTOM LINE:</b></p>
<p>Samsung’s ATIV Book 9 is an exquisitely designed laptop with an unusually high-quality audio subsystem, but it’s also very expensive.</p>
<p>$1500</p>
