<p><b>The ThinkPad 10’s</b> display is its best feature.</p>
</figcaption>
    
    
    
    </div><p><b>LENOVO’</b> ThinkPad 2 was a great tablet, but its design was chunky, and its screen had fewer pixels than that of the smaller and newer ThinkPad 8. Most important, Intel’s older Atom platform struggled to run Windows 8 smoothly. The Lenovo ThinkPad 10 <a href="http://go.pcworld.com/thinkpad10" target="_self">(go.pcworld.com/thinkpad10)</a> improves in all of those respects without sacrificing any of the great quality or productivity perks of the ThinkPad line.</p>
<p>Thin and light, yet solid, the ThinkPad 10 is the slimmest large-screen Windows tablet we’ve encountered lately, edging out the Surface Pro 3 (0.35 inch versus 0.36 inch). The tablet weighs a scant 1.32 pounds.</p>
<p>Although the soft, matte-plastic back does not quite match the grippy, soft-touch texture of older ThinkPads, it feels nice. Because the back isn’t metal, the screen has a little flex, but not to a worrisome extent.</p>

<p><b>The tablet’s mismatched</b> corners are an odd design choice.</p>
</figcaption>
    
    
    
    </div><p>The 1900-by-1200-pixel resolution is a joy to work with. I appreciate the extra space over a 1080p screen, and even with a 10.1-inch display such as this, I’m comfortable with the scaling turned down some to fit even more in. The brightness range is wide, too, going from bright enough to compete with window glare to dim enough to read in the dark without burning out my retinas.</p>
<p>One odd design decision is the mismatched corners. The bottom two corners are square, more in line with the boxy ThinkPad aesthetic, and they fit well in the various docks. The top corners, in contrast, are rounded. The square corners do feel awkward to hold after a while, though, so it might have been better to round all the corners.</p>

<p><b>The ThinkPad 10’s</b> benchmark performance is on par with other Intel-powered Windows tablets, although it finished slightly behind Dell’s Venue 11 Pro.</p>
</figcaption>
    
    
    
    </div><p>In the ThinkPad 10, Lenovo is taking advantage of the fact that the Intel Atom Z3795 is 64-bit capable. Our review unit came with only 2GB of RAM, but Lenovo offers the option to upgrade to 4GB of RAM and 64-bit Windows. You can purchase models with either 64GB or 128GB of storage.</p>
<p>Running a faster Atom in a thinner package can generate more heat: The tablet stayed cool when I was writing or browsing, but the right side got uncomfortably warm when I performed more-intense tasks.</p>
<p>Despite having a slightly faster Atom processor than the similarly equipped Dell Venue 11 Pro, the ThinkPad 10 performed just behind it on most of our benchmark tests. Battery life is good for a light day’s work, lasting 5 hours, 45 minutes--just 11 minutes longer than the Dell Venue 11 Pro. Our battery-rundown test is harsh, so you might get better results. Dell still has the advantage, though, as its mobile keyboard dock comes with an extra battery that significantly boosts its run time. The ThinkPad 10’s Ultrabook keyboard ($119) lacks a battery option.</p>

    </div><p>What the Ultrabook keyboard dock does have is fantastic keys. They are a little close together, but the travel and feedback are right in line with what I’m used to from ThinkPad keyboards.</p>
<p>The Ultrabook keyboard is not a clamshell dock; the tablet sits in a groove in the back, held by magnets. Unfortunately, the docked tablet is stuck at a fixed angle, tilted too far back for my taste. To cover the screen for travel, you must take the tablet out and slot it into a different groove.</p>

    </div><p>Also available is a desktop dock ($129), which holds the tablet at a better angle and provides two USB 3.0 ports, a full-size HDMI port, and ethernet. The tablet slots onto a physical connector that sticks up and can be tricky to seat properly.</p>
<p>Lenovo’s Quickshot cover ($45) for the ThinkPad 10 is every bit as nice as the one that goes with the ThinkPad 8. I find using the camera on a 10-inch tablet to be a bit gimmicky, but the ThinkPad 10’s 8-megapixel rear camera takes nice shots, and the Quickshot cover makes getting into the camera app easy. The cover folds to prop up the tablet at several good angles for tabletop use. It attaches magnetically using the same guide holes as the various docks do, so you must take it off to dock the tablet.</p>
<p>Last, but not least, the ThinkPad 10 comes with a digitizer pen. The battery-less pen writes and draws smoothly with no lag. You can store the pen in a slot in the Ultrabook keyboard dock or in a pen loop on the Quickshot cover.</p>
<p>The ThinkPad 10 ticks a lot of the right boxes. The most important element, the screen, is top-notch. The Atom processor is more than capable for everyday tasks, especially with 4GB of RAM. And the wide array of accessories covers the majority of uses and input preferences.</p>
<p class="pullQuote">The Lenovo ThinkPad 10 ticks a lot of the right boxes.</p>
<h3><b>Lenovo ThinkPad 10</b></h3><p><b>PROS:</b></p>
<p>• Strong performance • Good battery life • Beautiful 1920-by-1200-pixel display • Thin and light</p>
<p><b>CONS:</b></p>
<p>• Ultrabook keyboard dock allows just one angle • Can run hot with demanding apps</p>
<p><b>BOTTOM LINE:</b></p>
<p>Bottom line: Lenovo’s productivityoriented tablet is a joy to use, but it suffers from a few ill-conceived design decisions.</p>
