<p><b>DELL REDESIGNED</b> its Alienware gaming laptop series in 2013. The Alienware 17 <a href="http://go.pcworld.com/alien17" target="_self">(go.pcworld.com/alien17)</a> now sports curves instead of lines, lines instead of plain surfaces, and steel-gray, anodized aluminum and magnesium alloy instead of rubbery plastic.</p>
<p>As this is a gaming notebook, however, it’s what’s on the inside that really counts. The 2014 Alienware 17 is one of the first laptops to ship with an Nvidia GeForce GTX 880M graphics card, which has a stunning 8GB of GDDR5 memory. Nvidia’s 800M-series GPUs also have new gameroriented features, including the Battery Boost mode for extending gameplay time and the ShadowPlay game-capture software.</p>
<p>Of course, the Alienware 17 is packed with other sweet specs, too, including a fourth-generation Intel Core i7-4910MQ processor (overclocked to 4.1GHz), 16GB of DDR3/1600 memory, a 256GB solid-state drive for fast startup, and a 1TB, 5400-rpm hard drive for storage.</p>
<p>The notebook also has built-in Wi-Fi 802.11a/b/g/n, Bluetooth 4.0, and a gigabit ethernet port, plus a slot-loading Blu-ray reader and four USB 3.0 ports. Our review model came with Windows 7 Home Premium. You can order an Alienware 17 with Windows 8.1 on Dell’s website, but be aware that this unit lacks a touchscreen. As configured, our review model cost $3385, with online discounts reducing it to $2968. That price tag puts it in the middle of high-end gaming notebooks.</p>

    </div><h3><b>Performance:Excellent</b></h3><p>The Alienware 17 performed well in our tests, achieving a Laptop WorldBench 9 score of 122. That makes the Alienware 17 the best portable performer we’ve tested so far on WorldBench 9.</p>
<p>The graphics performance is excellent, as you might expect. (It still can’t rival the insanely powerful multiple-GPU setups you can stuff into a desktop tower, but if you’re desperate for dual-GPU performance, the 18.4-inch Alienware 18 has a dual-GeForce GTX 880M option.) With its single 880M graphics card, the Alienware 17 delivered excellent frame rates in all of our medium-quality graphics tests at resolution of 1920 by 1080 pixels. In BioShock Infinite, the Alienware 17 generated 121 frames per second; in Grid 2, it posted a frame rate of 135 fps.</p>

    </div><h3><b>Design: Alienware steps up</b></h3><p>System designers can’t do much to make a massive, 17.3-inch, 9.8-pound laptop look sexy. But Dell’s Alienware team--which operates at least somewhat independently from the mothership--did a great job of refining and polishing its gaming machines. This iteration has an attractive metal cover, with well-placed curves and lines vaguely reminiscent of a Lamborghini. The laptop also feels extremely solid, as if the chassis could survive a plummet from a second-story window.</p>
<p>Inside, it has a full-size keyboard, a numeric keypad, and a mediumsize touchpad with two discrete mouse buttons. The upper-right corner houses a large power button, and only a few extra hotkeys sit above the number pad.</p>
<p>Sporting large, soft-touch keys, the keyboard is comfortable to use. The keys, however, are a little slippery, which you’ll notice if you type quickly, and they provide weak tactile feedback. The touchpad is not quite as responsive as I’d like, but the mouse buttons are easy to press.</p>
<p>The keyboard is backlit, and Alienware provides a ten-zone lighting system you can customize with a software utility. Gamers will appreciate the four lighting zones dedicated to the keyboard and number pad (three for the former and one for the latter). The zone covering the touchpad, which lights up each time you touch it, is particularly fun, if a little distracting.</p>

    </div><h3><b>Screen and speakers: Yeah and meh</b></h3><p>The 17.3-inch display has a native resolution of 1920 by 1080 pixels. The bright antiglare screen presents crisp and accurate colors, and off-axis viewing angles look great. My only complaint is that the display appears a bit pixelated, especially if you’re used to smaller, higher-resolution screens. If you use this laptop primarily for work, you’ll notice this effect more than if you use it only to play games. HD video plays back nicely, with deep blacks and just a little artifacting in fast-paced scenes.</p>
<p>As for audio capabilities, the speakers produce fairly full, bassinundated sound. They’re better than the average set of laptop speakers, but I’ve definitely heard superior sound on other desktop replacements of a similar size. The Alienware 17 has a headphone jack, a microphone jack, and a combination headphone/microphone jack, which is good news for gamers with headsets.</p>
<p>The Alienware 17 is attractive, fast, and specced to the max. It’s the best laptop performer we’ve tested so far, and it’s lightweight for a machine in this category. Even though it has its drawbacks, this is one of the better-looking 17.3-inch notebooks, and it certainly delivers on performance.</p>
<h3><b>Alienware 17 (2014 edition)</b></h3><p><b>PROS:</b></p>
<p>• Rugged yet attractive chassis</p>
<p>• Exceptional performance</p>
<p>• Customizable ten-zone lighting system</p>
<p><b>CONS:</b></p>
<p>• Relatively short battery life</p>
<p>• Could use a better keyboard and touchpad</p>
<p><b>BOTTOM LINE:</b></p>
<p>The Alienware 17 is stylish and powerful, but only hard-core gamers will want to take this 9.5-pound beast on the road.</p>
<p>$2968 (as configured)</p>
