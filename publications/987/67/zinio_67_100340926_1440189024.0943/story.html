    </div><p><b>I LIKED WESTERN DIGITAL’</b> My Cloud network-attached storage device when I reviewed it last year, but relying on a single-drive NAS can be risky. If that drive fails, and you don’t have a backup, you could lose all your data.</p>

<p><b>You can use the</b> USB 3.0 ports for backup (to or from the My Cloud Mirror) or for additional storage.</p>

    </div><p>WD’s My Cloud Mirror <a href="http://go.pcworld.com/mcmirror" target="_self">(go.pcworld.com/mcmirror)</a> solves that problem by putting a second drive in the same enclosure, and configuring the drives as RAID 1. All the same data is written to both drives, so that if one drive fails, you can recover everything from the other.</p>
<p>Our review model came with two 2TB drives, yielding 2TB of storage (not 4TB, because the drives are in RAID 1). You can reconfigure the drives in RAID 0 for blinding speed and 4TB of storage, but that would throw your data-redundancy strategy right out the window.</p>
<p>The My Cloud Mirror will also let you back up its contents to another storage device via its USB 3.0 port, but an even better data security strategy would be to deploy a second My Cloud Mirror (or a My Cloud EX2 or EX4) at a remote location and back up the contents of each drive to the other (you can also do this over your local network, but that’s not as safe as having backups at different physical locations).</p>
<p>WD’s software will also let you back up your My Cloud Mirror to the cloud (using either your ElephantDrive or Amazon S3 account. What it won’t let you do is back up a client to the My Cloud Mirror itself over an Internet connection; you have to attach the client to the same local network as the My Cloud Mirror.</p>

<p><b>The My Cloud Mirror’s</b> user interface is well laid out and easy to understand.</p>

    </div><p>Unlike a Dropbox account, which maintains a folder on your local device that is synchronized with your cloud storage, files are stored only on the My Cloud device. The benefit to this approach is that you don’t consume the limited storage on your device. The drawback is that you need to have Internet access to be able to retrieve your files.</p>
<p>Western Digital is marketing the My Cloud Mirror to consumers, and this box has most of the features that audience will want. It has an integrated FTP server and peer-to-peer file-sharing.</p>
<p>Western Digital populates the My Cloud Mirror with its own WD Red drives, which are designed for 24/7 operation. The balance of the box’s hardware features tilt toward consumer more than SMB. It has just one gigabit ethernet interface and one power connector, so you have no failover protection on either count.</p>

<p><b>The My Cloud Mirror</b> isn’t the fastest NAS box we’ve tested—by a long shot—but it offers plenty of features and is very easy to use.</p>

    </div><p>Consumers will appreciate the My Cloud Mirror’s simple graphical user interface, which makes this machine very easy to set up. It comes from the factory with both iTunes and DLNA media servers for streaming media to PCs, smart TVs, mobile devices (smartphones and tablets), and media-streaming boxes in your home.</p>
<p>WD publishes a number of Android and iOS apps that will help you derive maximum benefit from the My Cloud Mirror.</p>
<p class="pullQuote">If you use NAS to store critical files, the My Cloud Mirror is a solid buy.</p>
<p>The My Cloud Mirror is no barn-burner when it comes to performance. It wasn’t terrible at dealing with very large files (we test read and write performance with a single 10GB file), but it was considerably slower reading and writing our 10GB collection of files. And that will likely be the more common real-world usage scenario.</p>
<p>If you think you’d benefit from the additional features that the My Cloud EX2 has to offer (dual ethernet, dual powersupply inputs, and 10 licenses for WD’s SmartWare Pro), that box is street-priced just $18 higher than the My Cloud Mirror.</p>
<p>The original My Cloud is a very good—if a bit slow—consumer-oriented NAS box, and the My Cloud Mirror adds a valuable feature in RAID 1. If you use your NAS to store critical files, this is a solid buy.</p>

    </div><h3><b>Western Digital My Cloud Mirror</b></h3><p><b>PROS:</b></p>
<p>• RAID 1 provides data security</p>
<p>• Can back up to other WD NAS boxes</p>
<p>• Very easy to set up and use</p>
<p><b>CONS:</b></p>
<p>• Cannot sync with other WD NAS boxes</p>
<p>• Moderately slow performance</p>
<p><b>BOTTOM LINE:</b></p>
<p>WD’s My Cloud Mirror doesn’t deliver barn-burning performance, but it’s very easy to set up and use and it delivers almost everything you could want in a consumer NAS box.</p>
