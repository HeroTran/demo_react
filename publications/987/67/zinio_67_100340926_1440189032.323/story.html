<p><b>WORKING AT HOME</b> has a lot of upsides, but one major downside: Home furniture is designed for leisure, not work. Dining tables are too high, coffee tables are too low, and lap desks are too small and unstable. If you spend a lot of time on your laptop, those poor ergonomics invite a host of back problems, repetitive strain injuries, and other maladies.</p>
<p>Set up Coalesse’s Free Stand (<a href="http://www.coalesse.com" target="_self">www.coalesse.com</a>) in front of just about any chair, and you have a work-friendly environment that will keep you productive and healthy. And when the factory whistle blows at the end of the day, you can fold the Free Stand flat and slide it under your sofa or easy chair to rid yourself of the irksome visual reminder that you have to work for a living.</p>

    </div><p>The Free Stand is well made, with a stand fabricated from extruded aluminum painted with a durable powder-coat finish. A pair of 22-inch-long feet give it stability, and an 18-inch-wide opening between them accommodates your feet. The work surface rotates a full 360 degrees, so you can also orient the base sideways to your lap. You can lower it to 20 inches and raise it as high as 27 inches, so you should be able to find the ideal height whether you’re sitting at a dining room table, on a sofa, or in a beanbag chair. It’s too short to function as a standing workstation, though.</p>
<p>The work surface measures just over 19 inches wide by 11 inches deep—roomy enough to accommodate a 14-inch laptop, but I had to slide the computer to the left a wee bit to make room for a mouse. According to Coalesse, you can wipe away spills from the rigid ABS plastic surface using typical household cleaning products, such as Windex or Formula 409, but avoid bleach-based products and hand sanitizers as they can discolor or damage the nonslip painted finish.</p>

<p><b>When collapsed,</b> the Free Stand is just 5 inches tall.</p>

    </div><p>The Free Stand has one handle and three control mechanisms. To fold it flat, lower the work surface by pushing a button at the top of its pillar. Pull a lever underneath the work surface to drop it to a right angle to the pillar (it will lock in that position). Push a second button at the bottom of the pillar to fold the stand flat. Repeat the same three steps in reverse to set it up again. The Free Stand’s smooth feet glide over hard-surfaced floors and carpets with equal ease.</p>
<h3><b>Pricey but nice</b></h3><p>The Free Stand weighs 11 pounds, and the handle makes it easy to carry from one room to another, although it’s a tad too hefty for travel.</p>
<p>I like everything about the Free Stand except its $399 price tag. You could probably find a laptop stand at Ikea for a fraction of that price, but not with the same high-quality construction, and it probably wouldn’t fold up. The Free Stand is built to last, you can stash it anywhere, and it’s a joy to use.</p>
<h3><b>Coalesse Free Stand</b></h3><p><b>PROS:</b></p>
<p>• Sturdy and built to last</p>
<p>• Folds to 5 inches flat</p>
<p>• Lightweight—just 11 pounds</p>
<p><b>CONS:</b></p>
<p>• Expensive</p>
<p>• Work surface isn’t wide enough to accommodate a mouse</p>
<p><b>BOTTOM LINE:</b></p>
<p>The Free Stand is undeniably expensive, but this well-built mobile work surface will improve home office ergonomics and productivity.</p>
<p>$399</p>
