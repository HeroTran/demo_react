<p>That’s not to say 802.11ac is about to fall by the wayside—the IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers) didn’t officially ratify this wireless standard until December 2013. It’s just that the chipsets capable of delivering all the features and performance of 802.11ac are still in development.</p>
<p>The truth is, most of the first 802.11ac routers on the market were based on draft versions of the 802.11ac standard. Although some newer Wave 1 models, such as Netgear’s six-antenna Nighthawk X6, are implementing a few cool tricks to squeeze more performance from that technology, a second wave of 802.11ac routers will hit store shelves in early 2015. Those devices will support optional features that will deliver even higher wireless performance. Around the same time, new and complementary wireless standards made for specialized applications will also appear.</p>
<p>In the end, there’s no point in trying to cheat obsolescence by putting off your next router purchase, because the industry is already hard at work developing the successor to 802.11ac.</p>
<p class="pullQuote"><b>The second wave of 802.11ac routers will deliver even higher wireless performance.</b></p>
<h3><b>The two-party system</b></h3><p>The IEEE defines Wi-Fi standards such as 802.11ac and the older 802.11n. The Wi-Fi Alliance (an association of companies that build wireless-networking devices) certifies that the hardware based on those standards will work together.</p>
<p>Wi-Fi Alliance certification is not a requirement—hardware manufacturers pay for the designation—but it can be reassuring to consumers, especially in the early days of a new standard. The promise that hardware will work as expected is important because the IEEE can take years to finalize standards; for example, it started working on 802.11ac in 2008 and finished in late 2013. Equipment makers often don’t want to wait, so as soon as the ink dries on an early draft, they market new products based on that draft standard. Buffalo shipped out the first 802.11ac router in 2012, but the Wi-Fi Alliance didn’t launch its first 802.11ac certification program until the middle of 2013.</p>

    </div><p>What’s so special about 802.11ac? For starters, it operates on the 5GHz frequency band, which is less crowded than the 2.4GHz band; as a result, its signal is less susceptible to interference.</p>
<p>In addition, its performance significantly exceeds that of the previous standard. SU-MIMO (single-user multiple-input/multiple-output) technology, one of the hallmarks of the older 802.11n standard, allows the transmission of multiple spatial streams to a single client. This technology carries over to 802.11ac, which adds a morepowerful modulation technique (among other things) to produce an impressive maximum physical link rate of 433 megabits per second per spatial stream.</p>

    </div><p>Because a Wave 1 802.11ac router can support up to three streams simultaneously, it can send and receive data at a top physical link rate of 1.3 gigabits per second. Compare that with an 802.11n router, which provides up to three spatial streams with a maximum physical link rate of 150 mbps each (for aggregate throughput of 450 mbps).</p>
<p>In April, Quantenna Communications announced its first Wave 2 802.11ac chipset <a href="http://go.pcworld.com/quantenna" target="_self">(go.pcworld.com/quantenna)</a>. The second wave of 802.11ac routers is slated to arrive sometime next year. These router models will take advantage of optional elements of the 802.11ac standard. First, they’ll support MU-MIMO (multiuser multiple-input/multipleoutput) technology, which will allow them to transmit multiple spatial streams to multiple clients simultaneously.</p>

    </div><p>Second, they’ll bond multiple channels on the 5GHz frequency band to create a single channel that has 160MHz of bandwidth. (Wave 1 802.11ac routers can bond 5GHz channels, but the resulting channel is only 80MHz wide.) Third, whereas 802.11n and Wave 1 802.11ac routers support a maximum of three spatial streams, Wave 2 802.11ac routers can support as many as eight spatial streams.</p>
<p>Using wider channels or additional spatial streams (not enough bandwidth is available to do both), improved beamforming <a href="http://go.pcworld.com/beamform" target="_self">(go.pcworld.com/beamform)</a>, and other techniques, Wave 2 802.11ac routers will deliver maximum physical link rates in the range of 7 to 10 gbps.</p>
<h3><b>The next new Wi-Fi:IEEE 802.11ax</b></h3><p>In a recent briefing, Greg Ennis, the Wi-Fi Alliance’s vice president of technology, said the IEEE anticipates that the successor to 802.11ac will be 802.11ax. Although the standards body doesn’t expect to ratify 802.11ax before March 2019, products based on a draft could reach the market as early as 2016—just as we saw draft-802.11n and draft-802.11ac products before those standards received official ratification.</p>
<p>One of the top objectives of 802.11ax, according to Ennis, is to quadruple speed to individual network clients—not just to increase the speed of the network overall. Chinese manufacturer Huawei, which has engineers in the IEEE 802.11ax working group, has already reported Wi-Fi connection speeds up to 10.53 gbps on the 5GHz band.</p>
<p>Ennis said the 802.11ax standard will improve Wi-Fi speed and reliability in environments with high numbers of users, such as hotspots in public venues, by employing the available spectrum more efficiently, doing a better job of managing interference, and enhancing underlying protocols such as MAC (medium access control) data communication.</p>
<p class="pullQuote">Products based on a draft of the 802.11ax standard could reach the market as early as 2016.</p>
<p>The 802.11ax standard will also use OFDMA (orthogonal frequency-division multiple access) to boost the amount of data a router can transmit. Like OFDM (orthogonal frequencydivision multiplexing), OFDMA encodes data on multiple subcarrier frequencies, essentially packing more data into the same amount of air space. The “multiple access” portion of the OFDMA name describes a means of assigning subsets of those subcarrier frequencies to individual users.</p>
<h3><b>Complementary standards</b></h3><p>While one segment of the IEEE is working to define the successor to 802.11ac, other factions are developing two complementary wireless-networking standards that address particular needs.</p>
<p>First, the IEEE 802.11ad <a href="http://go.pcworld.com/80211ad" target="_self">(go. pcworld.com/80211ad)</a> standard employs unlicensed spectrum in the 60GHz frequency band to build fast short-range wireless networks with peak transmission rates of around 7 gbps.</p>
<p class="pullQuote">The few 60GHz products to reach the market are designed to operate at very short range.</p>
<p>Transmitting data at 60GHz has two major drawbacks: The extremely short waves have difficulty penetrating walls, and oxygen molecules begin to absorb electromagnetic energy at 60GHz. That explains why the relatively few 60GHz products to reach the market so far are designed to operate at very short range, or just within a single room. The Dell Wireless Dock D5000 <a href="http://go.pcworld.com/dockd5000" target="_self">(go.pcworld.com/dockd5000)</a> is a good example of the former, and the DVDO Air <a href="http://go.pcworld.com/dvdoair" target="_self">(go.pcworld.com/dvdoair)</a>, which streams HD video and audio from a Blu-ray player to a video projector without a cable, is a great example of the latter.</p>
<p>In late 2013 the Wi-Fi Alliance announced its 802.11ad certification brand: The group will stamp interoperable 802.11ad products as “WiGig Certified”<a href="http://go.pcworld.com/wigig" target="_self">(go.pcworld.com/wigig)</a> when the certification program begins in 2015.</p>
<p>The IEEE 802.11ah standard, meanwhile, resides at the opposite end of the spectrum. Operating in the unlicensed 900MHz frequency band, a wireless network based on 802.11ah would easily penetrate walls, but it wouldn’t deliver much bandwidth—only 100 kbps to 40 mbps. Such technology might be useful for sensors and probes in connected homes or commercial buildings; 802.11ah could be considered a competitor to the Z-Wave and ZigBee protocols in the “Internet of Things” arena, too. The IEEE isn’t expected to ratify this standard until January 2016.</p>

<h3><b>Wi-Fi for every need</b></h3><p>Look past all the alphabet soup, and you’ll see that the future of Wi-Fi centers on the evolution of standards that can meet the demands of new generations of wirelessly connected devices. When those new generations include everything from enterprise printers to egg timers, you can bet we’ll need all of the flavors of Wi-Fi that are coming down the pike.</p>
