    </div><p><b>STARTUP PROGRAMS, JUNK</b> files, and even clumps of dust weigh down your PC, making it slow down over time. Give your PC’s software and hardware a quick tune-up, and it should run just as it did the day you bought it. Inexpensive hardware upgrades can even make it faster than it was brand-new (go.pcworld.com/hwup).</p>
<h3><b>Software tune-ups</b></h3><h4><b>1. Disable or remove unwanted startup programs</b></h4><p>Many programs install system tray utilities or services that piggyback on your system’s startup routine, slowing boot time and wasting RAM.</p>
<p>In Windows 8, right-click your taskbar, select Task Manager, click More details, and, in the Startup tab, disable programs you don’t need.</p>
<p>In Windows 7, use the Startup Manager in CCleaner to change which programs start up when the system boots <a href="http://go.pcworld.com/cclean" target="_self">(go.pcworld.com/cclean)</a>. In CCleaner, navigate to Tools &gt; Startup.</p>
<h4><b>2. Clean up unnecessary system files</b></h4><p>Use a tool such as CCleaner or Disk Cleanup <a href="http://go.pcworld.com/diskclean" target="_self">(go.pcworld.com/diskclean)</a>, included in Windows, to clear out system files you don’t need. They take up space and can slow down your PC.</p>
<p>To open the Disk Cleanup program on Windows, tap the &lt;Windows&gt; key to get to the Start menu or Start screen. Type Disk Cleanup, and click the <i>Free up disk space by deleting unnecessary</i>files shortcut in Windows 8 or the Disk Cleanup shortcut in Windows 7.</p>
<p>CCleaner can clean up even more types of temporary files. You may want to tweak its settings first, as it will erase your browser history, cookies, cache, and other data you may want to keep.</p>

    </div><h4><b>3. Defragment and optimize your hard drives</b></h4><p>Modern versions of Windows defragment drives in the background, so it’s probably not necessary to do so manually <a href="http://go.pcworld.com/defragging" target="_self">(go. pcworld.com/defragging)</a>. Still, it doesn’t hurt.</p>
<p>Tap the &lt;Windows&gt; key to open the Start menu or Start screen, type Defragment, and launch Disk Defragmenter in Windows 7 or the Defragment and optimize your drives tool in Windows 8. The tool will analyze your drives and determine whether you need to defragment them. Note that Windows 7’s Disk Defragmenter should refuse to defragment solid-state drives, while Windows 8 has renamed Disk Defragmenter “Optimize Drives” because it can also optimize solid-state drives <a href="http://go.pcworld.com/defragssd" target="_self">(go.pcworld.com/defragssd)</a>.</p>

    </div><h4><b>4. Keep your system free of viruses and malware</b></h4><p>Even if you’re using antivirus software and otherwise playing it safe, new breeds of malware can sneak onto your system. The nuclear option is to reinstall Windows entirely. On Windows 8, you can use the Refresh feature <a href="http://go.pcworld.com/fresh" target="_self">(go.pcworld.com/fresh)</a>, which retains your personal files, but gives you a fresh desktop system. You’ll have to reinstall your desktop software.</p>
<p>On Windows 7, you can use your manufacturer’s recovery partition <a href="http://go.pcworld.com/partition" target="_self">(go.pcworld.com/partition)</a> or reinstall Windows 7 from an installation disc. Whichever path you take, you’ll need to clean up bloatware afterward <a href="http://go.pcworld.com/bloatware" target="_self">(go.pcworld.com/bloatware)</a>.</p>

    </div><h4><b>5. Upgrade to a newer operating system</b></h4><p>If you have an old Windows XP PC, you can try installing a lightweight Linux system on it to give it a new lease on life <a href="http://go.pcworld.com/linuxalt" target="_self">(go.pcworld.com/linuxalt)</a>.</p>
<p>You can speed up an old computer that came with Windows Vista by updating it to Windows 8.1 or even Windows 7, but you’re probably better off putting the money for a new Windows license toward newer, faster hardware.</p>
<h4><b>Hardware cleaning</b></h4><p>If your PC can’t cool itself efficiently, it may throttle down your CPU or graphics hardware. Excessive heat can damage hardware over time or cause it to unexpectedly shut down. When you hear the internal fans whirring at maximum speed during light or moderate usage, your system may be overheating.</p>
<h4><b>1. Bust the dust</b></h4><p>Give your PC’s case a regular cleaning to prevent dust buildup <a href="http://go.pcworld.com/bustdust" target="_self">(go. pcworld.com/bustdust)</a>. With the computer powered off and unplugged, open its case and spray with canned air to clean out the dust clinging to fans and vents. You can try cleaning out your laptop’s cooling fans <a href="http://go.pcworld.com/fanclean" target="_self">go.pcworld.com/fanclean)</a>, but opening up a laptop tends to be more difficult.</p>
<h4><b>2. Replace the paste</b></h4><p>A heat-dissipating thermal compound sits between both your CPU and GPU and their respective heatsinks, conducting heat from the heatgenerating chip to the fan-cooled heatsink. This paste deteriorates over time, but you can replace it. Apply a thin, flat, uniform layer</p>
<h3><b>Hardware upgrades</b></h3><p>If your PC is a decade old, you won’t be able to speed it up much with hardware upgrades—and in that case you’d be better off buying a new PC. Keeping that in mind, the following upgrades offer the most bang for your buck <a href="http://go.pcworld.com/buck" target="_self">(go.pcworld.com/buck)</a>.</p>
<h4><b>1. Replace the drives</b></h4><p>The hard disk is typically the major bottleneck in a PC. Solid-state drives are much faster than traditional magnetic hard drives, although they offer less storage space per dollar <a href="http://go.pcworld.com/ssdspeed" target="_self">(go.pcworld.com/ssdspeed)</a>. You can get a 120GB SSD for $100, and a 2TB magnetic hard drive for about the same price.</p>
<p>If your PC is only a few years old, you can probably boost its speed with an SSD. You may even be able to upgrade your laptop with an SSD <a href="http://go.pcworld.com/laptopssd" target="_self">(go.pcworld.com/laptopssd.)</a></p>
<h4><b>2. Upgrade random access memory (RAM)</b></h4><p>The RAM holds your PC’s working memory. If it has too little RAM, your PC has to constantly read and write to its hard drive, slowing everything down.</p>
<p>To install RAM, power off the PC, open it up, and snap in the new sticks <a href="http://go.pcworld.com/pcram" target="_self">(go.pcworld.com/pcram)</a>. Some laptops allow easy access to their RAM slots <a href="http://go.pcworld.com/laptopram" target="_self">(go.pcworld.com/laptopram)</a>. Make sure you buy the correct type of RAM for your PC.</p>
<h4><b>3. Upgrade the CPU or graphics card</b></h4><p>If you’re an avid gamer, you may want to upgrade your PC’s graphics card <a href="http://go.pcworld.com/gupgrade" target="_self">(go.pcworld.com/gupgrade)</a>. Bear in mind that the performance bottleneck might actually be the CPU: If it isn’t fast enough, upgrading the graphics card won’t help much.</p>
<p>CPU upgrades are possible <a href="http://go.pcworld.com/cupgrade" target="_self">(go.pcworld.com/cupgrade)</a>, but Intel regularly introduces new socket formats, which means new CPUs may not fit in older motherboards. An Intel CPU won’t work in a motherboard with an AMD CPU socket, and vice versa. If you need to upgrade the motherboard as well, you may want to consider investing in a new computer <a href="http://go.pcworld.com/newpc" target="_self">(go.pcworld.com/newpc)</a>.</p>
