    </div><p><b>ONE OF THE</b> best features of Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 is the ability to pin apps to the taskbar. Until Microsoft comes out with the refreshed Start menu, pinning apps is a must-have feature for Windows 8.1 users <a href="http://go.pcworld.com/startback" target="_self">(go.pcworld.com/startback)</a>.</p>
<p>As the go-to location for dealing with and switching between open programs, the taskbar may be the most-clicked location on your desktop. But you can use a few keyboard tricks to make things even more efficient.</p>
<h3><b>Pick by number</b></h3><p>If you have a bunch of apps pinned to the taskbar, the keyboard offers a quick way to fire up or switch to one of those programs without reaching for your mouse. Press the &lt;Windows&gt; key plus the app’s position number (on Windows 8.1, the numbering starts from the left after the Windows icon—File Explorer is 1 in the example shown here). Let’s say you want to open Atom, GitHub’s new text editor, in the taskbar, and it’s in the fifth position from the left. Press &lt;Windows&gt;-4.</p>
<p>If a program is open, it immediately becomes the active window. If it’s closed, the app starts up.</p>
<p>This shortcut works with any app that currently appears on the taskbar, including those that aren’t pinned. The downside is that it works only with the first ten apps and it doesn’t work with double digits—the tenth app is 0.</p>

<p><b>When you press</b> (Shift) and right-click a closed app, the contextual menu offers an abundance of options.</p>

    </div><h3><b>Systemic approach</b></h3><p>Microsoft’s jump lists, which give you programspecific contextual menus when you rightclick an app, are great. For systemwide options, press &lt;Shift&gt; and then right-click. If the program is open, you’ll only see options to adjust or move the window. Closed apps, however, offer a much larger set of choices.</p>

    </div><h3><b>Spotlight</b></h3><p>If you need access to more than ten apps, try &lt;Windows&gt;-T, which lets you quickly cycle through every app on your taskbar, whether it’s open or closed. A small spotlight appears below the currently selected app’s icon.</p>
<p>When you’ve landed on the program you want, just release the keys and press &lt;Enter&gt; to either open the app or make it the active window.</p>
