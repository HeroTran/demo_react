<h3><b>Zbox EN760 Plus: Petite but great at gaming</b></h3><p>» Don’t let the size of Zotac’s tiny PC fool you. The EN760 Plus <a href="http://go.pcworld.com/en760" target="_self">(go.pcworld.com/en760)</a> has the graphics horsepower to play even the most demanding games. It costs less than a tower PC and can fit almost anywhere—including the back of your monitor or HDTV. You’ll need to provide your own keyboard, mouse, and operating system though, as these are not included.</p>
